CS480 - Standup Meeting Notes
25 February 2021

Started out by catching Toby up on our activities this week (basically recapped the notes from Tuesday and went over everything again)

Showed Toby and Will the email that I drafted to Dr. Karl
Afterwards, Will shared his screen and we dug through the code currently on GitHub that Dr. Karl uses for parsing multiple formats and applying the regex that they currently use
	- Our thinking here is that we may be able to use this script to designate entry/exit points to our pipeline from their current web architecutre. Of course, this is 
	still way off in the future, but is worth thinking about now

Next, we went over the email that I drafted to Dr. Karl and agreed that it's a decent check-in note for this week.
	- Next week, however, we will want to ask some technical questions regarding his internal format for data pulled from XML files
		- Will is going to examine the scripts further over the weekend and determine what specifically we want to ask about

Action items:
	- Seth and Toby: Draft bronze-to-gold parsing scripts for Geoderma (Toby) and RSE (Seth) datasets
	- Will: Read up further on the current regex implementation in the JournalMap GitHub, draft email to Dr. Karl
	- Will and Toby: Create accounts for the AWS and Databricks free tiers so that we can begin pipeline construction
