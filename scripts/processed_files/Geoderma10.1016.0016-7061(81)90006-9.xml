Exchange equilibria of potassium versus calcium-  plus-magnesium in soils of arid and semi-arid regions, India. Geoderma, 25: 55--62.    Exchange equilibria of potassium vs. calcium + magnesium were studied on samples of  eight soils derived from alluvium but differing in CEC, texture and other properties. The K+  exchange isotherms were drawn using solutions of different potassium adsorption ratios  (PARs), i.e., 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 50 and 100 mmolvs 1-v2 at a  total electrolyte concentration of 50 me.1-1. The specificity of the exchange s:tes for K+  decreased first abruptly and then gradually with increasing PAR of the equilibrium solu-  tion. The Gapon coefficient (KG) vs. exchangeable potassium percentage (EPP) curves  were arbitrarily divided into three broad classes of specificities. The maximum, medium  and minimum specificities for K+ adsorption were attributed to the edge-interlayer sites  of mica, the sites in wedge-shaped interlayers of partially weathered mica and intergrade  miea--montmorillonite packets, and the planar sites, respectively. The first two zones of  specificities were explained on the basis of geometric configuration of exchange sites and  the last on the basis of electrostatic forces, using the theory of a diffuse double layer.  The normalized exchange isotherms showed that at low EPP the equivalent ion frac-  tion of K+ on the exchange complex was greater than that in the equilibrium solution,  whereas the reverse was true at high EPP, the inflexion point being dependent on soil  type. The selectivity coefficients for K+--(Ca=+ Mg2+) were calculated using the  Vanselow (Kv ), Krishnamoorthy-Davis-Overstreet ~KKDo )and Scheffer-Ulrich (KSU)  equations. None of these coefficients was found to be constant with K+ saturation show-  ing thereby the inability of these equations to predict K+--(Ca:+ + Mg~+) exchange in  these soils.    INTRODUCTION    Crops respond generally to fertilization with nitrogen and also in many  cases to phosphorus in soils of ~rid and semi-arid regions. Their responses to  K however, are limited and erratic. Available K+ status of such soils, as in-  dicated by simple soil tests fail~,~ to predict crop responses to this nutrient  element. This failure may be attributed mainly to the differences in adsom-  tion--release patterns of Kby soil minerals. Knibbe and Thomas (1972),  Schalscha et al. (1975) and Rasnake and Thomas (1976), from their work    aal~ ~n=l I~1 lnnnn--nnnnlg 9~ .50 1981 Elsevier Scientific Pul~lishing Company    56    on K+--Ca2+ exchange equilibria, reported considerable differences in the ad-  sorption--release patterns of K+ among soils.  Cation exchange equilibria studies with various cation pairs in softs and  clays have recently been reviewed by Pal and Poonia (1978). Some work on  Na+--Ca2. exchange equilibria in relation to factors such as soil type, organ-  ic manuring and agro-climatic zones is available (Poonia and Talibudeen,  1977; Poonia and Pal, 1979a,b). Similar studies of K+--(Ca2+ + Mg2+) ex-  change have not been made for alluvial soils in arid and semi-arid regions.  As Ca2+ and Mg2+ axe the major competing ions in these softs, a study has  been made of the relative adsorption affinity for K+ vs. (Ca2. + Mg2.) from  the point of view of K+ nutrition. This paper reports the adsorption be-  haviour of K+ vs. (Ca2+ + Mg2+) in samples of eight soils. The experimental  results were expressed in terms of tabulated values of the Gapon exchange  coefficient, KG, and an estimate of the standard Gibbs free energy of ex-  change was derived therefrom. Various exchange equations were scrutinized  for constancy of the relevant coefficients.    EXPERIMENTAL    Surface samples (0--15 cm) from eight different locations were collected,  ground and passed through a 0.5-ram sieve. Some of the physico-chemical  properties of these soil samples are given in Table I. The soil samples were  made homoionic by treatment with decreasing concentrations (1.0--0.1 N)  of CaC12 solution followed by washing with 80% ethanol and finally by  petroleum ether. The samples so prepared were aixdried, ground and again  passed through a 0.5-mm sieve.  Solutions with different potassium adsorption ratios (PARs) of 0.1, 0.2,  ~A  lh  0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 50 and 100 mmol  1-  at a total elec-  trolyte concentration of 50 me.1-1 were prepared using chloride salts of K+  Ca2. and Mg2+.

Homoionic samples were equilibrated with solutions of different  PARs at a 1:20 solution ratio. Analyses were made for Caz+ + Mg2+ and K+  in solution. Exchangeable K+ was calculated from the depletion of this ion  in the equilibrating solution. The cation exchange capacity minus exchange-  able K+ was designated as exchangeable (Ca2+ + Mg2+). K+ was determined  with a flame photometer and (Ca2+ + Mg2+) by EDTA titration.    Calculations    The various exchange coefficients were calculated by the following  equations:    KG = N+/N++ (a++)~h/a+  (Gapon, 1933)    (1)    where N+ and N++ ,are the equivalent ion fractions on the exchange com-  plex and a+ and a++ are the activities (moll-1) in the equilibrium solution  of monovalent and divalent cations, respectively: The activity coefficients  of the ions in solutions were calculated using the extended form of the  Debye-Huckel equation.  (M+)2a++  KKDO = M++(U++M++ + M+~(a+)2   (Krishnamoorthy et al., 1948)  (2)  where M+ and M++ are the mole fractions of the mono- and divalent  cations on the exchange complex, respectively. U++ = 2(Y - 1)/Y, with Y  as the number of exchange sii, es influencing a giveJl site. For eq. 2 Y was  taken as 6. If Y = 2, eq. 2 becomes:  (M+ )2    a++  Kv =  M++   (a+):   (Vanselow, 1932)                          (3)    The standard Gibbs free energy change (AGr) of the exchange reaction,  viz., Casoil + 2 K+ -&gt; 2 Ksoil + Ca2+, was calculated as:  O  AGr  -RT In K  (Gaines and Thomas, 1953)                      (4)  where K is the thermodynamic exchange constant.

Decreases were from 33.5 to 1.7  (EPP 10.4--70.3), 33.4 to 1.0 (EPP 10.3--60.7), 25.0 tG !.5 (EPP 8.1--67.4),  21.9 to 3.2 (EPP 8.3--79.2}, 14.3 to 2.4 (EPP 6.1--69.1), 13.1 to 2.1 (EPP  5.5--66.7), 19.2 to 2.3 (EPP 8.0--69.0), and 19.4 to 1.9 (EPP 5.6--73.3) for  the Kurukshetra, Ambala, Gurgaon, Hissar, Kamal, Jind, Hansi and Palampur  samples, respectively.  Keeping in view the sharpness of the decrease in KG with EPP, we divided  the exchange isotherms into three broad classes, representing exchange sites  with high, medium and low specificities for K The arbitrary limits of EPP  for these classes were different for different soil samples (Table III). The  magnitude of exchange sites with minimum specificity was highest (i.e.,  60--80% of cation exchange capacity, CEC), followed by medium (i.e.,  10--25% of CEC) al~d then by high specificity (i.e., 7--20% of CEC) sites. A  similar trend in specificities for K+ in different zones of exchange isotherms  of soils and clays was observed earlier by Bolt et al. (1963), Schouwenburg  and Schuffelen (1963), Tucker (1967), Deist and Talibudeen (1967),  Schalscha et al. (1975) and Rasnake and Thomas (1976). Rich and Black  (1964) and Knibbe and Thomas (1972) identified such exchange sites as edge-  interlayer sites (mica), wedge-shaped interlayer sites (intergrade mica-  montmoriUonite packets and partially weathered mica) and planar sites (main.  ly on montmorillonite). The values of KG in relation to Ksaturation for the  soils sampled for this study compare well with those observed by Carson and  Dixon (1972) for coarse montmoriilonite. A comparison between the drop in  the values of KG for our samples and that reported by Udo (1978) for  kaolinitic soils (i.e., KG 6.1--3.4 mmol-~ 1~, for EPP 10-67) suggests that  kaolinite, if present, forms only a small fraction of the total clay. The values  of KG at relatively low K+ saturation (i.e., EPP &lt; 20) are much higher in the  Kurukshetra, Ambala and Gurgaon samples than in those for Hissar, Karnal,  Jind, Hansi and Palampur samples, whereas at high K+ saturation (i.e., EPP &gt;  40) the reverse is true. The magnitude of KG at low K+ saturation, where K+    60    adsorption is believed to be governed mainly by edge-interlayer and wedge-  shaped interlayer sites (i.e., geometry of exchange sites}, suggests relative  dominance of fllite and intergrade mica-montmorillonite in the former  group as evidenced by the X-ray diffractograms (B.P. Singh, pets. comm.,  1979). At high K+ saturation the values of KG, mainly governed by adsorp-  tion on planar sites (i.e., surface charge density, SCD) were relatively higher  for the latter group of ~o~is. This suggests that the soils of this group have  dominance of montmorillonite with relatively low SCD. This is in con-  sonance with the theory of diffuse double layer which predicts that the  preference for a monovalent cation in a mono-divalent cationic system de-  creases with the increase in SCD of the exchanger. Consequently, an in-  crease in the preference for K+ with the increase in SCD, as reported by  Knibbe and Thomas (1972) at low K+ saturation (i.e., EPP ,~ 25) for differ-  ent soil clays and bentonite cannot be explained by this theory because of  geometric effects near edges and in interlayers.  The values of va~.ohs exchange selectivity coefficients, viz., KKDO, KV,  KN and KSU, were calculated for different EPPs using equations 2, 3, 6 and  7, respectively. None of these coefficients remained reasonably constant  throughout the exchange isotherm. The decreasing order of variation in rela-  tion to EPP was KSU, KN, KKDO, KV. The values of these coefficients first  decreased sharply and then gradually with an increase in EPP. Such varia-  tiorls in selectivity coefficients may be attributed either to involvement of  more than one anionic group on the exchange complex or to non-  electrostatic interaction between the exchange sites and the competing cat-  ions. Baligar et al. (1978) earlier reported a decrease in the magnitude of KV,  KKDO and KG with increasing K+ saturation in histosols.  The normalized exchange isotherms of K+ {Fig. 1) show that approx-  imately the first third of the isotherms lie above the diagonal and the rest  below it. This indicates that in the low K+ saturation zone apparent  specificity of the exchanger for K+ was greater than that for (Ca2+ + Mg2+),  whereas in the higher K+ saturation zone the reverse was true. The  calculated values of the Gibbs standard free energy change of exchange reac-  O  tion, AGr (eq. 4), using the smooth curve between In KN and N+ are  given in Table IV. The negative values of A Gr in all the soils, though differ-  ing in magnitudes, suggest preferential adsorption of K+ over (Ca2+ + Mg~+).  The values of Ln K (eq. 5) and hence of AGr are "estimates" only as they  involve double extrapolation of KN towards N+-*0 and N'*-~I.  The soils taken for this study, at present, do not respond to K+ fertiliza-  tion because of their high HNO3 extractable (10,000--20,000 kg per 30 cm  per ha) and available (1000 to 2000 kg per 30 cm per ha} K+ status. Due  to intensive cropping, which removes about 300 kg K+ ha-1 yr-1, the soils  are expected to be depleted of K+ in due course of time. From the existing  information, it is not possible to predict when these soils would start re-  sponding to K+ fertilization. Long-term data on K+ depletion--response pat-  terns under different crop rotations need to be procured for these soils. At    0 AMBALA                 A    ;o.2    O AMBALA                   I.

AbstractExchange equilibria of potassium vs. calcium + magnesium were studied on samples of eight soils derived from alluvium but differing in CEC, texture and other properties. The K+ exchange isotherms were drawn using solutions of different potassium adsorption ratios (PARs), i.e., 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 mmol12 lâ12 at a total electrolyte concentration of 50 me.lâ1. The specificity of the exchange sites for K+ decreased first abruptly and then gradually with increasing PAR of the equilibrium solution. The Gapon coefficient (KG) vs. exchangeable potassium percentage (EPP) curves were arbitrarily divided into three broad classes of specificities. The maximum, medium and minimum specificities for K+ adsorption were attributed to the edge-interlayer sites of mica, the sites in wedge-shaped interlayers of partially weathered mica and integrade mica-montmorillonite packets, and the planar sites, respectively. The first two zones of specificities were explained on the basis of geometric configuration of exchange sites and the last on the basis of electrostatic forces, using the theory of a diffuse double layer.The normalized exchange isotherms showed that at low EPP the equivalent ion fraction of K+ on the exchange complex was greater than that in the equilibrium solution, whereas the reverse was true at high EPP, the inflexion point being dependent on soil type. The selectivity coefficients for K+î¸(Ca2+ + Mg2+) were calculated using the Vanselow (KV), Krishnamoorthy-Davis-Overstreet (KKDO) and Scheffer-Ulrich (KSU) equations. None of these coefficients was found to be constant with K+ saturation showing thereby the inability of these equations to predict K+î¸(Ca2+ + Mg2+) exchange in these soils.
