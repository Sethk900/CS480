Project Standup Notes
16 February 2021

Today is a snow day: project team members attended standup, but Dr. Karl and other members of the JournalMap team did not

Toby and Will don't currently have access to the JournalMap Github organization
Still don't have data from Dr. Karl - Will will send an email prompting him, and also providing his GitHub username so that 
Dr. Karl can add him to the JournalMao GitHub organization
	- Toby will also send a GitHub username to be added to the organization

Regarding action items from the meeting last Thursday:
	- Team members read over Natural Language Processing (NLP) tutorials distributed via Dicord
	- Team members completed tutorials provided in these articles
	- Will and Toby still somewhat behind on logbook entries

Action items between now and Thursday:
	- (Will and Toby) send Github usernames to Dr. Karl to be added to the JournalMap GitHub organization
	- (Will) remind Dr. Karl to provide sample data

Provided that Dr. Karl does not deliver sample data to our fileshare by Thursday or further communicate intention to do so,
we will pull training and testing data directly from the JournalMap website. This is not ideal because it would require one of
us to use our personal machine as an intermediary between JournalMap and our team's OneDrive fileshare, but it wouldn't be the 
end of the world. 

The team also noted that we've been out of communication with Professor Bolden, our capstone supervisor. He mentioned last week
that we would likely have a class meeting this week, but the snow day today may have diminished any such intentions.
