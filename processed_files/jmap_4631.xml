Development of a doubled haploid mapping population and linkage map for the bread wheat cross Kariega × Avocet SA doubled haploid wheat population of 150 lines was constructed from the F1 of a cross between cultivars Kariega and Avocet S using the wheat-maize technique. Segregation and linkage analysis of 203 DNA markers, two storage protein markers and the stem rust resistance gene Sr26 yielded 31 linkage groups of which 28 were chromosome-anchored. These linkage groups covered the entire genome of 21 chromosomes. SSR markers were advantageous for chromosome anchoring and AFLP markers for consolidation of the various linkage groups. A significant feature of the linkage map is a relatively low level of polymorphism for markers on the D genome, viz, 18.5% of all markers mapped. The Kariega × Avocet S doubled haploid population and linkage maps have emerged as valuable resources for further genetic studies of qualitative and quantitative traits of economic importance in bread wheat.
