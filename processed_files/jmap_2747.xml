Snowball morphology and SEM analysis of pedogenic gypsum, southern New Mexico, USALate Quaternary soils in southern New Mexico support previous work that suggested pedogenic gypsum accumulates in successive stages as a function of time, similar to pedogenic carbonate. However, gypsum also occurs as small (0.5-1 mm), powdery spheres that we term snowball morphology. The snowball morphology represents one of the initial stages of pedogenic gypsum development. Scanning electron microscope analyses indicate that soil microorganisms and organic material may play a crucial role in the development of this morphology. However, no trends were found in the crystal habits of gypsum suggesting the snowball morphology forms in a dynamic environment. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.
