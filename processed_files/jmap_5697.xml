New species of Brodskius, Rythabis, and Omorius (Crustacea: Calanoida) from deep Antarctic watersThree new species of rare benthopelagic clausocalanoidean genera with sensory setae on the maxilla are described from female specimens collected during the German Antarctic expeditions ANDEEP Iâ€“III in 2002 and 2005, mainly from abyssal depths close to the sea bed. Brodskius abyssalis sp. nov. differs from congeners by the lack of rostral filaments, two setae on the second segment of antenna exopod, threadâ€like tips of maxillary wormâ€like sensory setae, and the length of spines of P5 exopod. Rythabis assymmetrica sp. nov. is distinguished from other species in the genus by asymmetrical posterior corners of the prosome, the shape of spermathecae, and setal numbers on the maxillulary distal basal endite plus endopod. Omorius curvispinus sp. nov. is characterized by strongly curved setae of the maxillipedal syncoxa, a comparatively long seta on the basis of antenna, a slightly swollen genital doubleâ€somite, and the shape of spermathecae. The genera Brodskius, Omorius, and Rythabis are recorded for the first time from the southern hemisphere.
