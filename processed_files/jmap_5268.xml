Two new species of the family Photidae (Amphipoda: Corophiidea: Photoidea) from Brazilian waters, with description of Rocasphotis gen. nov.A new species, Photis sarae sp. nov., is herein described from Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro. The new species is similar to the Hawaiian species, Photis hawaiensis Barnard, 1955, and an undescribed species, Photis sp. F (LeCroy 2000), from Biscayne Bay, Florida. Photis sarae sp. nov. can be distinguished from both species in having gnathopod 2 basis with two long setae on posterior margin, palm with only one spine (excluding palmar corner), pereopod 3 anterior margin of merus with long plumose and simple setae, and dactyli of pereopods 5–7 with accessory spine and telson trapezoidal with distal margin concave. Also, Rocasphotis gen. nov. is described based on material collected from Atol das Rocas, which is closely related to the genus Photis and also corresponds to a new species. Rocasphotis gen. nov. mainly differs from Photis in having antenna 1 shorter than antenna 2, peduncular article 1 longer than article 3, accessory flagellum absent, coxae 1–4 with sparse slender setae; lateral cephalic lobe weakly extended and acute distally; eyes large, poorly developed, composed of sparse ommatidia, and partly enclosed in the lobe. A key for all genera of the family Photidae is given.
