Surveys of Viruliferous Alate Aphid of               Plum pox virus               in               Prunus mume               Orchards in JapanPlum pox virus (PPV) is transmitted by infected buds and aphids. It is important to analyze the outbreak trends and viruliferous rate of aphids in areas where the occurrence of PPV is reported, so as to develop strategies for disease control. Between April 2011 and December 2012, yellow insect-trapping adhesive plates were placed for 2 days at a time each week in an area where PPV is occurring in Japan. Outbreak trends were analyzed based on the trapped alate aphid samples, and up to 50 of them were tested per week to identify species and determine the rate of viruliferous specimens. Although the number of aphids varied according to survey year, three peaks were noticeable in each year. Based on the sequence data for the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I region, approximately 40 different species of aphid were trapped in both years. Of the five dominant species of aphids identified during the 2 years, Aphis spiraecola was trapped in large numbers. PPV-positive aphids were higher in fall onward, when the total number of trapped aphids decreased, than in spring and summer, when a larger number of aphids was caught. PPV transmission tests using the most abundant species revealed that A. spiraecola, A. craccivora, A. gossypii, and Rhopalosiphum maidis were transmitters, although A. spiraecola is likely of epidemiological significance.
