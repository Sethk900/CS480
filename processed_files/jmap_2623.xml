LOCAL POPULATION SIZE IN A FLIGHTLESS INSECT: IMPORTANCE OF PATCH STRUCTURE-DEPENDENT MORTALITY.In spatially heterogeneous systems, utilizing population models to integrate the effects of multiple population rates can yield powerful insights into the relative importance of the component rates. The relative importance of demographic rates and dispersal in shaping the distribution of the western tussock moth (<em>Orgyia vetusta</em>) among patches of its host plant was explored using stage-structured population models. Tussock moth dispersal occurs passively in first-instar larvae and is poor or absent in all other life stages. Spatial surveys suggested, however, that moth distribution is not well explained by passive dispersal; moth populations were greater on small patches and on isolated ones. Further analysis showed that several local demographic rates varied significantly with patch characteristics. Two mortality factors in particular may explain the observed patterns. First, crawler mortality both increased with patch size and was density-dependent. A single-patch difference equation model showed mortality related to patch size is strong enough to overcome the homogenizing effect of density dependence; greater equilibrium densities were predicted for smaller patches. Second, although three rates were found to vary with local patch density, only pupal parasitism by a chalcid wasp could potentially account for higher moth abundances on isolated patches. A spatially explicit simulation model of the multiple-patch system showed that spatial variation in pupal parasitism is indeed strong enough to generate such a pattern. These results demonstrate that habitat spatial structure can affect multiple population processes simultaneously, and even relatively low attack rates imposed on a reproductively valuable life stage of the host can have a dominant effect on population distribution among habitat patches.
