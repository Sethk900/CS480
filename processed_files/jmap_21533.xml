Apoxyria hirtuosa (Wiedemann, 1821) comb. n., lectotype designation, redescription and identification key to species of Apoxyria Schiner, 1866 (Asilidae, Laphriinae)Abstract The type specimens of Neodiogmites hirtuosus (Wiedemann, 1821), two males and one female, deposited at the Museum für Naturkunde der Humboldt-Universität (ZMHB), Berlin were examined. The specimens show the diagnostic characters of Apoxyria Schiner, 1866: face strongly pronounced, swollen and curved hind tibia, and terminalia with epandrium large and hypandrium short and obtuse. A new combination is suggested, Apoxyria hirtuosa (Wiedemann, 1821), and lectotype and paralectotypes are designated. The species is redescribed, the male terminalia is described and illustrated for the first time, and an identification key to Apoxyria is presented.
