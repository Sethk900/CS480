 The evolutionary and biomechanical implications of snout and proboscis morphology in Caenogastropoda (Mollusca: Gastropoda)The caenogastropod proboscis is a complex morphological adaptation to a carnivorous diet. This comparative morphological investigation of proboscis and snout anatomy in Caenogastropoda shows that there is undescribed diversity in both snout/proboscis wall composition and introversion/retraction musculature. There is morphological evidence which suggests that a proboscis evolved separately in at least four separate caenogastropod groups, each characterized by the presence of novel retractor muscles and different modifications of plesiomorphic â€œaortic musclesâ€. The biomechanical operation of the proboscis and snout utilizes a hydrostatic skeleton, but several higher caenogastropods have evolved a complex muscular hydrostat in the snout/proboscis wall which may mitigate the need to isolate the proboscis haemocoel during proboscis eversion.
