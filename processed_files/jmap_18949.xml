Contribution of root respiration to soil surface CO2 flux in a boreal black spruce chronosequenceWe quantified the contributions of root respiration (RC) and heterotrophic respiration to soil surface CO2 flux (R-s) by comparing trenched and untrenched plots in well-drained and poorly drained stands of a black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) fire chronosequence in northern Manitoba, Canada. Our objectives were to: (1) test different equations for modeling R-s as a function of soil temperature; and (2) model annual R-s and RC for the chronosequence from continuous soil temperature measurements. The choice of equation to model R-s strongly affected annual R-s and RC, with an Arrhenius-based model giving the best fit to the data, especially at low temperatures. Modeled values of annual R-s were positively correlated with soil temperature at 2-cm depth and were affected by year of burn and trenching, but not by soil drainage. During the growing season, measured RC was low in May, peaked in late July and declined to low values by the end of the growing season. Annual RC was < 5% of R-s in the recently burned stands, similar to40% in the 21-year-old stands and 5-15% in the oldest (152-year-old) stands. Evidence suggests that RCc may have been underestimated in the oldest stands, with residual root decay from trenching accounting for 5-10% of trenched plot R-s at most sites.
