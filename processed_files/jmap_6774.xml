Osmoconditioning of seeds of sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.)Germination rate of seeds of sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) cv. Florida Resistant Giant was increased significantly at both 15 °C and 25 °C after osmotic priming for 10 days at 15 °C in solutions of polyethylene glycol. Post-treatment drying of the seeds had little effect on subsequent germination rate at 25 °C. The germination rate was, however, depressed at 15 °C. Cold-priming the seeds at 15 °C for 10 days resulted in a germination rate at 25 °C which compared well to that of osmotic priming treatments. S. Afr. J. Plant Soil 1985, 2: 161 −163
