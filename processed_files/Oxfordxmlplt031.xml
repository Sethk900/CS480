ACC oxidase ( Malus. domestica  ACCO1) catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of the plant hormone ethylene. ACCO converts 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid(ACC) to ethylene, cyanide, carbon dioxide and water in the presence of ferrous ion, oxygen, ascorbic acid and bicarbonate. Cyanide, a product of the reaction, activates ACCO. Site-directed mutagenesis investigations revealed binding sites for ACC, bicarbonate and ascorbic acid to include; Arg175, Arg244, Ser246, Lys158, Lys292, Arg299 and Phe300. ACCO may be involved in the ethylene signal transduction pathway not directly linked to the ACCO reaction through post-translational modifications. ACCO is subject to auto-phosphorylaton  in vitro  and promotes phosphorylation of some apple fruit proteins in a ripening-dependent manner.  1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) oxidase (ACCO) catalyses the final step in ethylene biosynthesis converting ACC to ethylene, cyanide, CO 2 , dehydroascorbate and water with inputs of Fe(II), ascorbate, bicarbonate (as activators) and oxygen. Cyanide activates ACCO. A â€˜nestâ€™ comprising several positively charged amino acid residues from the C-terminal Î±-helix 11 along with Lys158 and Arg299 are proposed as binding sites for ascorbate and bicarbonate to coordinately activate the ACCO reaction. The binding sites for ACC, bicarbonate and ascorbic acid for  Malus domestica  ACCO1 include Arg175, Arg244, Ser246, Lys158, Lys292, Arg299 and Phe300. Glutamate 297, Phe300 and Glu301 in Î±-helix 11 are also important for the ACCO reaction. Our proposed reaction pathway incorporates cyanide as an ACCO/Fe(II) ligand after reaction turnover. The cyanide ligand is likely displaced upon binding of ACC and ascorbate to provide a binding site for oxygen. We propose that ACCO may be involved in the ethylene signal transduction pathway not directly linked to the ACCO reaction. ACC oxidase has significant homology with  Lycopersicon esculentum  cysteine protease LeCp, which functions as a protease and as a regulator of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase ( Acs2 ) gene expression. ACC oxidase may play a similar role in signal transduction after post-translational processing. ACC oxidase becomes inactivated by fragmentation and apparently has intrinsic protease and transpeptidase activity. ACC oxidase contains several amino acid sequence motifs for putative proteinâ€“protein interactions, phosphokinases and cysteine protease. ACC oxidase is subject to autophosphorylaton  in vitro  and promotes phosphorylation of some apple fruit proteins in a ripening-dependent manner.  Structure of the ACCO monomer. The side chains of Fe(II) binding residues (His177, Asp179 and His234) are shown in ball and stick form. Î±-Helix 11 folds over the reaction site upon ACC binding ( Yoo  et al.  2006 ;  Brisson  et al . 2012 ). From:  Zhang  et al.  (2004) .  Chemistry and Biology   11 :1383â€“1394 (with permission from  Chemistry and Biology ).  In our investigations, native and mutant ACCO (ACCO1 from apple,  Malus domestica ) were expressed in  Escherichia coli  as His-Tag fusion proteins and purified. Steady-state enzyme kinetic experiments were performed to determine the binding sites for ACC, bicarbonate and Asc, and gain insights into the ACCO reaction mechanism. The enzyme reaction during normal turnover has an absolute dependence on Fe(II), Asc and oxygen, and requires bicarbonate for activation. His177, Asp179 and His234 are ligands for iron ( Shaw  et al.  1996 ;  Kadyrzhanova  et al.  1999 ). These His and Asp residues comprise a 2-Hisâ€“1-Asp facial triad common to other mononuclear non-haem iron(II) enzymes ( Hegg and Que 1997 ). ACC is bound to the iron centre via its amino and carboxyl groups according to spectroscopic studies with ACCO using nitric oxide (NO) as an oxygen surrogate ligand ( Rocklin  et al.  1999 ). Bidentate binding of ACC was confirmed by  Tierney  et al.  (2005) . Unless mentioned otherwise, the numbering of amino acid residues refers to the sequence of apple ( M. domestica ) ACCO1.  The wild-type cDNA of apple ACCO ( Wilson  et al . 1993 ) was cloned into the expression vector pET15b (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI, USA). The mutant forms of apple ACCO were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Transformerâ„¢ Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Clontech Laboratories Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA )  according to the manufacturer's instructions. The introduced point mutations were verified by manual sequencing using the Sequenase Version 2 DNA Sequencing Kit (USB Corp., Cleveland, OH, USA). The resulting gene constructs were transformed into  E. coli  strand BL21 (DE)  plysS  (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI, USA). The bacterial cells were grown at 30 Â°C until reaching OD 600  = 0.3, recombinant protein expression was induced by adding 1 mM isopropyl - Î² -  d -thiogalactoside (IPTG) and induction was continued for an additional 3 h at 30 Â°C before harvesting. The harvested bacterial cells were lysed by the freezeâ€“thaw method. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 39 000  g  for 20 min to remove cell debris. The fusion protein was purified from the supernatant (the crude extract) by using Ni 2+ -charged affinity chromatography (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI, USA) and ammonium sulfate precipitation. In general, the purification of both wild-type and mutant forms yields âˆ¼0.5 mg of ACCO recombinant protein per litre of induced culture. The purity of the ACCO recombinant protein was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfateâ€“polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSâ€“PAGE) analysis and immunoblot analysis using ACCO monoclonal antibody. ACC oxidase activity was assayed in  E. coli  cell lysate (the crude extract) and after purification as the fusion protein. The wild-type (native) ACCO recombinant protein was always prepared in parallel and assayed along with the mutant forms of ACCO.  ACC oxidase assay was conducted in 5-mL stoppered vials at 20 Â°C for 20 min. Assays included  l -ascorbate (3 mM), 20 mM NaHCO 3 , dithiothreitol (DTT) (1 mM), ACC (1 mM), 20 ÂµM ferrous sulfate and 3-( N -morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) (50 mM, pH 7.2) in 10 % glycerol in a final volume of 1 mL. The reaction was started by adding 18 or 36 Âµg of the purified ACCO His-Tag fusion protein or 50 ÂµL of the crude extract (prior to Ni 2+  affinity column purification) was added last to the assay medium. The reaction vials were shaken horizontally at 60 strokes per min. The activity of the recombinant ACCO fusion protein was similar to that of ACCO purified from apples employing the procedure of  Dong  et al . (1992) . Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford procedure. Ethylene analyses were performed by injecting 1 mL of the vial headspace into a gas chromatograph employing an alumina column and a flame ionization detector. The ethylene assay readily measured 5 ppbv. Kinetic parameters were determined using PlotIT 3.2 software. The values of  K  m  and  K  a  reported in the figures and tables for ACCO mutants are apparent values although reaction velocities versus concentration of those mutants directly affecting the binding sites for substrates and activators often did not display typical Michaelisâ€“Menten kinetics. This was most often the case when assaying mutants with bicarbonate varied where bicarbonate activation was linear rather than hyperbolic. After we discovered that ACCO inactivation was largely spared by pretreating ACCO with cyanide (0.5 mM) and Î±-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) (0.5 mM), we included AIB and cyanide in enzyme assays.  Preliminary studies of alternative substrates for ACCO revealed an unexpected activation and protection from inactivation when cyanide and AIB were included in an assay with ACC. Studies of cyanide activation were conducted with the ACCO His-Tag fusion protein after cutting the N-terminal His-Tag leader sequence with thrombin. The recombinant ACCO fusion protein has the sequence Gly âˆ’4 â€“Ser âˆ’3 â€“His âˆ’2 â€“Met âˆ’1  on the N-terminal Met. The enzyme was desalted in 50 mM MOPS (pH 7.2) and 10 % (v/v) glycerol with a PD-10 column and stripped of iron and residual nickel on an uncharged iminodiacetate column. The enzyme was stored at âˆ’80 Â°C in 50 mM MOPS (pH 7.2) and 10 % glycerol. The molar extinction coefficient ( Îµ ) of purified ACCO at 280 nm was determined to be 2.41 Ã— 10 4  M âˆ’1  cm âˆ’1  and was used to calculate ACCO concentrations for the assays.  Enzyme activity was assayed at 20 Â°C in 1 mL of a reaction mixture consisting of 50 mM MOPSâ€“HCl (pH 7.2), 3 mM  l -ascorbate, 20 ÂµM FeSO 4 , 20 mM NaHCO 3 , 1 mM DTT, 10 % (v/v) glycerol and 1 mM ACC in 5-mL stoppered vials shaken horizontally at 60 strokes per min. The assay duration was 20 min and was initiated by the addition of the enzyme at a final concentration of 1 ÂµM unless stated otherwise. Deviations from this assay composition are stated in the figure legends. Ethylene in the vial headspace was determined by gas chromatography. Typical activity ranged from 0.7 to 1.3 nmol ethylene per nmol ACCO min âˆ’1  ( k  cat/min ).  Examination of the amino acid sequence of ACCO revealed several sequence motifs for putative post-translational activities. This was not surprising given the important role that ethylene has in all phases of plant growth and development. These are listed in TableÂ  3  and include motifs for serine/threonine kinases, tyrosine kinase, proteinâ€“protein binding and cysteine protease. To examine developmentally related kinase activity, a particulate membrane fraction of pre- and postclimacteric apple fruit proteins was incubated in [Î³- 32 P]ATP in an  in vitro  phosphorylation assay for 30 min in the absence (âˆ’) or presence (+) of the ACCO fusion protein or with ACCO alone. The incubation mixtures were then passed through a Ni 2+  affinity column with the His-Tag ACCO fusion protein attached to bind any proteins in the assay extracts capable of binding to ACCO through proteinâ€“protein interactions. The affinity column was eluted with imidazole. Proteins in the eluate (including the His-Tag ACCO) were subjected to SDSâ€“PAGE. The gel slab was then exposed to X-ray film and stained with Coomassie Blue.  Kinetic parameters for ACCO mutants for ACC, ascorbic acid and bicarbonate binding sites. ACC oxidase activity was determined with crude lysate of the ACCO fusion protein using the standard assay. ND, not determined.  Kinetic parameters for miscellaneous ACCO mutants influencing enzyme activity and binding sites for ACC, Asc and bicarbonate. ACC oxidase activity was determined using the ACCO fusion protein and standard assay. ND, not determined.  Ser246 and Arg244 are ACC binding sites in ACCO. Thr157 is essential for ACCO activity in a protein structure role. The ACC  K  m  is greatly elevated for the Ser246Ala and Arg244Lys mutants. The standard assay was employed using crude lysate with ACC varied. ACC oxidase activity is virtually non-detectable for the triple mutant (Ser246Ala/Arg244Lys/Thr157Ala).  Bicarbonate pretreatment is sufficient to protect and activate ACCO. Purified recombinant ACCO was incubated with or without 20 mM bicarbonate on ice for 20 min. Then 1 nmol ACCO was assayed at 20 Â°C with (open circles) or without (open squares) 20 mM bicarbonate. Assay with 20 mM bicarbonate (open triangles). Assay without bicarbonate (open diamonds). Full bicarbonate activation is achieved after 30 min as a consequence of cyanide accumulation during reaction turnover.  Arg175 is a critical residue for bicarbonate activation as a bicarbonate binding site or in a structural role. The low activity of the Arg175Glu and Arg175Gln mutants is linear with bicarbonate concentration, indicating a lack of a binding site. The Arg175Lys mutant with a positive charge is about one-third as active as the native ACCO. The standard assay was employed using crude lysate with bicarbonate varied.  Lysine-specific reagent ( N -hydroxysulfosuccinimide) inhibits ACCO at 1/1 and 2/1 (mol/mol) ratios. Treatment of ACCO (18.6 Âµmol) with reagent; circles, 2 min; squares, 5 min; and triangles, 10 min. The reaction was stopped with  l -alanine (50 ÂµM final concentration). The experiment was repeated using 10-, 15- and 20-min treatment times and all treatment times gave results similar to that of the 10-min time shown.  Pyridoxal 5â€²-phosphate is a competitive inhibitor of ACCO with respect to Asc  [ see Supporting Information ] . The ACCO fusion protein was employed in the standard assay with Asc varied with four concentrations of PLP (0 mM, circles; 100 mM, squares; 200 mM, triangles; 300 mM, diamonds). Pyridoxal 5â€²-phosphate may form a Schiff base with the Îµ-amino group of lysine blocking a binding site for Asc. This is likely to be Lys292 shown to be essential for Asc activation as shown in FigureÂ  7 .  Lysine292 is an Asc binding site in ACCO (upper panel). The ACCO activity of the Lys292Glu mutant is âˆ¼3 % that of the native ACCO and is not activated by Asc nor inhibited by PLP while the native ACCO is competitively inhibited by PLP with respect to Asc. The low residual activity of the Lys292Glu mutant is typically activated by bicarbonate (TableÂ  1 ). The standard assay was employed using the ACCO fusion protein with Asc varied (lower panel).  The Phe300Gln mutant is not activated by bicarbonate concentrations &lt;2 mM. Above 2 mM bicarbonate, ACCO activity increases in a linear (non-saturable) manner, indicating that the binding site for bicarbonate is not functional. Phe300 cannot bind bicarbonate. The Phe300Gln Asc  K  a  = 0.52 mM and is a high-affinity binding site for Asc, indicating that Phe300 is essential for bicarbonate activation of ACCO.  Lys158 is a high-affinity Asc binding site. The Lys158Leu mutant has very low activity and is not activated by Asc concentrations &lt;1 mM. The crude lysate of the ACCO fusion protein was employed in the standard assay.  Î±-Aminoisobutryric acid is an alternative substrate for ACCO producing acetone, ammonia and CO 2 . In the presence of cyanide (CN âˆ’ ) and AIB, ACCO is activated and enzyme inactivation is prevented. Without CN âˆ’  and AIB, ACCO is inactivated. Cyanide or AIB alone only partially prevents inactivation. The ACCO fusion protein was incubated without cyanide and AIB (open circles), 250 ÂµM KCN plus 250 ÂµM AIB (open squares) or 500 ÂµM KCN plus 250 ÂµM AIB (open triangles) for up to 2 h in the standard assay without ACC. During this time, AIB was presumed to be oxidized to products. At the times indicated, aliquots of the assay mixture were assayed in the standard assay with ACC.  Cyanide activates ACCO. Cyanide activation begins at 100 ÂµM, is maximal at ca. 0.5 mM and becomes inhibitory beyond 1 mM. One nmole of ACCO (1 ÂµM in standard assay) was treated with KCN at the indicated final concentrations employing the standard assay for the fusion protein.  Cyanide activates ACCO beginning at ca. 100 ÂµM and becomes inhibitory beyond 1 mM, whereas iron chelators inhibit activity at much lower concentrations. The ACCO fusion protein (1 ÂµM in assay) was assayed in the standard assay with KCN, 1,10-phenanthroline or EDTA at the concentrations indicated. The iron chelators are strongly inhibitory at 0.1 mM, whereas cyanide up to 1 mM activates ACCO.   Rocklin  et al.  (2004)  showed that ACCO is capable of doing a single turnover without Asc but only in the presence of bicarbonate and then becomes inactivated. They also introduced the notion of two Asc binding sites. One has a high affinity for Asc (Asc  K  a  = 0.2 mM) associated with initial activation of ACCO as an effector molecule, during which time Asc is not oxidized. Moreover, the effector role of Asc could be mimicked with the non-redox active Asc analogue saccharic acid 1,4-lactone. To gain further insights into a non-redox role of Asc in the ACCO reaction, we tested numerous structural analogues of Asc. We confirmed the results of  Brunhuber  et al . (2000)  and  Rocklin  et al . (2004)  showing that saccharic acid 1,4-lactone was a competitive inhibitor of ACCO with respect to Asc  [ see Supporting Information ] . We found that 2,4-pteridinediol (lumazine) competitively activated ACCO with respect to Asc  [ see Supporting Information ] . Plotting the Asc apparent  K  a  value vs. 2,4-pteridinediol concentration from the double reciprocal plot yielded a  K  a  = 2.2 mM similar to the Asc  K  a  of 2.58 mM.  ACC oxidase also produces ethylene with 2,4-pteridinediol without Asc but activity is only âˆ¼14 % of that with Asc at equal concentration. 2,4,5-Triamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine competitively inhibited ACCO activity with respect to Asc  [ see Supporting Information ] , while 4,5,6-triaminopyrimidine uncompetitively activated ACCO with respect to Asc (data not shown).  l -Gulonic 1,4-lactone also uncompetitively activated ACCO (data not shown).  Recombinant apple ACCO1 with a His-Tag bound to a Ni 2+  column was employed as a protein affinity column to determine whether any proteins from apple fruit can bind to ACCO through proteinâ€“protein interactions ( Dilley  et al.  1995 ). Products of an  in vitro  phosphorylation assay conducted with a 100 000  g  membrane fraction collected from pre- and postclimacteric apple fruits in the presence or absence of recombinant ACCO were passed through the His-Tag ACCO affinity column. The column was then eluted with imidazole. This would remove the ACCO along with proteins bound to ACCO from the phosphorylation assay. The eluate was subjected to SDSâ€“PAGE analysis. A similar assay was done with ACCO only. Numerous proteins of unknown nature from both pre- and postclimacteric apple fruits became differentially phosphorylated (Fig.Â  15 A and B). Moreover, ACCO became phosphorylated when assayed separately (Fig.Â  15 A). Protein phosphorylation was more evident in postclimacteric as compared with preclimacteric fruit. A protein of âˆ¼35 kDa became more heavily phosphorylated in postclimacteric as compared with preclimacteric fruit in the presence of ACCO. This 35-kDa protein is not a breakdown product of ACCO because it is absent in lane 3 (Fig.Â  15 A). A strongly phosphorylated protein of âˆ¼70 kDa was found when ACCO was assayed separately. This protein was not detectable by Coomassie Blue staining. There was no radiolabel at the mass of ACCO for pre- and postclimacteric fruit (Fig.Â  15 A, lanes 2 and 5). The pattern of  32 P labelling differences between pre- and postclimacteric fruit suggests maturity-dependent changes in kinase and phosphatase activities.  ACC oxidase amino acids Cys28, Thr157, Lys158, Arg175, Gln188, Lys199, Arg244, Ser246, Lys230, Lys292, Glu294, Glu297, Arg299, Phe300 and Glu301 were found to be important residues affecting enzyme activity. Mutation of these amino acids differentially affects ACC  K  m , Asc  K  a  and bicarbonate  K  a  values. Arg175, Arg244 and Ser246 were determined to be important residues affecting ACC binding. The ACC  K  m  values of ACCO mutants Arg175Glu, Arg244Lys and Ser246Ala were 379, 175 and 277 ÂµM, respectively, while activity was reduced 14-, 3- and 2-fold, respectively (TableÂ  1 ). Arg175 mutants with side chains lacking a positive charge or H-bonding function had several-fold higher ACC  K  m  values and 15- to 42-fold lower activities compared with native ACCO. Lys158 (7.9 Ã… from the iron) mutants with a neutral or negative charge also exhibited elevated ACC  K  m  values, particularly as double mutants with Arg175 (TableÂ  1 ).  Bassan  et al.  (2006)  proposed that Lys158 interacts with bicarbonate in activating the ACCO reaction. The single and double mutants of Lys158 have greatly reduced activities ranging from 14- to 1000-fold. We had proposed earlier that the ACC carboxyl group may interact with the Arg244 guanidinium group and the hydroxyl group of Ser246 ( Dilley  et al.  2003 ). However, the model proposed by  Seo  et al.  (2004)  and  Yoo  et al.  (2006)  has Arg244 and Ser246 interacting with Asc. The model proposed by  Brisson  et al.  (2012)  indicates Arg244, Ser246, Lys158 and Arg299 (apple ACCO numbering) interacting with bicarbonate H-bonded to the ACC carboxylate oxygen. However, with the exception of the Arg299Glu mutant (which has no measurable activity), the other Arg299 mutants have typical ACC  K  m  values. Bicarbonate interacting with Arg244 and Ser246 has been proposed to assist orientation of ACC at the ACCO/Fe(II)/ACC reaction site ( Rocklin  et al.  2004 ). The importance of Thr157 may be to stabilize Î²-strand 4 (Fig.Â  1)   [ see Supporting Information ]  containing Lys158 essential for the reaction since the Thr157Ala mutant ACC  K  m  was similar to that of native ACCO, whereas activity was reduced 17-fold (TableÂ  1 ) and  V  max  was reduced 14-fold (Fig.Â  2 ). The triple-mutant Arg244Lys/Ser246Ala/Thr157Ala was virtually inactive (TableÂ  1  and Fig.Â  2 ).  Arginine and lysine (bearing a positive charge) are good candidates for interacting with bicarbonate. We found that bicarbonate rather than CO 2  (gas) is the species involved in ACCO activation ( Dilley  et al.  2003 ). The eight conserved Lys residues of ACCO were mutated to other residues ( Kadyrzhanova  et al.  1999 ). Among these mutants, Lys158Leu, Lys199Glu, Lys230Glu and Lys292Glu were the least active, confirming the results of  Charng  et al.  (1997) . Mutants Arg175Glu, -Gln, -His, -Ala and -Gly all lack a positive charge needed to interact with bicarbonate and have greatly elevated bicarbonate  K  a  values (TablesÂ  1  and  2 ). The Arg175Lys mutant (Lys is able to interact with bicarbonate) bicarbonate  K  a  = 6.3 mM is only slightly elevated over that of the native ACCO while its activity is reduced 5-fold, confirming results reported earlier ( Dilley  et al.  2001 ,  2003 ). The bicarbonate  K  a  of the Arg175Glu mutant was 10- to 16-fold higher than that of the native ACCO (TableÂ  1  and Fig.Â  4 ). Bicarbonate activation of the Arg175Glu mutant was non-saturable (linear vs. hyperbolic), indicating a lack of a specific binding site (Fig.Â  4 ). The Arg175Gln mutant (lacking a positive charge) activity was also linear with bicarbonate concentration (Fig.Â  4 ). This is consistent with bicarbonate binding by H-bonding/electrostatic interactions with the Arg175 guanidinium group serving as a general base to abstract H-atoms from the Lys158 amino group as proposed by  Bassan  et al.  (2006)  forming the iron peroxo (ACCO/Fe(III)â€“OOH) complex as proposed by  Rocklin  et al.  (2004) . Several amino acid side chains in ACCO apparently provide an extensive network of H-bonds to support acid/base stabilization of the transition state complex. The bicarbonate  K  a  of native ACCO is 3.1 mM, while that for the Arg175Glu mutant is 51 mM (TableÂ  1 ). Alternatively, Arg175 may serve an important structural role in bicarbonate activation. The studies of  Brisson  et al.  (2012)  show the backbone carbonyl O of Arg175 H-bonding to the Asc C 2 -OH group but the guanidinium group was not implicated as a bicarbonate binding site. Their studies show Arg244, Ser246, Lys158, Arg300 (tomato) and Tyr162 H-bonding with bicarbonate and bicarbonate H-bonding with the ACC carboxyl group. They also show Arg300 H-bonding with the C 1  carbonyl O of Asc. The  Yoo  et al.  (2006)  model shows the Arg299 guanidinium group H-bonding with bicarbonate. Additional evidence for the role of Arg175 was gained from experiments with 1,2-cyclohexanedione (1,2-CHD) that (reportedly) specifically and reversibly modifies arginyl residues ( Patthy and Smith 1975 a  ,   b  ). Following the Patthy and Smith experimental protocol, we found that 1,2-CHD inhibited native ACCO activity competitively with respect to bicarbonate raising the bicarbonate  K  a  4-fold but did not inhibit the activity of the Arg175Glu and Arg175Gln mutants (data not shown). The Arg175Lys mutant activity was inhibited by 1,2-CHD by about the same degree as that of the native ACCO, suggesting that the reagent may also have some affinity for the Lys epsilon amino group. The Arg175Lys mutant has significant activity and near-normal bicarbonate  K  a  (TableÂ  1 ). Arg175Glu mutant activity was 14-fold lower than that of native ACCO (TableÂ  1 ). The 7-fold increase in the ACC. The  K  m  of the Arg175Glu mutant may be related to the proposed role of Arg175 as a bicarbonate binding site assisting ACC binding to ACCO/Fe(II). The data are consistent with bicarbonate binding by H-bonding/electrostatic interactions with an Arg guanidinium group as for Cu,Zn-SOD ( Sankarapandi and Zweir 1999 ). The Thr157Ala mutant has a very high affinity for bicarbonate ( K  a  = 0.57 mM). This is nearly 9-fold greater than that of the native enzyme ( K  a  = 4.9 mM) and greater than that of all the other mutants studied (TableÂ  1 ) with the exception of the Phe187Tyr mutant (TableÂ  2 ). The activity of the Thr157Ala mutant is only ca. 6 % that of the native enzyme. Lys158 is also an important binding site for bicarbonate based on greatly elevated bicarbonate  K  a  values for Lys158Gln, Lys158Glu and Lys158Leu mutants, particularly as double mutants with Arg175 (TableÂ  1 ). Such large apparent bicarbonate  K  a  values indicate a lack of a binding site (linear vs. hyberbolic kinetics). The ACCO activity of these mutants was reduced 32- to 1000-fold. Removing the Arg175 and Lys158 bicarbonate binding sites virtually eliminates ACCO activity. Arg299 of apple ACCO is equivalent to Arg300 in tomato ACCO and  Brisson  et al.  (2012)  proposed Arg300 as a binding site for bicarbonate in addition to Arg244, Ser246 and Lys158. Our results largely support the modelling studies of  Brisson  et al . (2012) , implicating these residues as bicarbonate binding sites. However, we find that ACCO mutants Arg299Leu and Arg299His have ACC  K  m  and bicarbonate  K  a  values similar to those of native ACCO, whereas activity is reduced 90- to 400-fold (TableÂ  1 ). The Arg299Lys mutant ACC  K  m , Asc  K  a  and bicarbonate  K  a  values were similar to those of the native enzyme and the activity was only reduced ca. 2-fold (TableÂ  1 ). The nearly equal kinetic parameters of the Arg299Lys mutant (bearing an Îµ-amino group) and native ACCO (bearing a guanidinium group) indicate the importance of a positively charged residue for interacting with bicarbonate. The Arg299Glu mutant (bearing a carboxylate group) cannot interact with bicarbonate and has no measurable activity (TableÂ  1 ).  Bassan  et al.  (2006)  concluded (from density functional theory (DFT) calculations) that the most likely role of bicarbonate in the catalytic reaction of ACCO is to facilitate a proton transfer from the Îµ-amino group of Lys158 to the leaving OH group during the activation of ACCO/Fe(III)â•O-OH to ACCO/Fe(IV)=O. Lys158 is âˆ¼7.9 Ã… from the iron atom ( Zhang  et al.  2004 ). The close proximity of positively charged Lys296 and Arg299 from Î±-helix 11 at the reaction centre would likely lower the p K  a  of Lys158 sufficiently for this to occur ( Schmidt and Westheimer 1971 ;  Highbarger  et al . 1996 ).  Yoo  et al.  (2006)  found that both Lys296 and Arg299 (apple) are essential for ACCO activity, while our more limited studies show that the Lys296Glu mutant has near-normal activity (TableÂ  2 ). Phe300 is also important for ACCO activity. The Phe300Gln mutant had very low activity and was not activated by bicarbonate at concentrations &lt;2 mM (Fig.Â  8 ) and higher concentrations exhibited non-saturation. It exhibited a nearly 3-fold higher ACC  K  m  and a 4.4-fold lower Asc  K  a  (TableÂ  2 ). Phenylalanine would not be a binding site for bicarbonate but is required for ACCO activation. The Phe300Tyr mutant was 36-fold more active than the Phe300Gln mutant and exhibited normal values for ACC  K  m , and bicarbonate and Asc  K  a . Arg175, Arg299 and Lys158 play important roles as binding sites for bicarbonate in the ACCO reaction. Lys158 and Phe300 may also be binding sites for Asc as described below.  Ascorbic acid binds in proteins by salt bridges, H-bonding and hydrophobic interactions ( Burmeister  et al.  2000 ;  Li  et al.  2001 ).  Seo  et al.  (2004)  provided evidence that Arg244 and Ser246 (the Argâ€“Xâ€“Ser motif) interact with Asc through H-bonding. The studies of  Brisson  et al.  (2012)  indicate a role for these Arg and Ser residues in H-bonding interactions with bicarbonate. Collectively, these studies shed doubt on ACC interacting directly with Arg244 and Ser246, although mutants of these residues exhibit an elevated ACC  K  m  as we show in Fig.Â  2  and TableÂ  1 . Ascorbate can also form a Schiff base with the Lys Îµ-amino group ( McLaughlin  et al.  1980 ;  Larisch  et al.  1996 ;  Lee  et al.  1998 ). Arginine and glutamine can also form Schiff bases with Asc analogues ( Morris  et al.  1996 ). In the  Morris  et al.  (1996)  study, a Schiff base was formed between the active-site Lys146 Îµ-amino group and the carbonyl carbon of the ketose substrate of rabbit aldolase. And, the Lys146Arg mutant of rabbit aldolase was active but at a slower rate. This suggests that perhaps the Asc C 1  carbonyl carbon may also form a Schiff base with an active-site lysyl residue in ACCO. However, it is not likely that Asc forms a Schiff base in its redox active role. It may, however, do so in the non-redox role of Asc as an effector molecule ( Rocklin  et al.  2004 ). Direct evidence needed to demonstrate a Schiff base complex between Asc and a lysyl residue would require using sodium borohydride to stabilize the complex and performing subsequent peptide and amino acid analyses to prove the identity of the lysyl residue. Lys158 and Lys292 appear to be most critical for Asc activation and these may be the lysyl residues modified by the lysine-specific reagents (Fig.Â  5)   [ see Supporting Information ]  to explain PLP inhibition. Perhaps Asc may form a Schiff base with a lysyl residue in ACCO in its role as an effector molecule. This warrants further investigation. The Îµ-amino group of Lys292 is implicated as a binding site for Asc based on inability of the Lys292Glu mutant to be activated by Asc (Fig.Â  7 ). The extremely low residual activity of the Lys292Glu mutant may represent single turnovers of ACCO, after which ACCO becomes inactivated without Asc serving its normal role as a reductant during reaction turnover.  Rocklin  et al.  (2004)  conducted experiments showing that ACCO is capable of doing a single turnover without Asc (but only in the presence of bicarbonate) and subsequently is inactivated. They also introduced the notion of two Asc binding sites. One site has high affinity for Asc ( K  a  = 0.2 mM) and is associated with initial activation as an effector molecule, during which time Asc is not oxidized, while ACCO/Fe(II)â€“Oâ€“O/ACC is oxidized to ACCO/Fe(III)â•Oâ€“OH/ACC.  Mirica and Klinman (2008)  have questioned the need of an effector role for Asc based on their investigations. In any event, the effector role of Asc can be mimicked by the non-redox active Asc analogue saccharic acid 1,4-lactone ( Rocklin  et al.  2004 ). We find that saccharic acid 1,4-lactone is a competitive inhibitor with respect to Asc  [ see Supporting information ] , confirming the results of  Brunhuber  et al.  (2000)  and  Rocklin  et al.  (2004) . 2,4-Pteridinediol (lumazine) competitively activates ACCO with respect to Asc  [ see Supporting Information ] . Plotting Asc  K  a  apparent vs. 2,4-pteridinediol concentration from a double reciprocal plot of data from Fig. S5  [ see Supporting Information ]  yields a 2,4-pteridinediol  K  a  = 2.2 mM, which is similar to the Asc  K  a  of 2.58 mM. ACCO also produces ethylene with 2,4-pteridinediol in the absence of Asc but activity is only ca. 14 % compared with the same levels of Asc (data not shown). 2,4,5-Triamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine competitively inhibited ACCO activity with respect to Asc  [ see Supporting Information ] , while 4,5,6-triaminopyrimidine uncompetitively activated ACCO with respect to Asc (data not shown).  l -Gulonic 1,4-lactone also uncompetitively activated ACCO (data not shown). These results provide some evidence that there may be a binding site for Asc in a non-redox active role. This non-redox role may be as a base catalyst. Although quite speculative, perhaps this Asc may form a Schiff base with one of the two essential lysyl residues in ACCO based on our results using lysine-specific reagents and competitive inhibition of ACCO by PLP. Moreover, the study by  Brunhuber  et al.  (2000 ) (their fig.Â 5) indicates uncompetitive activation of ACCO by Asc.  Shikita  et al.  (1999)  have described uncompetitive activation of myrosinase by Asc in a non-redox role wherein it serves as a catalytic base or nucleophile ( Ettlinger  et al.  1961 ).  Burmeister  et al.  (2000)  reported that Asc is a cofactor for myrosinase and serves as a catalytic base to activate a water molecule without Asc becoming oxidized. Binding sites for Asc in myrosinase were determined by X-ray crystallography to include an Arg residue guanidinium group interacting with Asc C 1 -O and C 2 -OH.  Brisson  et al.  (2012)  proposed that the tomato ACCO Arg300 (apple Arg299) guanidinium group interacts with the Asc C 1 -O, and the Arg175 main chain carbonyl oxygen interacts with the Asc C 2  hydroxyl group. Thus, the non-redox â€˜effector roleâ€™ of Asc as proposed by  Rocklin  et al.  (2004)  may promote protein structure changes or serve as a base catalyst in the ACCO reaction.  We find that Arg299 and Arg175 are important for activity of ACCO but Arg299Lys, Arg299His and Arg299Leu mutants have  K  m  values for ACC and  K  a  values for bicarbonate similar to those of the native ACCO, while the Asc  K  a  values for the Arg299Leu and Arg299His mutants are greatly reduced (TableÂ  1 ). The results suggest that the positive charge of the Arg299 guanidinium group may be an important binding site for Asc. This would be consistent with the modelling studies of  Brisson  et al . (2012)  showing that this Arg residue H-bonds with bicarbonate and also to Asc. The Arg299Glu mutant with a negative charge would not be a binding site for either Asc or bicarbonate and has no measurable activity (TableÂ  1 ).  ACCO reaction mechanism modelled after  Mirica and Klinman (2008) . The reaction cycle is consistent with our steady-state kinetic data for mutants of Arg175, Lys158, Arg299, Lys292 and Phe300 as bicarbonate and Asc binding sites. We propose that Asc reduces ACCO/Fe(III)â•Oâ€“O to ACCO/Fe(III)=Oâ€“OH producing the ascorbate free radical. Ascorbate (or the ascorbate free radical) and bicarbonate in the outer sphere interact with ACCO/Fe(III)=O-OH at the rate-determining step E to F forming ACCO/Fe(IV)=O.  We propose that Asc (or ascorbate free radical, AFR) bound to Lys292, Lys158 and Phe300 activates the ACCO/Fe(III)â€“OOH/ACC/HCO 3  complex to ACCO/Fe(IV)=O)/ACC in cooperation with bicarbonate interacting with Lys158, Lys175 and Arg299 (SchemeÂ  1 D and E). Reaction site models ( Yoo  et al.  2006 ;  Brisson  et al.  2012 ) that place these residues in close proximity to the iron centre together with the results of site-directed mutagenesis studies ( Seo  et al.  2004 ;  Yoo  et al.  2006 ) and the results of studies reported herein provide chemical insights into how these amino acids bind and activate ACCO to produce ethylene.  Yoo  et al.  (2006)  found that Lys296 of apple ACCO is essential for activity, but our more limited studies show that Lys296Ala is slightly more active than the native ACCO.  ACC oxidase catalyses oxidation of amino acids other than ACC. It is a  d -amino acid oxidase and converts  d -valine to  iso -butanal ( Gibson  et al.  1998 ). Î±-Aminoisobutyric acid is also a substrate producing acetone, ammonia and CO 2  (but not cyanide) employing the same cofactors as ACCO with ACC as substrate ( Charng  et al.  1997 ). It is also a competitive inhibitor ( K  i  = 0.3 mM) with respect to ACC ( McGarvey and Christoffersen 1992) . When ACCO was incubated with cofactors AIB and cyanide and subsequently assayed with ACC as substrate, enzyme activity was retained/enhanced over the 2-h course of incubation while enzyme activity decreased without AIB/cyanide (Fig.Â  10 ). During the 2-h incubation with AIB/cyanide (while AIB was presumably oxidized to products), ACCO was not inactivated. This suggests that the presence of cyanide with substrate prevents inactivation and may improve catalytic competency of the Fe-centred reaction ( Ververidis and Dilley 1995 ). Bicarbonate also affords protection of ACCO from inactivation ( Barlow  et al.  1997 ;  Zhou  et al.  2002 ). When ACCO was pretreated with bicarbonate and subsequently assayed without supplemental bicarbonate, activity was comparable to that observed with supplemental bicarbonate (Fig.Â  3 ). The presence of cyanide as a ligand to ACCO/Fe(II) may assist ACC binding, as proposed for bicarbonate. ACCO/Fe(II) and ACCO/Fe(II)/HCO 3  âˆ’  are 6-coordinate and bicarbonate bound to Arg175 interacting with ACCO/Fe(II) would account for the NIR CD titration results of  Zhou  et al.  (2002 ). We propose that cyanide becomes an iron ligand during reaction turnover as shown in SchemeÂ  1 A. There is precedence for cyanide to become an iron ligand of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (PCD), which is also a non-haem (Fe(III)) enzyme ( Whittaker and Lipscomb 1984 ;  Orville  et al.  1997 ). However, ACCO is an Fe(II) enzyme but cyanide also binds to Fe(II). Cyanide readily displaces water as an iron ligand. In PCD, cyanide (as an oxygen surrogate) binds  trans  to a histidine ligand as an equatorial iron ligand. Substrate binding precludes cyanide binding. We propose that cyanide becomes an ACCO/Fe(II) ligand  trans  to His234 during completion of reaction turnover and thus precedes binding of the ACC substrate and oxygen (SchemeÂ  1 A). Under standard assay conditions, ACCO is activated by cyanide concentrations between 0.1 and 1 mM (Fig.Â  11 ). Moreover, these cyanide concentrations correspond to those generated during the 20-min enzyme assay at 20 Â°C (data not shown).  V  max  without supplemental cyanide is achieved after âˆ¼20 min as a consequence of cyanide accumulation during reaction turnover to âˆ¼150 ÂµM in the assay as calculated from the data in Fig.Â  3 . Beyond 1 mM, cyanide becomes inhibitory. Iron chelators such as EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline at concentrations well below 100 ÂµM strongly inhibit ACCO activity as a consequence of removing iron from the reaction centre (Fig.Â  12 ). Oxygen binds only to ACCO/Fe(II). Oxygen would readily displace cyanide as an Fe(II) ligand since the  K  m  for oxygen is âˆ¼28â€“67 ÂµM ( Thrower  et al.  2001 ;  Mirica and Klinman 2008 ). Alternatively, we propose that Asc may displace cyanide as an iron ligand as shown in SchemeÂ  1 B and C.  l -Ascorbic acid (as the ascorbate free radical AFR) may activate ACCO by interacting with the ternary complex ACCO/Fe(III)/ACC/OOH/HCO 3  since high Asc levels become inhibitory by interacting with the enzyme/substrate complex ( Segal 1993 ).  Cyanide derived as a product of the ACCO reaction may be sufficient to cause similar effects  in vivo  before the mitochondrial enzyme Î²-cyanoalanine synthase can detoxify it ( Peiser  et al.  1984 ). Other roles for ACCO-derived cyanide in plant metabolism have been found or implicated.  Grossman and Kwiatkowski (1995)  demonstrated that cyanide derived from ACC from herbicide-stimulated ACC synthase activity is a causative factor in the herbicidal effects observed in shoots of barnyard grass ( Echinochloa crus-galli ). Cyanide levels of 40 ÂµM were found in shoot tissues of quinclorac-treated plants, and cyanide is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome oxidase. Nearly four decades ago,  Solomos and Laties (1975)  observed that cyanide triggered ethylene production and induced the cyanide-insensitive respiratory pathway in potatoes. More than two decades ago,  Pirrung and Brauman (1987)  presented a hypothesis connecting ethylene and cyanide effects in plant physiology.  Bisson and Groth (2010)  found that cyanide (an ethylene agonist) increases the affinity of the ethylene receptors for EIN2. Cyanide, as a product of the ACCO reaction, may be involved in diverse metabolic pathways.  Numerous models of the ACCO reaction mechanism have been proposed ( Rocklin  et al.  1999 ,  2004 ;  Zhou  et al.  2002 ;  Solomon  et al.  2003 ;  Hausinger 2004 ;  Mirica and Klinman 2008 ). The model of  Mirica and Klinman (2008)  is most consistent with the available data as shown in SchemeÂ  1 . Their model considers ACC to bind to ACCO/Fe(II) like Î±-ketoglutarate (Î±KG) binds to other Î±KG-dependent non-haem iron enzymes. The study of  Ye  et al.  (2012)  provides an excellent analysis of the reaction mechanism of Î±KG-dependent enzymes. Models of the ACCO reaction centre presented by  Seo  et al.  (2004) ,  Yoo  et al.  (2006)  and  Brisson  et al.  (2012)  suggest specific amino acids as binding sites for ACC and bicarbonate and Asc cofactors that activate ACCO. We have modified the model of  Mirica and Klinman (2008)  to indicate the role of specific amino acid residues involved in binding of bicarbonate and Asc based on our site-directed mutagenesis studies and we have shown how some of these amino acids interact with the reaction centre from modelling studies. We also propose that cyanide becomes a ligand of ACCO/Fe(II) after reaction turnover (SchemeÂ  1 A). This model is in agreement with that of  Mirica and Klinman (2008)  and is supported by oxygen activation studies of non-haem iron complexes ( Lee  et al.  2010 ;  Ye  et al.  2012 ). ACC binding to ACCO precedes oxygen binding ( Thrower  et al.  2001 ). Spectroscopic studies ( Zhou  et al.  2002 ) reveal that when the ACCO/Fe(II)/ACC/HCO 3  complex is titrated with Asc it converts from a 6-coordinate (octahedral) to a 5-coordinate (square pyramidal) geometry, thereby providing the site for oxygen to bind. We propose that Asc may serve as an effector molecule displacing the cyanide ligand (SchemeÂ  1 B to C). This would account for the formation of the 5-coordinate geometry needed for oxygen to bind. When oxygen binds to this complex, it becomes 6-coordinate. Which leads to oxygen activation.  Tierney  et al.  (2005) , employing NO as a surrogate for oxygen, provided evidence that binding of ACC dictates the orientation of bound oxygen to be  trans  to one of the histidine ligands. This is consistent with the modelling studies conducted by  Brisson  et al.  (2012)  showing oxygen bound  trans  to His234. Ascorbate (by an outer sphere mechanism) reduces the ACCO/Fe(III)O=O/ACC/HCO 3  complex to the ACCO/Fe(III)=OOH/ACC/HCO 3  complex with formation of the AFR (SchemeÂ  1 D to E). Ascorbate provides the electron to form the intermediate ACCO/Fe(IV)   O/ACC/HCO 3  (SchemeÂ  1 E to F), which is the rate-limiting step ( Mirica and Klinman 2008 ). Density functional theory analysis of the ACCO reaction revealed the same rate-limiting step ( Bassan  et al.  2006 ). The AFR is relatively unreactive ( Bielski 1982 ). This may account for SchemeÂ  1 E to F to be the rate-limiting step in the reaction. Alternatively, two AFRs may disproportionately yield Asc and dehydroascorbate, which is the general fate of the AFR ( Bielski 1982 ). This would allow Asc rather than the AFR to be the reductant (SchemeÂ  1 E to F). The net result would be the same stoichiometrically, namely one Asc yielding one dehydroascorbate leading to the formation of the iron-oxo complex (SchemeÂ  1 F). The ironâ€“oxo intermediate (F) would abstract the H atoms from the ACC amino group and rapidly fragment into ethylene and cyanoformate as the ironâ€“oxo oxygen atom is reduced to water. Cyanoformate is unstable and breaks down to cyanide and CO 2  ( Peiser  et al.  1984 ). At the completion of reaction turnover, we propose that cyanide becomes an ACCO/Fe(II) ligand  trans  to the His234 ligand (or  trans  to His177) with two water molecules as ligands, as shown in SchemeÂ  1 A. Cyanide readily replaces water as an Fe(III) ligand as found for protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase ( Whittaker and Lipscomb 1984 ;  Orville  et al.  1997 ). However, ACCO is an Fe(II) enzyme. Cyanide can bind to both Fe(II) and Fe(III) ( Clay  et al . 2002 ;  Leavesley  et al.  2008 ). Cyanide is a stronger ligand to Fe(III) than to Fe(II), but if bound to Fe(III) this would limit the ability of Asc or the AFR to reduce oxygen ( Shearer  et al.  2003 ). Dioxygen binding to the complex ACCO/Fe(II)/ACC/Asc (without bicarbonate) results in rapid inactivation of ACCO ( Barlow  et al.  1997 ;  Zhou  et al.  2002 ). Inactivation of ACCO is largely spared in the presence of bicarbonate and/or cyanide ( Ververidis and Dilley 1995 ). This may promote a proton-coupled electron transfer ( Shook and Borovick 2010 ) from the ACC amino group leading to the abstraction of a hydrogen atom. If the AFR is the reductant, it would provide only the electron since it is not protonated (SchemeÂ  1 E and F). Moreover, the  18 O KIE decreases from 1.0215 Â± 0.0005 at a saturating Asc concentration (20 mM) to 1.0157 Â± 0.0004 at low Asc levels (2 mM). This observation together with the large     value suggests that the concentration of the AFR may be rate limiting. The role of bicarbonate would be to assist the formation of an intermediate complex (SchemeÂ  1 D to E) ACCO/Fe(III)â•Oâ•Oâ•H involving Asc as the reductant leading to formation of the first water. The large  18 O KIE value of 1.0215 Â± 0.0005 determined for ACCO is consistent with an outer sphere electron transfer lowering the Oâ•O bond order occurring at the rate-determining step ( Mirica and Klinman 2008 ). The unstable ironâ€“oxo intermediate (SchemeÂ  1 F) would break down to yield ethylene, CO 2 , HCN and H 2 O as Fe(IV) is reduced to Fe(II) with H atoms from the ACC amino group. Cyanide is a much stronger iron ligand than water particularly when positioned  trans  to a histidine imidazole nitrogen due to the strong  trans  effect of cyanide ( Basolo and Pearson 1967 ) and so may become an iron ligand as shown in SchemeÂ  1 A. The schemeÂ is generally consistent with the role of the amino acid residues shown clustered around the reaction site as bicarbonate and Asc binding sites as modelled by  Brisson  et al.  (2012)  and  Yoo  et al.  (2006)  and our steady-state kinetic analysis of ACCO mutants of many of the same residues ( Kadyrzhanova  et al.  1997 ,  1999 ;  Dilley  et al.  2001 ,  2003 ) and data presented herein.  ACC oxidase contains putative amino acid sequence motifs for post-translational modifications.  ACC oxidase becomes fragmented into polypeptides ranging in size from 8 to 26 kDa when assayed in the presence of oxygen, Fe(II) and Asc with or without ACC. Left lane, buffer only; middle lane, Fe(II) and Asc; right lane, Fe(II), Asc and ACC. The C-terminal 15-kDa fragment has the N-terminal sequence F187QDNKVS. The C-terminal 12-kDa fragment has the N-terminal sequence V215NLGD. All the other fragments have the same N-terminal sequence as intact ACCO. (Reprinted with permission from  Zhang  et al.  (1997) .

(From  Dilley  et al.  1995 .  Acta Horticulturae   379 :25â€“39, with permission from  Acta Horticulturae .)  Much insight has been gained about the ACCO reaction mechanism from X-ray crystallography structure interpretation, spectrophotometric studies, site-directed mutagenesis and steady-state kinetic investigations, DFT analyses and protein modelling studies. Collectively, these studies reveal the nature of the ACCO reaction site and how specific amino acid residues may participate in the catalytic reaction. So far, it appears that the â€˜active structureâ€™ of ACCO is formed when ACC becomes bound to the 2-Hisâ€“1-Asp Fe(II) site allowing the C-terminal Î±-helix 11 to fold into position near the Fe(II) site. This provides a â€˜nestâ€™ comprised of several positively charged amino acid residues from the C-terminal helix along with Lys199 from Î²-strand 7 and Lys158 from Î²-strand 5, which serve as binding sites via H-bonds and electrostatic interactions for Asc and bicarbonate to coordinately activate the ACCO reaction. Iron is the binding site for ACC and oxygen. The H-bonding and electrostatic binding sites for ACC, bicarbonate and Asc for  M. domestica  ACCO1 include Arg175, Arg244, Ser246, Lys158, Lys292, Arg299 and Phe300. Arg175 is the most important amino acid affecting ACCO activity. Its role may be structural or it may be a binding site for bicarbonate. Lys292 is the most important Asc binding site followed by Lys158. We propose that Asc may form a Schiff base with one of the two essential lysyl residues. This may serve in the non-redox role of Asc as the base catalyst to activate the reaction but not as the reductant to reduce oxygen. An Ascâ€“Lys Schiff base may play a role in protecting essential lysyl residues more generally in other proteins and enzymes from oxidative damage. Pyridoxal-5â€²-phosphate would readily replace Asc bound to a lysyl residue as a Schiff base. This concept is worthy of further study. A novel result of our investigation is that cyanide, a product of the ACCO reaction, may become a ligand of ACCO/Fe(II) at the completion of reaction turnover. We propose that cyanide becomes displaced when ACC, Asc and oxygen bind in sequence. Our finding that cyanide protects ACCO from inactivation and also activates the reaction warrants further investigation. Final proof of where and how ACC, Asc and bicarbonate bind to ACCO requires X-ray crystallography analyses of ACCO with substrates and cofactors included along with cyanide serving as an oxygen surrogate. An ACCO/Fe(II)/ACC/CN complex would lend itself to spectrophotometric studies. Such analyses may be possible by employing a closely similar but non-reactive substrate analogue as done by  Orville  et al.  (1997)  with PCD. Alternately, ACCO mutant Arg299Glu, which has no detectable activity, may be employed for X-ray crystallography analysis with substrates and cofactors. Our resource of ACCO mutant constructs to produce recombinant proteins can be made available to other investigators. We propose that ACCO may play other important roles in the ethylene signal transduction pathway not directly linked to the ACCO reaction. The ACCO protein appears to have post-translational activities including phosphokinase activity, proteinâ€“protein interaction capability, and cysteine protease and transpeptidase (peptide ligase) activities. ACC oxidase has significant homology with  L. esculentum  cysteine protease LeCp, which functions as a protease and, after post-translational processing, as a regulator of  Acs2  gene expression ( Matarasso  et al.  2005 ). ACC oxidase may play a similar role in signal transduction after post-translational processing.  In vitro  studies reveal that ACCO binds to and promotes phosphorylation of apple fruit proteins (of unknown nature) in a ripening-dependent manner. It also becomes autophosphorylated. ACC oxidase becomes inactivated by fragmentation ( Barlow  et al.  1997 ;  Zhang  et al.  1997 ) and has intrinsic protease and transpeptidase (ligase) activity. The post-translational activities of ACCO warrant further research.  The study was supported by the United States Department of Agriculture-National Research Initiatives Grant 9602627, National Science Foundation grant to Neogen Corporation, Lansing, Michigan, and the Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station.  Z.W. transformed the recombinant and native ACCO proteins in  E. coli , purified the enzymes and conducted the enzyme assays. D.K.K.-K. prepared ACCO mutants by site-directed mutagenesis. F.V. conducted enzyme purifications, lysine-specific reagent studies, enzyme assays and the cyanide activation studies. R.B. provided analytical assistance and data logistics for manuscript preparation. K.P. assisted in analysis of X-ray structure interpretation of ACCO mutants. D.R.D. designed the experiments, interpreted data and wrote the manuscript.  None declared.

The following  Supporting Information  is available in the online version of this article â€“   Supporting Information Fig.Â 1.  Sequence comparison of ACC oxidase (ACCO) from  Petunia hybrida  (PDB 1WA6), anthocyanin synthase (PDB 1GP6) and isopenicillin N synthase (PDB 1BK0). The three enzymes are members of the 2-Hisâ€“1-Asp non-haem iron enzymes. From:  Zhang  et al.  (2004) .  Chemistry and Biology  11:1383â€“1394 (with permission of  Chemistry and Biology ).   Supporting Information Fig.Â 2.  Lysine-specific reagent AMCA-sulfo-NHS inhibition up to a 2/1 mol/mol ratio indicates two essential lysine residues in ACCO. Purified recombinant ACCO (0.8 nmol) was treated with AMCA-sulfo-NHS for 10 min in MOPS buffer (pH 7.2) and the reaction was stopped with 50 ÂµM glycine. ACC oxidase assay cofactors were added and ACC was used to start the assay. Sulfo-NHS blocks the Îµ-amino of lysine.   Supporting Information Fig.Â 3.  Pyridoxal-5â€²-phosphate (PLP) competitively inhibits ACCO with respect to Asc. Double reciprocal plot of ACCO activity versus Asc concentration. One nmole of purified ACCO fusion protein was assayed with the standard assay with 0 ÂµM (circles), 100 ÂµM (squares), 200 ÂµM (triangles) and 300 ÂµM (diamonds) PLP with Asc varied.   Supporting Information Fig.Â 4.   d -Saccharic acid 1,4-lactone (a structural analogue of Asc) is a competitive inhibitor of ACCO with respect to Asc ( K  i  = 0.3 mM). It apparently binds to the high-affinity Asc binding site as shown by  Rocklin  et al.  (2004) . The purified ACCO fusion protein was assayed with the standard assay (see Methods) with 0 mM (circles), 0.5 mM (squares) and 1.5 mM  d -saccharic 1,4-lactone.   Supporting Information Fig.Â 5.  Double reciprocal plot of ACCO activity vs. Asc concentration with the indicated concentrations of 2,4-pteridinediol (lumazine) showing competitive activation of ACCO. The 2,4-pteridinediol  K  a  = 2.2 mM, which is similar to the Asc  K  a  of 2.58 mM. 2,4-Pteridinediol activates ACCO in the absence of Asc. Purified recombinant ACCO (1 nmol) was assayed with the standard assay.   Supporting Information Fig.Â 6.  2,4,5-Triamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine (TAP) inhibits ACCO competitively with respect to Asc. Purified recombinant ACCO (1 nmol) was assayed with the standard assay. Inhibition was not reversed at higher ferrous sulfate levels. 4,5,6-Triaminopyrimidine uncompetitively activates ACCO with respect to Asc (data not shown).
