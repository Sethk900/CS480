Age and Sex of Sage Grouse from WingsA technique is described for determining age and sex of sage grouse (Centrocercus uropha- sianus) from wings collected during August and September hunting seasons. Easily discernible pri- mary molt characteristics (retention of primaries 1 and 2 in juveniles and the difference in length of primaries 2 and 3 between adults and juveniles when primary 3 has not yet molted) have been com- bined with four basic wing measurements in an age and sex key. The relatively slow method of measuring primaries with a ruler is replaced by a measuring board with a backstop and three lines scribed across its face for use with the age and sex key. Wings are measured in a flat and straightened position from the skin-covered wrist joint to the tip of the desired primary and compared to the appropriate lines on the measuring board. Statistics estimating the probability of misclassification for each of the four measurement categories are given
