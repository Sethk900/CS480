Respiratory carbon use and carbon storage in mid-rotation loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantations: the effect of site resources on the stand carbon balance.We used estimates of autotrophic respiration (<em>R</em><sub>A</sub>), net primary productivity (NPP) and soil CO<sub>2</sub> evolution (<em>S</em><sub>ff</sub>), to develop component carbon budgets for 12-year-old loblolly pine plantations during the fifth year of a fertilization and irrigation experiment. Annual carbon use in <em>R</em><sub>A</sub> was 7.5, 9.0, 15.0, and 15.1 Mg C ha<sup>-;1</sup> in control (C), irrigated (I), fertilized (F) and irrigated and fertilized (IF) treatments, respectively. Foliage, fine root and perennial woody tissue (stem, branch, coarse and taproot) respiration accounted for, respectively, 37%, 24%, and 39% of <em>R</em><sub>A</sub> in C and I treatments and 38%, 12% and 50% of <em>R</em><sub>A</sub> in F and IF treatments. Annual gross primary production (GPP=NPP+<em>R</em><sub>A</sub>) ranged from 13.1 to 26.6 Mg C ha<sup>-;1</sup>. The I, F, and IF treatments resulted in a 21, 94, and 103% increase in GPP, respectively, compared to the C treatment. Despite large treatment differences in NPP, <em>R</em><sub>A</sub>, and carbon allocation, carbon use efficiency (CUE=NPP/GPP) averaged 0.42 and was unaffected by manipulating site resources.
