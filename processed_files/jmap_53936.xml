Potassium release in some saline soils of IsraelPotassium release from samples of two saline and three nonsaline soils was studied by measuring the amounts of the cation in 0.01 N CaCl2 and water extracts. The factors which affected the release were: the distribution of potassium between the silt and clay fractions, the total potassium content of the sample and its salinity. Soil samples with a distribution ratio above unity (i.e., with potassium mainly in the silt fraction) and a high total potassium content released K at a higher rate than those with a distribution ratio below unity and a high total potassium content. The effect of salinity was of minor importance in comparison with those of the two other factors.
