Basin-Scale Assessment of Operational Base Flow Separation MethodsAbstractBase flow recession analysis is required to estimate the long-term, reliable component of the hydrograph and water cycle, and for drought management, inflow design and analysis, and contaminant and nutrient transport. Operationally, recursive digital filtering (RDF) techniques are commonly applied; however, questions have been raised about the reliability and parameterization of these methods. A comparison of three base flow separation methods, including two popular RDFs and one hydrologic model, is performed in two base flow-dominant subbasins of the Grand River Basin in southern Ontario, Canada. The Eramosa River and Whiteman’s Creek subbasins are similar in size (236 and 383  km2, respectively) and have similar annual runoff distributions yet significantly different physiography governing runoff generation. Subbasin physiographic characteristics are found to result in significant differences in annual base flow distributions, which are well captured by the hydrologic model but not by the RDFs. Stable water isotopes (SWIs) are applied for verification of base flow separations using two-component mixing model separations and show better visual agreement with a base flow derived from the hydrologic model over the RDF methods. Limitations include insufficient isotope data to quantify a statistically significant model fit and results that are tied to subbasin physiography and basin-specific processes. Results support the application of SWIs for regional hydrograph separation and highlight the need for more efficient, yet physically based base flow separation in regions with complex physiography.
