Evaluating Hyperion capability for land cover mapping in a fragmented ecosystem: Pollino National Park, ItalyWe analyze the capability of Hyperion spaceborne hyperspectral data for discriminating land cover in a complex natural ecosystem according to the structure of the currently used European standard classification system (CORINE Land Cover 2000). For this purpose, we used Hyperion imagery acquired over Pollino National Park (Italy).Hyperion pre-processed data (30Â m spatial resolution) were classified at the pixel level using common parametric supervised classification methods. The algorithms' performance and class level accuracy were compared with those obtained for the same area using airborne hyperspectral MIVIS data (7Â m spatial resolution).Moreover, in selected test areas characterized by heterogeneous land cover (as mapped by MIVIS classification) a Linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU) technique was applied to Hyperion data to derive the abundance fractions of land cover endmembers. The accuracy of the LSU analysis was evaluated using the Residual Error parameter, by comparing Hyperion LSU results with land cover fractional abundances achieved from reference data (i.e., MIVIS and air-photo classification).The results show the potential of Hyperion spaceborne hyperspectral imagery in mapping land cover and vegetation diversity up to the 4th level of the CORINE legend, even at the sub-pixel level, within a fragmented ecosystem such as that of Pollino National Park. Moreover, we defined a criterion for evaluating the Hyperion accuracy in retrieving land cover abundances at the sub-pixel scale. Sub-pixel analysis allowed us to determine the optimal threshold to select the areas on which consistent fractional land cover monitoring can be achieved using the Hyperion sensor.
