New species of the genus Ortheziola Šulc (Hemiptera, Coccoidea, Ortheziidae)Abstract This paper describes three new Ortheziola species of the Palaearctic and Oriental regions. The specimens were extracted from forest litter using Berlese funnels, and are from the collections of Muséum d’Histoire naturelle de Genève, Switzerland. Thus the genus Ortheziola sensu stricto now includes 12 species. An identification key, distribution map and new locality records for the Ortheziola species currently known are provided.
