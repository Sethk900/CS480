Here, two Chilean small green coccoid referred as <italic>Chlorella</italic>-like strains were identified using a polyphasic approach. Only one of them corresponded to the genus <italic>Chlorella (C. vulgaris)</italic>; the other belonged to the recently amended genus <italic>Chloroidium (C. saccharophilum)</italic>. Lipids characterization of the biomass obtained from these strains showed that <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> (Baker strain) appeared to be suitable as raw material for biodiesel production, while <italic>Chloroidium saccharophilum</italic> (Coliumo strain) would be more appropriate for animal nutrition.The genus <italic>Chlorella</italic> was the first microalga to be massively cultured as food, feed and as a source of nutraceuticals. More recently, some species have been suggested as candidates for biodiesel production. One of the most difficult tasks in studying the systematics of green coccoids is the identification of species assigned to the genus <italic>Chlorella</italic>. In the context of several projects carried out by our research group we isolated two <italic>Chlorella</italic>-like strains from a marine and an estuarine coastal environment in Chile (Coliumo strain and Baker strain, respectively). The main objectives of this research were to identify these Chilean strainsâ€”at the species levelâ€”and determine and compare their lipid production when cultured under identical conditions. Cell size and shape, autospore number and sizes, and chloroplast and pyrenoid ultrastructure were considered as taxonomic descriptors, and 18S rDNA sequences and internal transcribed spacer ITS-1 + ITS-2 sequences and secondary structure were adopted as phylogenetic tools. The combined use of these morphological, ultrastructural and molecular attributes revealed that only the Baker strain belongs to the genus <italic>Chlorella</italic> (<italic>C. vulgaris</italic>), while the Coliumo strain corresponds to the recently amended genus <italic>Chloroidium</italic> (<italic>C. saccharophilum</italic>)<italic>.</italic> Lipid characterization of the biomass obtained from these strains showed that <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> (Baker strain) appears to be suitable as a raw material for biodiesel production, while <italic>Chloroidium saccharophilum</italic> (Coliumo strain) would be more appropriate for animal nutrition.Green algae represent one of the main taxonomic groups from which oleaginous strains have been identified. Two main applications of lipid-rich strains have been proposed: as raw material for biodiesel production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C20">Hu <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C9">Converti <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C42">Rodolfi <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C31">Lu <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>) and as essential fatty acid sources for animal and human nutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C43">Spolaore <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>).The genus <italic>Chlorella</italic> encompasses spherical or ellipsoidal non-motile green cells that produce autospores, and inhabit freshwater, soil and marine habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C27">KÃ³marek and Fott 1983</xref>).

More recently, and based mostly on molecular data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C39">PrÃ¶schold <italic>et al</italic>. (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C5">Bock <italic>et al</italic>. (2011)</xref> increased the species number of the â€˜true <italic>Chlorella</italic>â€™ to 14.In the context of several projects carried out by our research group (FICOLAB, <uri xlink:href="www.ficolab.cl" xlink:type="simple">www.ficolab.cl</uri>), we isolated two <italic>Chlorella</italic>-like strains, which are currently maintained and incorporated into the Culture Collection of Microalgae of the Universidad de ConcepciÃ³n, Chile (CCM-UDEC). In 2005, we isolated a green coccoid strain from a phytoplankton sample originating from Chilean coastal water, close to a natural population of the clam digger, <italic>Ensis macha</italic> (Coliumo Bay, BÃ­o-BÃ­o Region). More recently, in 2008, we isolated another strain, with similar morphological attributes under the light microscope, from the Baker River estuary, AysÃ©n Region, a characteristic turquoise-blue coloured river of Chilean Patagonia.The aims of this research were (i) to identify taxonomically, at the species level, the Coliumo and Baker strains by means of ultrastructure and molecular attributes and (ii) to determine and compare the growth parameters and lipid production of both strains, grown under identical culture conditions.The strains were collected from either coastal marine or estuarine water using 33-Âµm-diameter nylon mesh. The marine strain (here, the Coliumo strain) was collected at a depth of ca. 10 m in April 2005, close to a natural population of the clam digger <italic>E. macha</italic>, located in Coliumo Bay (36Â° 32â€²S; 72Â°57â€²W). The estuarine strain (here, the Baker strain) was collected in September 2008, from the estuary of the Baker River (47Â°47â€²43â€³S; 73Â°34â€²57â€³W) in the AysÃ©n Region, Southern Chile.Unialgal cultures of the strains under study were obtained by micropipetting and/or streaking across agar plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C19">Hoshaw and Rosowski 1973</xref>), inoculated in tubes with f/2 medium and successively transferred to and maintained in Walne medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C1">Andersen 2005</xref>). Under the latter medium, the strains have been maintained at a photon flux density (PFD) of 15â€“20 Âµmol m<sup>âˆ’2</sup> s<sup>âˆ’1</sup>, a temperature of 15 Â± 2 Â°C and a photoperiod of 16 : 8 h (light : dark). Both strains were incorporated into the Culture Collection of Microalgae of the Universidad de ConcepciÃ³n, ConcepciÃ³n, Chile (CCM-UDEC): the Coliumo strain as CCM-UDEC 143 and the Baker strain as CCM-UDEC 221.Live cells were examined under an Olympus CX31 microscope fitted with bright-field and phase-contrast optics. The photomicrographs were taken with an Olympus C3040 camera attached to the microscope.For transmission electron microscopy (TEM), culture material of the Coliumo strain was prepared following the protocol of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C35">Moestrup and Throndsen (1988)</xref>. Basically, the cells were harvested with gentle centrifugation and fixed for 1 h in an equal volume of 2 % glutaraldehyde and 0.1 M buffer cacodylate at neutral pH. In order to reduce the osmotic changes, 0.2 M sucrose was added. After washing the samples three times with decreasing sucrose concentrations (0.2, 0.1 and 0.05 M) for 2 h, the cells were treated for 3 h in a mix of 2 % osmium acid and 0.1 M buffer cacodylate, followed by a wash in sacarose buffer and dehydrated in a series of ethanol concentrations (30, 50, 70 %, and twice in absolute ethanol) for 15 min each, then transferred to propylene oxide for 5 min and kept overnight in a mix of 1 : 1 propylene oxide and Spurr. Finally, the samples were polymerized in Spurr at 60 Â°C. For the Baker strain, the protocol described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C40">Rascio <italic>et al</italic>. (1980)</xref> was used, since no good results were obtained with the above-described methodology. Ultrathin sections were obtained on a Sorvall MT 5000 (Du Pont) ultramicrotome, collected on slot grids and double-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C41">Reynolds 1963</xref>). Observations were carried out with a JEOL JEM 1200EX-II transmission electron microscope.

The purified fragments were cloned utilizing the PGEM-T Easy Vector kit (Promega). Plasmids with the cloned sequences were sent to Macrogen (Korea) for automated sequencing.Genomic DNA was extracted using the Dneasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) following the instructions provided by the manufacturers. The SSU and ITS rDNA were amplified according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C32">Luo <italic>et al</italic>. (2006)</xref> using the Taq PCR Mastermix Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) with the primers (EAF3: 5â€²-TCGACAATCTGGTTGATCCTGCCAG-3â€² and ITS055R: 5â€²-CTCCTTGGTCCGTGTTTCAAGACGGG-3) published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C38">PrÃ¶schold <italic>et al.</italic> (2001)</xref> using the following PCR cycle programme: 96 Â°C for 5 min, 30 cycles (96 Â°C for 1 min, 55 Â°C for 2 min and 68 Â°C for 3 min) and 68 Â°C for 10 min.The SSU rDNA sequences of both strains were incorporated into an alignment of all representatives of the Trebouxiophyceae and aligned according to their secondary structures. As a template, the secondary structure of CCAP 248/5 <italic>Micractinium pusillum</italic> was used (see fig. S1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C32">Luo <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>). This data set (36 taxa, 1747 bp) was analysed by PAUP v 4.0b10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C45">Swofford 2002</xref>). To test which evolutionary model fitted best for the phylogenetic analyses, the log-likelihood values of 56 models were estimated by PAUP, and the best model was calculated by Modeltest 3.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C37">Posada and Crandall 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C36">Posada and Buckley 2004</xref>) using the Akaike information criterion. The phylogenetic tree was inferred by maximum likelihood (ML) using PAUP and TIM+I+G model, which was estimated by Modeltest as the best model. To test the robustness of the phylogenetic tree, bootstrap analyses [neighbour-joining using the TIM+I+G model (1000 replicates), maximum parsimony (1000 replicates) and ML using the TIM+I+G model (100 replicates)] were conducted. The secondary structures of both ITS-1 and ITS-2 strains were performed using mfold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C50">Zuker 2003</xref>) and illustrated by the program LoopDloop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C14">Gilbert 1992</xref>).The strains were grown in 1 L of Walne medium at 20 Â± 2 Â°C, salinity of 35 psu, 200 Âµmol m<sup>âˆ’2</sup> s<sup>âˆ’1</sup> PFD and 16 : 8 h (L : D) photoperiod. The cultures were continuously aerated with 0.22 Âµm pore-filtered air. All cultures were initiated by the inoculation of each flask with exponentially growing cells (previously acclimated to the experimental conditions for 15 days) at a density of 10 000 cells mL<sup>âˆ’1</sup>. Four replicates of each strain were established.Growth was monitored over 17 days by cell counting in a NeubaÃ¼er chamber every other day. The maximum growth rate, <italic>k</italic><sub>max</sub> (divisions day<sup>âˆ’1</sup>), was determined during the logarithmic growth phase as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C49">Guillard (1973)</xref>. At Day 17, the cell density was also assessed to estimate the total lipids per cell.The algal dry weight was determined after 17 days of cultivation by filtering 10-mL aliquots through pre-dried and weighed Millipore filters of 0.45 Âµm pore size, washing the filtered aliquots with 0.5 M ammonium formiate and drying them at 80 Â°C until they reached a constant weight.Biomass from each replicate and strain was harvested by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 5 min at 4 Â°C and dried at 37 Â°C for 2 weeks. Thirty milligrams of dried biomass were used to determine the total lipid content according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C4">Bligh and Dyer (1959)</xref> and then quantified by the charring method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C33">Marsh and Weinstein, 1966</xref>). Total lipids were expressed per biomass dry weight, per culture volume and per cell.A sample of 30â€“35 mg of dry biomass was extracted with 3.75 mL of chloroform : methanol (1 : 2). After a 20 min homogenization by vortexing, 1.25 mL of distilled water and 1.25 mL of chloroform were added. The chloroformic phase (containing lipids) was evaporated and dried under nitrogen. The extract was derivatized with 1.3 mL of 14 % boron trifluoride in methanol, incubated at 90 Â°C for 3 min and then 2 mL of hexane and 1 mL of distilled water were added. Samples were shaken and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The organic phase was removed and evaporated under nitrogen. The extract was dissolved in 100 ÂµL of hexane, and 2 ÂµL of the dissolved extract were injected into a gas chromatograph (Claurus 600, Perkin Elmer) equipped with a SPB-PUFA column and an FID detector operated at 260 Â°C. A programme of 160â€“210 Â°C for 90 min was used. The peaks obtained were identified by comparing their retention times with those of a mix of standard fatty acids (â€˜PUFA-1, Marine Sourceâ€™, Supelco, Cat. 47033) and individual standards of arachidonic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, linolenic acid and gamma-linolenic acid (Sigma Aldrich). Relative quantification was performed by estimating the area of each peak with respect to the sum of the total areas of all peaks.Light micrographs of the Coliumo strain, showing the morphology of vegetative cells (A, C and F) and sporangium (D and F, arrow).

The phylogenetic tree (unrooted: midpoint rooting) shown was inferred by the maximum likelihood method based on a data set of 1747 aligned positions of 36 taxa using PAUP 4.0b10. For the analysis, the TIM model (base frequencies: A = 0.2467; C = 0.2259; G = 0.2794; T = 0.2480; rate matrix: Aâ€“C = 1.0000; Aâ€“G = 2.5989; Aâ€“T = 1.2872; Câ€“G = 1.2872; Câ€“T = 6.7566; Gâ€“T = 1.0000) with the proportion of invariable sites (<italic>I</italic> = 0.6138) and gamma distribution shape parameter (<italic>G</italic> = 0.5850) was chosen, which was calculated as the best model by Modeltest.

According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C46">Takeda (1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C47">1993</xref>), there are differences among these four species in cell wall characteristics [ruthenium red stainability (plus or minus) and anisotropy (plus or minus)]. Considering that the Baker strain under study was not subjected to cell wall characterization, and since <italic>C. vulgaris</italic> and <italic>C. lobophora</italic> shared these two attributes (rutheniun red: plus; anisotropy: minus), its identification as <italic>C. vulgaris</italic> was sustained on molecular data. Even though the 18S rDNA gene in the Baker strain has two introns which are missing in the authentic <italic>C. vulgaris</italic> species, the closely similar sequences in the ITS-1 and ITS-2 region confirmed its <italic>C. vulgaris</italic> identity. On the other hand, the Coliumo strain, and based also on pyrenoid ultrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C23">Ikeda and Takeda 1995</xref>), corresponds to the <italic>Chlorella</italic> species which belong to the glucan-type group, and specifically to <italic>C. saccharophila</italic>. The pyrenoid in the Coliumo strain is almost identical to the pyrenoid of <italic>C. saccharophila</italic> SAG 211-9a (fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLT020F4">4</xref> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C23">Ikeda and Takeda 1995</xref>). These features include the lack of a starch sheath around the pyrenoid that is surrounded by thylakoids. Many of the undulating single thylakoids penetrate the matrix of the pyrenoid which is usually surrounded by a series of more or less electrodense osmiophilic globules (=pyrenoglobuli) (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLT020F2">2</xref>A, C and D). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C11">Darienko <italic>et al</italic>. (2010)</xref> transferred all the <italic>Chlorella</italic>-like strains related to <italic>C. saccharophila</italic> to the genus <italic>Chloroidium</italic> Nadson and amended its identification by utilizing strain SAG 211-9a as the authentic strain of the type species, <italic>Chloroidium saccharophilum</italic> (KrÃ¼ger) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C11">Darienko <italic>et al</italic>. (2010)</xref>. Another attribute in common with <italic>C. saccharophila</italic> 211-9a (now <italic>Chloroidium saccharophilum</italic>) is the unequal size of the autospores during sporogenesis (see Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLT020F1">1</xref>F). The molecular data confirmed the identity of the Coliumo strain as <italic>Chloroidium saccharophilum</italic> based on 18S rDNA and ITS-1 and ITS-2 sequence similarities.Differences detected in growth parameters and the quantity and quality of lipids of both strains (TablesÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLT020TB1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLT020TB2">2</xref>) can be explained by the taxonomic distance between both strains, which belong to different genera, as was determined in this research.The value of the parameters â€˜total lipid content per dry biomassâ€™ and â€˜total lipids per culture volumeâ€™ depends on the applications to which the microalgal biomass will be destined. A biomass with a high total lipid content per dry biomass is preferred if lipids need to be extracted because fewer purification steps are needed from a lipid-rich biomass. On the other hand, if crude biomass can be used directly as the lipid source, total lipids per culture volume is a more important parameter to consider at the commercial level due to the high costs associated with the harvesting process from diluted cultures. In this work, the Baker strain was the most oleaginous when expressed as both parameters (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLT020TB1">1</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C17">Griffiths and Harrison (2009)</xref> summarized the published information on lipid productivity for biodiesel production of many microalgal species, including <italic>C. vulgaris</italic>. From the literature, this species exhibited an average of 25 % lipids per dry weight and a lipid productivity of 26 mg L<sup>âˆ’1</sup> day<sup>âˆ’1</sup> under nutrient-replete conditions (considered non-inductive for neutral lipid accumulation, the type preferred for biodiesel production). The strain of <italic>C. vulgaris</italic> included in this research (Baker strain) had 26 % lipids per dry weight and a lipid productivity of 33 mg L<sup>âˆ’1</sup> day<sup>âˆ’1</sup>, which fits well with the published values.On the other hand, the strain of <italic>Chloroidium saccharophilum</italic> (Coliumo strain) was less oleaginous, but accumulated the nutritionally valuable omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ALA (18 : 3 n-3). Alpha linolenic acid is the only omega-3 fatty acid considered to be essential for animals; its health benefits include cardioprotective effects, modulation of the inflammatory response and positive effects on central nervous system function, although these properties have been frequently overlooked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT020C44">Stark <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). Unfortunately, there is no published information about the biochemical composition of <italic>C. saccharophilum</italic> to contrast our results; however, the quantity and quality of lipids accumulated by this species make it a good candidate for animal nutrition.According to the results obtained in this work, <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> (Baker strain) would be appropriate as a raw material for biodiesel production, while <italic>Chloroidium saccharophilum</italic> (Coliumo strain) would be more appropriate for animal nutrition. Nevertheless, it is important to consider that, in this research, no optimization of culture conditions was performed for any of the strains, which could significantly (and differentially) increase the productivity of total lipids and improve their quality for fuel production and/or animal nutrition.The use of ultrastructural characters (i.e. pyrenoid, location of starch grains and thylakoids) together with molecular data (ITS-2 secondary structure and phylogeny based on 18S rDNA sequences) allowed the identification, at genus and species level, of the two <italic>Chlorella</italic>-like strains under study: <italic>Chloroidium sacharophyllum</italic> (Coliumo strain) and <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> (Baker strain).<italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> (Baker strain) appeared to be suitable as a raw material for biodiesel production, while <italic>Chloroidium saccharophilum</italic> (Coliumo strain) would be more appropriate for animal nutrition. However, in this research, no optimization of culture conditions was performed for any of the strains, which could significantly (and differentially) increase the productivity of total lipids and improve their quality for fuel production and/or animal nutrition. Research is now in progress to test both strains under lipid-inductive laboratory conditions.The sequences were deposited in GenBank.Submission # 1600175: 18S rRNA gene (partial), ITS-1, 5.8S rRNA gene and ITS-2 sequences of the <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> strain (Baker strain).Submission # 1600176: 18S rRNA gene (partial), ITS-1, 5.8S rRNA gene and ITS-2 sequences of the <italic>Chloroidium saccharophilum</italic> (Coliumo strain).This work was funded by <grant-sponsor xlink:type="simple">â€˜Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo CientÃ­fico y TecnolÃ³gicoâ€™ (FONDEF)</grant-sponsor> Projects <grant-num xlink:type="simple"># D07I-1063</grant-num> and <grant-num xlink:type="simple"># D07I-1017</grant-num>.M.A.G. was in charge in of obtaining the electron microscopy data in collaboration with Y.P. and P.A., and drafted the manuscript.
