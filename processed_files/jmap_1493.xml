Possible Mechanism for Spontaneous Establishment of Calluna vulgaris in a Recently Abandoned Agricultural Field.In Western Europe, arable lands have been abandoned to increase the area of nature, such as <em>Calluna vulgaris</em>-dominated heathlands. However, the growth conditions, e.g., nutrient availability and lack of a phenolics-rich organic layer, on ex-arable sandy soils differ markedly from those of heathland and will favor fast-growing plant species. Succession toward <em>Calluna</em>-dominated heathland is expected to take decades unless intensive restoration management is applied. Here, we report a possible mechanism to explain the occurrence of <em>Calluna </em>patches (0.7-2.0 m diameter) in a 10-year abandoned agricultural field within a dominant vegetation of grasses and forbs. All roots sampled from the <em>Calluna </em>patches were colonized by ericoid mycorrhizal (ERM) and other endomycorrhizal fungi. Both nitrogen mineralization of soil organic N and potential nitrogen mineralization (arginine ammonification) were much lower in soil under <em>Calluna </em>patches than in the rest of the ex-arable soil, although other soil characteristics did not differ. The nitrogen to phosphorus ratio in <em>Calluna </em>shoots was much greater than that in shoots of grasses and forbs, indicating that the latter were more N limited. The results indicate that the association with ERM fungi is probably providing the host competitive superiority for nitrogen even in a soil with low organic matter content. Our results suggest that the conversion from arable land into heathland may be accomplished by the immediate establishment of <em>Calluna </em>seedlings and ERM inoculum when agricultural activities are stopped. This needs to be tested in controlled experiments.
