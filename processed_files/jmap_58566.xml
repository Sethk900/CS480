Turbulence and Suspended Sediment Measurements in an Urban Environment during the Brisbane River Flood of January 2011AbstractIn urbanized areas, flood flows constitute a hazard to populations and infrastructure, as illustrated during major floods in 2011. During the 2011 Brisbane River flood, some turbulent velocity data were collected using acoustic Doppler velocimetry in an inundated street. The field deployment showed some unusual features of flood flow in the urban environment. That is, the water elevations and velocities fluctuated with distinctive periods between 50 and 100Â s linked with some local topographic effects. The instantaneous velocity data were analyzed using a triple decomposition. The velocity fluctuations included a large energy component in the slow fluctuation range, whereas the turbulent motion components were much smaller. The suspended sediment data showed some significant longitudinal flux. Altogether, the results highlighted that the triple decomposition approach originally developed for periodic flows is well-suited to complicated flows in an inundated urban environment.
