Co-existence of myxomycetes and beetles in an Atlantic Rainforest remnant of Pernambuco, Brazil, with emphasis on staphylinids (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae)The relationship between myxomycetes and insects was investigated in a fragment of the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest located in the city of Recife, Pernambuco, north-eastern Brazil. Sixteen excursions into the Dois Irmãos State Ecological Reserve (7°55′43′′ to 8°09′17′′ S, 34°52′05′′ to 35°00′59′′ W, 387.4 ha) were carried out during different seasons between August 2005 and August 2007 for observations and collections of myxomycetes and insects on decomposing trunks and leaf litter. A total of 196 specimens of myxomycetes was obtained, representing 31 species, 16 genera and six families. Baeocera sp. (Coleoptera, Staphylinidae) individuals predominated (86%) in the sample, found on the sporocarps of four species of Trichiales (Arcyria cinerea, Arcyria denudata, Hemitrichia calyculata, Hemitrichia serpula) and two species of Liceales (Lycogala epidendrum, Tubulifera microsperma). No preference was observed for type of sporocarp. No seasonal influence was found for the establishment of these associations, recorded for the first time in this forest environment.
