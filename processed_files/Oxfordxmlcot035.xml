We discuss the questions that have already been addressed with these methods, the advantages and disadvantages of them, and the demographic knowledge that can be derived for marine megafauna using hormone determination.Sex, age and sexual maturation are key biological parameters for aspects of life history and are fundamental information for assessing demographic changes and the reproductive viability and performance of natural populations under exploitation pressures or in response to environmental influences. Much of the information available on the reproductive condition, length at sexual maturity and sex determinations of endangered species has been derived from direct examination of the gonads in dead animals, either intentionally or incidentally caught, or from stranded individuals. However, morphological data, when used alone, do not provide accurate demographic information in sexually monomorphic marine vertebrate species (e.g. sharks, sea turtles, seabirds and cetaceans). Hormone determination is an accurate and non-destructive method that provides indirect information about sex, reproductive condition and sexual maturity of free-ranging individuals. Correlations between sex steroid concentrations and biochemical parameters, gonadal development and state, reproductive behaviour and secondary external features have been already demonstrated in many species. Different non-lethal approaches (e.g. surgical and markâ€“recapture procedures), with intrinsic advantages and disadvantages when applied on free-ranging organisms, have been proposed to asses sex, growth and reproductive condition. Hormone determination from blood samples will generate valuable additional demographic information needed for stock assessment and biological conservation.Biological parameters describing key aspects of life history, such as sex, age structure, the dynamics of growth and sexual maturation (recruitment for breeding), are generally considered fundamental information for assessing demographic changes, reproductive viability and the performance of natural populations under exploitation pressures or in response to environmental influences, for establishing the accurate conservation status of free-ranging populations and for developing conservation and sustainable fisheries management strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C51">DeMaster, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C149">Perrin and Reilly, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C56">Eberhardt, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C8">Balazs, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C47">Crouse and Frazer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C72">Haddon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C82">Heppell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C52">de Mitcheson, 2009</xref>; alternative approaches are described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C103">Kirkwood, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C40">Cook, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C153">Punt and Donovan, 2007</xref>). However, certain basic information needed to predict the population dynamics of threatened species is particularly difficult to obtain solely by visual determination. This is especially true for sexually monomorphic marine vertebrate wildlife (e.g. sharks, seabirds, cetaceans and sea turtles; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C28">Caldwell, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C12">Bercovitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C145">Owens <italic>et al.</italic>, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C131">Merchant-Larios, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C195">Wibbels <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C13">Bertellotti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C33">Casale <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C54">Dubiec and Zagalaska-Neubauer, 2006</xref>).

Even when data can be obtained directly from free-ranging animals by photo-identification or tagging studies, the population estimates for wild marine fauna are complicated by the difficulties of capturing and tagging, the effects of tagging, the recovery rate and the requirement for long-term monitoring series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C61">Gibbons, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C39">Clapham, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C117">Limpus, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C8">Balazs, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C9">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C11">Balazs and Chaloupka, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C55">Dugger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).Measurement of hormone concentrations provides an alternative methodology that can be used for understanding physiological cycles, functional aspects of reproductive endocrinology and the relationship between the hormone dynamics and the reproductive and nesting behaviour (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C114">Licht <italic>et al.</italic>, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C115">1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C116">1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C142">Owens, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C113">Licht, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C144">Owens and Morris, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C192">Wibbels <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C193">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C196">Williams, 1992a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C3">Al-Habsi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C7">Awruch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008b</xref>).

We give particular attention to those long-lived, monomorphic marine species in which sex and maturity are impossible to assess by non-lethal, visual/external examinations. We discuss the questions that have already been addressed and the demographic knowledge derived from analytical determination of hormone concentrations in marine megafauna. We briefly review the more invasive techniques and procedures that have generated demographic data and population parameters in marine vertebrates, specifically those focused on establishing sex and reproductive status.

Thus, despite some limitations, steroid hormones [particularly testosterone (T), progesterone (P) and E], measured in non-lethal samples (e.g. blood, amniotic fluid, eggs, blubber, faeces and saliva), have been proposed as an alternative tool for the assessment of sex identification, the reproductive status (gonadal activity and pregnancy), stage of maturity and size at maturity of wild threatened and endangered species. However, until the analytical process is well established and the natural variations and functional differences (e.g. season and sex) of hormone concentrations are well understood for the population of interest, some validating technique (histology, laparoscopy, ultrasound or photo-identification) has to be applied to a small subset of the sampled organisms of known sex or reproductive condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C190">Wibbels <italic>et al.</italic>, 1987a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C195">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C68">Gross <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C188">Wibbels, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C189">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C160">Rolland <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C24">Braun-McNeill <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C18">Blanvillain <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C100">Kellar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C182">Sulikowski <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).

The accuracy of T levels in plasma, when used as a sexing method in immature loggerheads, decreased by 67% from summer to winter due to the overlapping values between females and males observed during the non-breeding period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C24">Braun-McNeill <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). For that reason, for sexual determination it is recommended to use those blood samples taken during the summer, when the elevated values of T are found in loggerheads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C24">Braun-McNeill <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C18">Blanvillain <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).The evaluation of circulating hormone concentrations has helped in the identification of the environmental (e.g. photoperiod) and energetic cues (e.g. body condition and lipid reserves) that stimulate gonadal development, migration, nesting behaviour and reproduction in seabirds (both sexes) and sea turtles (females). The E concentration is closely related to the maturation of the ovarian follicles and vitellogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C67">Groscolas <italic>et al.</italic>, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C81">Hector <italic>et al.</italic>, 1986b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C76">Hamann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). The elevated levels of plasma steroids (E and T) and triglycerides and the increase in follicular and testicular size observed before migration, courtship and the pre-laying period in sea turtles and seabirds all suggest that resource allocation (metabolic preparation), follicular development and elevated activity of the gonads occur before arrival at the breeding grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C67">Groscolas <italic>et al.</italic>, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C81">Hector <italic>et al.</italic>, 1986b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C74">Hamann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C75">2002b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C76">2003</xref>).In AdÃ©lie (<italic>Pygoscelis adeliae</italic>) and Emperor penguins (<italic>Aptenodytes forsteri</italic>), the increase in plasma T concentration observed in males at the time of copulation has been related to the period of testicular development and spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C67">Groscolas <italic>et al.</italic>, 1986</xref>). In male and female black-browed (<italic>Diomedea melanophris</italic>), grey-headed (<italic>D. chrysostoma</italic>) and wandering albatross (<italic>D. exulans</italic>), the highest levels of sex steroids in plasma can be found during the pre-laying period. In these species of seabirds, sexual differences in the dynamics of circulating P concentration can be found during the breeding cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C80">Hector <italic>et al.</italic>, 1986a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C81">b</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C197">Williams (1992b)</xref> explained deferred sexual maturity in Macaroni (<italic>Eudyptes chrysolophus</italic>) and Gentoo penguins (<italic>Pygoscelis papua</italic>) by variation of the plasma steroids, and concluded that delays in breeding should be related to behavioural or ecological factors instead of an immature physiological state, because late breeder male and female penguins were physiologically mature at 5â€…years and 1â€…year, respectively, prior to their first breeding event. Immature wandering albatross, which also exhibit deferred sexual maturity, have shown a significant increase in testicular size and plasma T concentration with age; even when no differences in the size of the gonads were found, immature individuals that had not yet bred, older than 5â€…years, showed lower concentrations of T than breeders.

The concentration of T in serum has been used to describe the maturity condition (immature, pubescent and fully mature) and age at maturity of a captive finless porpoise male, in which the pattern of growth in body length coincided with the pattern of increase of the concentration of serum T measured in the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C49">Daoquan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Blubber concentrations of T have been compared between stages of maturity in common dolphins; the highest T concentrations occur in mature dolphins, compared with pubertal and immature individuals. The concentration of T measured in adipose tissue biopsies taken from free-swimming common dolphins have not shown significant differences when compared with values measured in stranded and incidentally captured individuals of known stages of maturity. This suggests the utility of blubber T concentration to assess maturity condition in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C100">Kellar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In the North Atlantic right whale (<italic>E. glacialis</italic>), the faecal ratio of androgen to estrogen concentration is an accurate approach for sex determination; this has been validated with photo-identified individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C160">Rolland <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Faecal hormone concentrations have been suggested as an additional tool for assessing sexual maturity and reproductive state in free-ranging right whales. The concentration of faecal T showed significant differences between males when grouped according to maturity status (immature vs. adult). Pregnant and lactating right whale females were also identifiable from other female maturity subgroups (juvenile or resting adult) according to specific faecal hormone profile characteristics (concentrations of progestins, estrogens and androgens; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C160">Rolland <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). The lack of correlation between the weight of the faecal sample taken and the hormone concentrations measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C160">Rolland <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) guarantees the accuracy when using this approach in cetaceans. We lack additional information on sex hormone concentrations in marine mammals because of the difficulties inherent in obtaining blood or faecal samples in free-living cetaceans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C49">Daoquan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C161">Rolland <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C100">Kellar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).Circulating hormone determination in endangered wildlife has additional benefits. In the field, the capture and handling protocol is limited to blood sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C188">Wibbels, 1999</xref>), which can be completed in &lt;15â€…min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C92">Jessop <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C93">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C96">2004c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C18">Blanvillain <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), thus facilitating the collection of a large number of samples with minimal stress to the individuals. Sex steroids are fairly stable metabolites, so serum samples can be stored frozen (âˆ’20Â°C) for long periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C188">Wibbels, 1999</xref>) without using a large amount of laboratory space. The analytical procedures used to determine the hormone concentrations (radioimmunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) are relatively inexpensive, large numbers of samples can be analysed simultaneously in a short period of time, and the analytical protocols have been extensively described for many marine species. Thus, hormone determination is a practical and inexpensive means for evaluating the demographic data of large numbers of individuals. The type of sample should be chosen according to the species of interest, thus facilitating the field work (e.g. blubber or faecal samples in cetaceans; amniotic fluid in hatchlings). This technique could be assessed for younger and immature individuals, such as calves, chicks and hatchlings; in the case of immature sea turtles, it could be used in individuals as short as 25â€…cm of straight carapace length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C188">Wibbels, 1999</xref>).Classical, direct approaches for population parameter assessment employed for marine megafaunaMarkâ€“recapture and sequential measurements of the same individuals at time intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C72">Haddon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C52">de Mitcheson, 2009</xref>) and photo-identification, based on a photographic catalogue and recognition of variations of the dorsal fin and fluke patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C99">Karczmarski and Cockcroft, 1998</xref>), are the most commonly used methods for the determination of many important life history and demographic data, in both captive and live free-ranging organisms (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COT035TB1">1</xref>). Photo-identification has been used as a gold standard approach to validate the conclusions based on hormone concentrations measured in cetaceans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C160">Rolland <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Studying the relationship between the reproductive endocrinology and the reproductive breeding ecology has been favoured by tagging methods in seabirds such as penguins and albatrosses (e.g. AdÃ©lie penguin and Emperor penguin), in which the identification and monitoring of specific individual behaviours (e.g. copulatory position, arrival date at breeding colony, vocalizations, incubation and attendance patterns) and breeding conditions (e.g. incubation, moulting and reproductive success) could be used as indirect approaches to determine classification criteria, such as sex determination (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C67">Groscolas <italic>et al.</italic>, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C80">Hector <italic>et al.</italic>, 1986a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C81">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C196">Williams, 1992a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C38">Cherel <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C128">Mauget <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>). The monitoring of specific individual behaviours is facilitated by the large number of organisms in a colony, the accessibility to observe marked individuals in their habitat (ice-free and open areas), their large size, flightlessness and site philopatry (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C1">Ainley and DeMaster, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C2">Ainley <italic>et al.</italic>, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C67">Groscolas <italic>et al.</italic>, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C20">Boersma <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C48">Dann and Cullen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C50">Darby and Seddon, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C45">Crawford <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C55">Dugger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).

These findings lead to a variety of integrative and comparative reviews about the reproductive biology and endocrinology (hormone dynamics) of some species (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C111">Licht, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C113">1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C142">Owens, 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C141">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C144">Owens and Morris, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C29">Callard <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C183">Valencia and Leyton, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C76">Hamann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Nevertheless, some aspects of the reproductive endocrinology and ecology, such as stage duration (e.g. juveniles) and size or age at maturity, are still inconclusive for groups such as sea turtles and sharks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C156">Rasmussen and Gruber, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C135">Musick and Limpus, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C60">Gelsleichter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C172">Seminoff <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C82">Heppell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).Laparoscopic (sea turtles and avian species) and cloacascopic examinations (penguins) are sexing techniques used in live and free-ranging immature sea turtles, chicks and adult penguins without reproductive behaviour (e.g. copulation), and have also been used to determine the reproductive condition and maturity status of sea turtles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C2">Ainley <italic>et al.</italic>, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C143">Owens, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C188">Wibbels, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C94">Jessop <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C18">Blanvillain <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).

Cloacascopy, on contrast, requires structures well differentiated in size for successful sexing, and the characteristics of cloacae could differ between bird species, making the applicability of this tool difficult in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C169">Samour <italic>et al.</italic>, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C19">Boersma and Davies, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C42">Costantini <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Ultrasonography is a promising external, non-invasive technique used to evaluate reproductive status based on ultrasound images of the internal organs. This tool is suggested as an alternative for the determination of the reproductive condition of sea turtles and marine mammals (dolphins); however, further studies are needed to evaluate its applicability, particularly to immature or non-reproductive sea turtles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C168">Rostal <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C26">Brook <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C25">Brook, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C18">Blanvillain <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).

As a result of the similarity between the general appearance of the reproductive structures described by ultrasound in active male dolphins and sea turtles (for which comparative data exist) and some correlations found between the measurements taken of the reproductive organs of adult male loggerhead sea turtles with laparoscopy and ultrasonography, such as the epididymal duct diameter (Pearson's <italic>r</italic>â€…=â€…0.91, <italic>P</italic>â€…&lt;â€…0.001), it is possible that ultrasonography may ultimately replace the laparoscopic procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C18">Blanvillain <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).Biometric data (e.g. bill, foot, wing and vent measurements) and comparison of phenotypic characteristics (e.g. clasper morphology, tail size, mean nesting size and plastron softness) are non-invasive, discriminant methods to assess demographic parameters, such as reproductive stage and age/sex determination (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COT035TB1">1</xref>). In sharks, external secondary sexual characteristics of clasper (length, rotation and calcified condition), visual signs of mating and courtship (scars, sperm in clasper and haematoma around the cloacae) and length, when the size at maturity is known for the species, have been used, together with other histological and endocrine approaches, as a sexual discriminant criterion and to assess the maturity of males (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C156">Rasmussen and Gruber, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C97">Joung and Chen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C60">Gelsleichter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C58">Francis and Duffy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C98">Joung <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C180">Sulikowski <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C181">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C138">Norman and Stevens, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C6">Awruch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C7">b</xref>). In the threatened whale shark (<italic>Rhincodon typus</italic>), the sex of 85% of the individuals observed off the coast of Australia (<italic>n</italic>â€…=â€…325) was identified, while diving with the animal, by clasper presence, and sexual maturity was assessed in the total of males found (100%), confirming that clasper condition criterion is a visual, non-invasive approach to assess demographic parameters for this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C138">Norman and Stevens, 2007</xref>).

Laparoscopic and steroid-based studies suggest that the mean nesting size could mislead estimates of population structure, with potential underestimation of the number of males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C118">Limpus <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C133">Miller, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C109">Labrada-MartagÃ³n <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).Despite the great sex classification power of the discriminant analysis obtained from biometric data on seabirds (84â€“100%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C19">Boersma and Davies, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C102">Kerry <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C89">Hull, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C129">Mawhinney and Diamond, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C87">Hocken and Russell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C41">Copello <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), a variety of canonical discriminant functions (biometric classification parameters) has been suggested, between reproductive stages (e.g. flipper length in immature Magellanic penguins (<italic>Spheniscus magellanicus</italic>) vs. bill length in adults; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C13">Bertellotti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>) and between seabird species, making this approach applicable for all age classes (immature), time of birth (chicks) and conditions (wild vs. captive) difficult without previous validation (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COT035TB1">1</xref>). However, this has to be interpreted with caution when used with data from other geographical populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C89">Hull, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C203">Zavalaga and Paredes, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C13">Bertellotti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C174">Setiawan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C41">Copello <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C151">Poisbleau <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Currently, molecular techniques using non-invasive (eggs and feathers) or non-lethal samples (blood) give the most reliable and accurate method for sexing avian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C13">Bertellotti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C27">Bush <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C35">Cerit and Avanus, 2007</xref>; for additional reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C175">Seutin <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C91">Jensen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C27">Bush <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C54">Dubiec and Zagalaska-Neubauer, 2006</xref>).The limitations in pooled analyses include heterogeneity between studies and the different methods of recruiting the controls used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C154">Raimondi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Thus, it is difficult to compare the accuracy and classification power of different approaches used to obtain life history data in wildlife (e.g. biometric data and hormone concentrations), owing to the heterogeneity of the information reported between studies (e.g. means, ranges, percentage of accuracy and correlation coefficients) and the classification criteria used (e.g. sex, age class and reproductive stages), in addition to the specific differences in this review (e.g. sharks, seabirds and sea turtles). Another limitation during the sensitivity analysis, performed on those published reports focusing on validation of the use of hormone concentrations, was the variety of samples (serum, plasma, amniotic fluid and faeces) and validation approaches or controls (e.g. histology, laparoscopy, cloacascopy and photo-identification) used between studies.Histology (sharks, sea turtles and marine mammals), laparoscopy (sea turtles), laparotomy and cloacascopy (seabirds) are the most accurate methods for determining the sex and reproductive condition of the animals, and they have been considered as the reference method (gold standard) to evaluate less-invasive approaches, such as the hormone concentrations. The main disadvantages of the classical direct approaches are logistical complications (e.g. cost, specialized equipment required and dependence on field conditions) and their invasive or lethal characteristics when applied to threatened or endangered species. Photo-identification (marine mammals) and biometric (seabirds), phenotypic (sharks) and behavioural data (seabirds) are non-invasive, external validation methods of sex and reproductive stages, useful only when the information is available (e.g. known size at maturity and clasper condition); they require monitoring studies of the population through the breeding season (e.g. penguins and albatrosses) and expensive, long time series (e.g. 25â€…years of life history data for cetaceans). Using phenotypic characteristics of sea turtles is difficult for immature individuals and when adults are together with sub-adults. The large discriminant accuracy of biometric data when used for sexing seabirds is limited by considerable intra-specific (e.g. age class, reproductive condition and geographical population) and inter-specific variation.The measurement of steroid hormone concentrations has shown great accuracy as a discriminant (71â€“100% accuracy) of sex and reproductive status (when data could be compared), with consistent accuracy between samples (e.g. amniotic fluid and plasma) and studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C68">Gross <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C202">Xia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), thus demonstrating the reproducibility and diagnostic validity of this method. The advantages of hormone determination as a non-lethal and less-invasive tool for the generation of valuable demographic information needed for stock assessment and biological conservation include low cost, the facility for sample preservation, and little time and effort employed in both field and laboratory conditions. Validation of such data is needed in specific populations in order to guarantee the accurate interpretation of subsequent hormone determinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C188">Wibbels, 1999</xref>). There are many descriptive studies on the reproductive endocrinology (the relationship between hormone concentrations and reproductive behaviour) of marine species. A large number of associations have already been demonstrated between sex steroid concentrations and biochemical parameters, gonadal state, reproductive behaviour and secondary external features (e.g. clasper in sharks). However, there is a lack of information about direct quantitative correlations between the gonadal changes observed using lethal methods and the hormone concentrations measured in the individuals (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C192">Wibbels <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C180">Sulikowski <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C181">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C18">Blanvillain <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), even when the information was available, and there are even fewer studies that have proposed some quantitative approach to discriminate demographic parameters based on hormone concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C6">Awruch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008a</xref>).In addition to the use of hormone concentrations as a sexing method, the most recent studies on sharks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C180">Sulikowski <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C181">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C182">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C6">Awruch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008a</xref>) have suggested that measurements of circulating sex steroids can be used as an indirect approximation to assess sexual maturity and reproductive condition in those species without evident secondary sexual characteristics and in the absence of morphological data (e.g. gonadal condition). Clearly, the relationship between plasma hormone changes during puberty and the sexual maturation process could be studied in other marine vertebrate groups, by comparing sex steroid concentrations by age/size classes at pre-mature stages and between groups with or without evident secondary sexual characteristics. This would allow validation of the size classes and pre-mature stages and/or conditions at which hormone determination provides accurate demographic information. The link between deferred sexual maturity and circulating steroid concentrations needs further clarification. Understanding the dynamics of the hormone concentrations during puberty and sexual maturity allows for identification of sex, stage duration, size range at maturation and reproductive condition, expanding the information derived from external characteristics and morphological measurements when used alone. For example, in skates the simultaneous evaluation of multiple techniques has demonstrated that hormone determinations provide more precise estimates of sexual maturity stage (expressing a lag period between gonadal development and functional maturity) than the morphological measurements alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C181">Sulikowski <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). In the East Pacific population of green sea turtles, hormone determination for immature turtles suggests a bias in the estimation of the population structure when considering the mean nesting size as a unique classification criterion (overestimation of adult females due to the absent secondary sexual characteristics expected in males; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C109">Labrada-MartagÃ³n <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).We lack information about demographic data in many marine species and populations that are the focus of conservation interest. The current information available about reproductive endocrinology, stage duration (growth) and age/size at sexual maturity is centred on a few populations (e.g. green sea turtles from Hawaii, Florida and Australia), habitats (nesting grounds) and reproductive stages (adults) in some species. Consequently, key demographic parameters used to establish policies and conservation strategies remain unknown. The information derived from sex steroid concentrations in different stages and size classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C156">Rasmussen and Gruber, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C6">Awruch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C182">Sulikowski <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), together with other phenotypic (e.g. total length and clasper length; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C6">Awruch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008a</xref>) and biochemical parameters that have explained the steroid concentrations measured in immature sea turtles (e.g. glucose, cholesterol and thyroxine levels; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C109">Labrada-MartagÃ³n <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) and energy allocation patterns in adult females (triglycerides; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C74">Hamann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT035C75">b</xref>) form the basis for future determinations on demographic data (e.g. sex and reproductive stage), population structure and seasonal variations in the development and reproductive condition of the populations as well.The authors thank R.
