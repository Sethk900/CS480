The biology of the introduced carp cyprinus carpio L., in the river Cayumapu, Valdivia, ChileCarps were collected monthly, with a net, for one year in the River Cayumapu, Valdivia. The population was mainly constituted by scale carps, followed by mirror carps. Scales were used to determine age and growth. Ten age groups were determined; young populations were found during the warm months and older populations in the cold months. Lengthâ€weight relationship, Condition Factor and Relative Condition factor were studied according to the adaptation of this population to its habitat. The reproduction of this species shows a gonad growth from late Spring till Autumn, then it stabilizes during Winter and spawning begins in early Spring. This gonad cycle is closely related to water temperature. Relative fecundity is related to female length. An average of 120,000 eggs per kg body weight is obtained in the population studied. Carpsâ€™ diet is characterized by the grazing of aquatic plants (Egeria densa), preying upon benthic invertebrates, also whey which is dumped into the river by a lacteal industry. A comparison is established between the adaptational characteristics of this wild population and those studied in Europe and North America. The effect of this introduced species on the habitat and the colonization success is discussed.
