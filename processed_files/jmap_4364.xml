Maizeâ€“planting date interaction and effect of Bt maize on European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner) (Coleoptera: Crambidae) damageAbstract A study was conducted to determine the influence of planting date and transgenic maize on maize yield following stalk injury by European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner). Transgenic and non-transgenic maize hybrids with short- and full-season maturity were planted in late April, mid-May and early June from 2006 to 2008 in Ohio, USA. Maize stem tunnelling was significantly higher on non-transgenic maize and increased with delayed planting. Significantly higher yields were obtained from full-season than short-season hybrids when maize was planted early. The results suggest that when planting is delayed and an European corn borer population is known to cause economic damage in an area, selection of short-season hybrids with the Bt gene can be beneficial in controlling damage and improving yield.
