Harmonizing the International Normalized Ratio (INR)Objectives: To reduce interlaboratory variation and bias in international normalized ratio (INR) results, as used to monitor patients receiving vitamin K antagonist therapy, including warfarin, in a large pathology network (n = 27 laboratories) by procedural standardization and harmonization.  Methods: Network consensus to standardize to common instrument and reagent platforms was established, following development of hemostasis test specifications. Subsequent installations and implementation occurred after conclusion of a government tender process. Network-wide application of simple novel process of verification harmonization of local international sensitive index and mean normal prothrombin time initiated for each new lot of INR reagent that does not require ongoing use of reference thromboplastin or calibration/certified plasma sets.
