Gall-inducing nematodes as ecosystem engineers for arthropods associated with its host plant in the Cerrado of BrazilIn this study we examined the role of a gall-inducing nematode on the diversity of arthropods associated with Miconia albicans (Melastomataceae), acting as an ecosystem engineer. Nematode galls (i.e. leaves and infructescences) supported higher arthropod diversity than healthy plant structures, and some species were found only in the gall. Galled leaves and infructescences harbored species of different trophic levels, suggesting that galls provide distinct resources, such as food tissue and refuge. We conclude that the presence of gall has a strong effect on the diversity and composition of arthropod fauna and a gall inducer can be important microhabitat engineers where they are abundant, having considerable influence on the diversity of small organisms inhabiting plants.
