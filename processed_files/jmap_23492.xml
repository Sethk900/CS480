Systematic and biogeographical study of Protura (Hexapoda) in Russian Far East: new data on high endemism of the groupAbstract Proturan collections from Magadan Oblast, Khabarovsk Krai, Primorsky Krai, and Sakhalin Oblast are reported here. Twenty-five species are found of which 13 species are new records for Russian Far East which enrich the knowledge of Protura known for this area. Three new species Baculentulus krabbensis sp. n., Fjellbergella lazovskiensis sp. n. and Yichunentulus alpatovi sp. n. are illustrated and described. The new materials of Imadateiella sharovi (Martynova, 1977) are studied and described in details. Two new combinations, Yichunentulus borealis (Nakamura, 2004), comb. n. and Fjellbergella jilinensis (Wu & Yin, 2007), comb. n. are proposed as a result of morphological examination. Keys to species of the genera Fjellbergella and Yichunentulus are given. An annotated list of all species of Protura from Russian Far East is provided and discussed. Widely distributed species were not recorded in this area. This may be because of the high sensitivity of Protura to anthropogenic impact and low dispersal ability of the group.
