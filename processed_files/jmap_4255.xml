The Zoeal Stages of Petrolisthes caribensis Werding, 1983 Reared under Laboratory Conditions (Decapoda: Anomura: Porcellanidae)The early larval development of the western Atlantic porcellanid crab Petrolisthes caribensis Werding, 1983 was studied under laboratory conditions. The two zoeal stages are described and illustrated. P. caribensis has bifid lateral spines on the telson of the first zoea. A short serrated seta on the terminal article of the endopodite of the second maxillipeds occurs in both zoeal stages. These characters indicate a higher similarity of the larvae of P. caribensis to the larvae of P. politus, than to those of other congeners of the western Atlantic described so far.
