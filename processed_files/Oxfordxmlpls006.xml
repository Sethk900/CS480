unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Little is known about the genome of <italic>Anthurium</italic> other than chromosome observations, which frequently indicate supernumerary (â€œBâ€) chromosomes. New genome size estimates for 34 species and nine cultivars presented here provide insights into genome organization and evolution in this very large genus.<italic>Anthurium</italic> is an important horticultural crop from the family Araceae, order Alismatales, a lineage considered to have diverged from other monocots prior to the cereals. Genome size and its distribution in <italic>Anthurium</italic> were investigated to gain a basic understanding of genome organization in this large genus and to forge a firm foundation for advancement of molecular approaches for the study of <italic>Anthurium</italic>. Currently, genome size estimates have been reported for only two <italic>Anthurium</italic> samples.Bulk nuclear DNA content estimates were obtained by flow cell cytometry using leaf tissue collected from <italic>Anthurium</italic> species of different subgeneric groups and from commercial cultivars. The most current and well-supported topology of subgeneric, sectional relationships was applied to present genome size estimates in the context of reported chromosome counts, karyotypes, putative phylogenetic relationships, observed phenotypes and pedigree.Genome size estimates based on bulk nuclear DNA content for 77 accessions representing 34 species and 9 cultivars were obtained, including initial estimates for 33 <italic>Anthurium</italic> species, and both the smallest (<italic>Anthurium obtusum</italic>; <italic>Tetraspermium</italic>) and largest (<italic>Anthurium roseospadix</italic>; <italic>Calomystrium</italic>) <italic>Anthurium</italic> genome sizes reported to date<italic>.</italic> Genome size did not distinguish any subgeneric section, but ranged 5-fold (4.42â€“20.83 pg/2 C) despite consistent 2N= 30 chromosome counts. Intraspecies genome size variation &gt;20 % is reported for <italic>Anthurium ravenii</italic>, <italic>A. watermaliense</italic> and <italic>A. gracile</italic>.Genome size estimates for <italic>Anthurium</italic> species spanning 13 recognized subgeneric sections indicate that genome size does not generally correlate with chromosome count or phylogenetic relationships. Mechanisms of genome expansion and contraction, including amplification and reduction of repetitive elements, polyploidy, chromosome reorganization/loss, may be involved in genome evolution in <italic>Anthurium</italic> as in other species. The new information on <italic>Anthurium</italic> genome sizes provides a platform for molecular studies supporting further research on genome evolution as well as cultivar development.<italic>Anthurium</italic> is the most speciose genus in the Araceae, a monocot family defined by its unique inflorescence composed of a spadix and spathe. The spadix holds hundreds of minute flowers compacted on a spike, which is subtended by a more or less showy sterile leaf-like organ, the spathe. <italic>Anthurium</italic> is comprised of âˆ¼900 published and 1500 estimated species endemic to the neotropical zones of northern Mexico and south through Central America to southern Brazil, and on the Caribbean Islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C19">Croat 1988, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C56">Mayo <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C32">Govaerts <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C12">Boyce and Croat 2012</xref>). <italic>Anthurium andraeanum</italic>, native to Colombia, was first introduced to the island of Oahu in 1889, where it flourished and became widely cultivated by amateur breeders and hobbyists who developed many attractive new varieties throughout the 1940s. Beginning in 1950, an intensive breeding programme at the University of Hawai`i at Manoa yielded many unique and improved cultivars using selective breeding, hybridization and <italic>in vitro</italic> propagation of <italic>Anthurium</italic> species. The novel colours and forms, as well as desirable horticultural attributes, generated in these cultivars contributed to the dominance of the anthurium industry by Hawaiian growers for much of the second half of the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C43">Kamemoto and Kuehnle 1996</xref>). We anticipate that future improvements to anthurium cultivars will utilize molecular resources developed to contribute to the basic understanding of this large genus while supporting applied science.Genome size has implications for molecular biology work, genomics and overall successful implementation as a study organism. Genome size is also correlated with seed mass, cell size, stomatal size, stomatal density, length of cell cycle and a host of derivative phenotypes important for plant success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C6">Beaulieu <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C7">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C51">Leitch <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C38">Hodgson <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). Genera with larger genome sizes have limited photosynthetic rates, tend to have limited distribution and tend to be less speciose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C45">Knight <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Genome size in angiosperms varies âˆ¼1000-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C50">Leitch <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>) with the largest genomes found among the monocots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C53">Leitch <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C78">Zonneveld 2010</xref>). Variations in angiosperm DNA content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C8">Bennett and Leitch 2005</xref>) have been interpreted in a robust phylogenetic context to reconstruct genome size evolution, revealing the ancestral genome size to be relatively small (1.4 pg/1 C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C70">Soltis <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>). Significant increases in genome size have been attributed to polyploidy and to amplification of repetitive DNA content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C65">SanMiguel <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C73">Vicient <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C36">Hawkins <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). Secondary downsizing in lineages embedded within clades having larger genome sizes counters the overall trend towards genome size growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C49">Leitch <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C10">Bennetzen <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>).In the family Araceae, genome sizes tend to be moderate, including <italic>Orontium aquaticum</italic> (30 pg/2 C), a species derived from an early-diverging lineage in Araceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C13">Cabrera <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C24">Cusimano <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Genome size estimates have been reported for only two <italic>Anthurium</italic> accessions: <italic>A. schlechtendalii</italic> (15.27 pg/2 C) and <italic>A. grande</italic> Hort. (27.00 pg/2 C) (26 July 2011; <uri xlink:href="http://data.kew.org/cvalues" xlink:type="simple">http://data.kew.org/cvalues</uri>). These are also of moderate size with the genome size estimate for <italic>A. schlechtendalii</italic> 2.8 times that of <italic>Zea mays</italic> (5.45 pg/2 C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C9">Bennett and Smith 1976</xref>), and the estimate for the accession <italic>A. grande</italic> Hort. nearly twice as large as that of <italic>A. schlechtendalii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C30">Ghosh <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). However, in Lemnoideae, the sister group to the true Araceae, the group to which <italic>Anthurium</italic> belongs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C13">Cabrera <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C24">Cusimano <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>), the genera <italic>Lemna</italic> (1.20 pg/2 C) and <italic>Spirodela</italic> (0.60 pg/2 C, 0.74 pg/2 C) have quite small genome sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C29">Geber 1989</xref>). The evolutionary relationship of these lineages suggests that the common ancestor of both Lemnoideae and the true Araceae may have had in place the genomic machinery to secondarily generate species with small genomes and that there may also be <italic>Anthurium</italic> species with small genome sizes.Understanding the organization and composition of the <italic>Anthurium</italic> genome is a prerequisite to the development of molecular resources to support improvement of the <italic>Anthurium</italic> Hort. complex. We set out to document a wider range of <italic>Anthurium</italic> genome sizes and interpret them in the context of the most recent phylogenetic analysis of <italic>Anthurium</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C14">Carlsen 2011</xref>), referencing cytological observations and known mechanisms of genome size evolution to identify trends in genome evolution in <italic>Anthurium</italic>. We sampled most deeply the natural, easily recognized sections <italic>Calomystrium</italic> and <italic>Cardiolonchium</italic> from which the <italic>Anthurium</italic> Hort. complex mainly derives in order to better explore the extent of evolutionary change and gain insight into the events influencing genome evolution in these clades.Nuclear genome size estimations were obtained by flow cell cytometry following the protocol described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C3">Arumuganathan and Earle (1991)</xref>. Genome sizes were obtained for 81 accessions obtained from botanical gardens, anthurium industry growers and cultivar developers. Tissue samples of 50 mg fully expanded, non-senescing leaf tissue were collected and shipped to arrive for analysis within 24 h of collection. Flow cytometry involves chopping of fresh plant material together with an internal standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C28">Galbraith <italic>et al.</italic> 1983</xref>). Ideal internal standards display minimal variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C5">Baranyi and Greilhuber 1996</xref>), match as closely as possible the configuration of DNA (e.g. chromosome structure) in the nucleus of the sample, and have a genome size larger than that of the sample, but not &gt;4 times larger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C71">Suda and Leitch 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C63">PraÃ§a-Fontes <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Monocots display a greater variability in chromosome organization and amount of DNA in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C53">Leitch <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>), so we provided the monocots wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> cv. â€˜Zakâ€™ 30.55 pg/2 C) and barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic> line NE86954 9.69 pg/2 C) as internal standards based on the existing 2-fold range of genome sizes for <italic>Anthurium</italic> found in the plant DNA C values database (26 July 2011; <uri xlink:href="http://data.kew.org/cvalues" xlink:type="simple">http://data.kew.org/cvalues</uri>). We also provided tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> cv. â€˜SR-1â€™ 9.32 pg/2 C). Each nuclear preparation was sampled four times, under the direction of K. Arumuganathan, at the Flow Cell Core Lab, Benaroya Research Institute at Virginia Mason, 1202 Ninth Avenue, Seattle, WA 98101, USA. The mean bulk nuclear DNA content (2 C) of each sample (expressed as picograms) was based on 1000 scanned G0 + G1 nuclei from sample tissue, compared with nuclei of the internal standard.Genome sizes of accessions sampled, listed alphabetically by <italic>Anthurium</italic> species, followed by cultivarsMbp, million base pairs; W, wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> cv. â€˜Zak,â€™ 30.55 pg/2 C); T, tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> cv. â€˜SR-1â€™ 9.32 pg/2 C); ABG, Atlanta Botanical Garden; CJBN, Conservatoire et Jardins Botaniques de Nancy; JBM, Jardin Botanique de MontrÃ©al; JBVL, Jardin Botanique de la Ville de Lyon; MBG, Missouri Botanical Garden; MSBG, Marie Selby Botanical Gardens; NYBG, New York Botanical Garden; UH, University of Hawai`i College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources; USBG, United States Botanic Garden; NG, Novelty Greens; HAIA, Hawaiian Anthurium Industry Association.<sup>a</sup>Genome size and standard deviation have been rounded to two decimal places.<sup>b</sup>Mbp/1 C DNA for plant species is based on 1 pg=978 Mbp according to DoleÅ¾el and Greilhuber (2010) and was calculated prior to rounding genome size (pg/2 C) to two decimal places.Wheat and barley, both monocots, were chosen as internal standards to better reflect the DNA configuration in our <italic>Anthurium</italic> samples. However, when barley was used, sample peaks frequently overlapped those of the internal standard, so most genome sizes are reported using wheat as the internal standard. When overlapping peaks prevented interpretation of results with wheat, or if the genome size was closer to that of the eudicot tobacco, results are reported using that species as an internal standard. In one case (<italic>A. gymnopus</italic>) the sample was processed using a previously evaluated <italic>Anthurium</italic> species as the internal standard (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLS006TB1">1</xref>) because standards were not available at the time of sampling. Genome sizes for 26 accessions obtained using both tobacco and wheat as internal standards were generally within 10 % of the mean, confirming that the use of either standard produces essentially the same results [see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/pls006/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Additional</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/pls006/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Information</ext-link>].<bold>Genome size and chromosome counts of <italic>Anthurium</italic> species presented by subgeneric sections.</bold> Clades of punctate and epunctate Mexican species are proposed new sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C14">Carlsen 2011</xref>).

Of the species we sampled, recent cytogenetic analyses report supernumerary chromosomes exclusively in species assigned to sections <italic>Calomystrium, Cardiolonchium, Porphyrochitonium</italic> and <italic>Pachyneurium</italic> (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS006F1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C66">Sharma and Bhattacharyya 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C68">Sheffer and Kamemoto 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C67">Sheffer and Croat 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C55">Marutani <italic>et al.</italic> 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C18">Cotias-de-Oliveira <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>).The organization of <italic>Anthurium</italic> species chromosome counts and genome sizes according to the accepted subgeneric grouping of species into sections suggests all clades derived from a progenitor lineage having 2N= 30 chromosomes, with occasional polyploidy and cytological variation in most sections. The genome sizes associated with 2N= 30 vary &gt;4-fold (Table 1, Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS006F1">1</xref>). The genome sizes of the two species sampled in section <italic>Polyphyllium</italic> (9.17â€“9.46 pg/2 C) are within 10 % of each other, a variance not greater than within-sample variance (K. Arumuganathan, Flow Cell Core Lab, Benaroya Research Institute, Seattle, WA, USA, pers. commun.). There is evidence for polyploidization in section <italic>Polyphyllium</italic>, with twice as many chromosomes reported for <italic>A. flexile</italic> (2N= 60) as for <italic>A. clidemioides</italic> (2N= 30) (Table 1, Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS006F1">1</xref>). The near equivalence of genome size despite the doubled number of chromosomes may reflect an early polyploidization in the <italic>Polyphyllium</italic> crown group which arose over 11 million years ago (mya) (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS006F1">1</xref>). The genome sizes of the two species sampled in section <italic>Urospadix</italic> (14.32â€“14.36 pg/2 C) are also within 10 % of each other, but are reported to share the same chromosome count (Table 1, Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS006F1">1</xref>) [see Additional Information].The phylogenetic relationships among the traditionally described sections <italic>Xialophyllium</italic>, <italic>Calomystrium</italic> and <italic>Cardiolonchium</italic> are unclear, although it is certain that section <italic>Cardiolonchium</italic> as traditionally defined is not monophyletic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C14">Carlsen 2011</xref>). The genome sizes of two species sampled in section <italic>Xialophyllium</italic> are 5.61â€“12.25 pg/2 C, displaying an approximately proportional relationship between genome size and chromosome count between the two species, suggesting a polyploid event occurring no more than 2.20 mya, the estimated crown group divergence date (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS006F1">1</xref>).<bold>Genome sizes for <italic>Anthurium</italic> accessions sampled.</bold> Estimated genome sizes are shown as million base pairs (Mbp) per 1 C.The mean genome size estimates for the four species represented in section <italic>Cardiolonchium</italic> range from 8.86 to 11.44 pg/2 C, with consistent 2N= 30 and reported occurrence of B chromosomes (FigsÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS006F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS006F2">2</xref>). The range of the mean genome sizes for these species is less than the range of genome size estimates reported for the two accessions sampled for the species <italic>A. ravenii</italic> (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLS006TB1">1</xref>). The intraspecies variation reported for <italic>A. ravenii</italic> (7.54â€“13.32 pg/2 C) reflects âˆ¼43 % difference in genome sizes between the two accessions sampled, each of which had reliable provenance information and resembled no species other than <italic>A. ravenii</italic>. The larger genome size reported for this species is 1.76 times that of the smaller one, suggesting some extent of autopolyploidy in <italic>A. ravenii</italic> and that we may have sampled an accession with a different cytotype. Other species sampled in this section display unremarkable intraspecies variance.The genome size of <italic>A. leuconeurum</italic>, a member of a newly described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C14">Carlsen 2011</xref>) and yet unnamed clade of epunctate Mexican species, is much larger than all those in its sister clade (consisting of <italic>Cardiolonchium</italic>, <italic>Calomystrium</italic>, <italic>Xialophyllium</italic>) with the exception of <italic>A. roseospadix</italic> (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS006F1">1</xref>). The 2N= 35 chromosome count report for <italic>A. leuconeurum</italic> has not been confirmed in over 50 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C58">Mookerjea 1955</xref>), although it is speculated to have possibly included observation of 1â€“5 B chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C68">Sheffer and Kamemoto 1976</xref>).The four species sampled in section <italic>Porphyrochitonium</italic>, a section arising âˆ¼ 4.08 mya, display a more than two-fold range in genome sizes (6.21â€“13.96 pg/2 C). Supernumerary chromosomes have been reported in <italic>A. bakeri</italic>, the only species sampled from section <italic>Porphyrochitonium</italic> varying from 2N = 30. In section <italic>Tetraspermium</italic>, sister clade to <italic>Porphyrochitonium</italic>, <italic>A. obtusum</italic> and <italic>A. scandens</italic> ssp. <italic>pusillum</italic> have similar genome sizes, with one accession of <italic>A. obtusum</italic> having the smallest genome size (4.42 pg/2 C) reported to date in <italic>Anthurium</italic> (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS006F1">1</xref>, TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLS006TB1">1</xref>). <italic>Anthurium obtusum</italic> has been reported as having 2N= 30, and also as 2N= 24, suggesting a ready loss of six chromosomes, or a 20 % decrease. The genome sizes of the two accessions for this species differ by âˆ¼25 % (Table 1, Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS006F1">1</xref>), suggesting that our accessions may have had the different numbers of chromosomes reported for this species. <italic>Anthurium scandens</italic> ssp. <italic>pusillum</italic> has been reported as having 2N= 24. A polyploid event in <italic>A. scandens</italic> may be responsible for the 2N= 48 chromosomes found in <italic>A. scandens</italic> ssp. <italic>scandens</italic>. A different loss of six chromosomes appears evident in the 2N= 84 variant of <italic>A. scandens</italic> ssp. <italic>scandens</italic>, which could arise by the <italic>A. scandens</italic> ssp. <italic>scandens</italic> 2N= 48 cytotype losing six chromosomes to 2N= 42, followed by a polyploidization event to yield the observed 2N= 84.The mean genome sizes of the three species in section <italic>Pachyneurium</italic> (estimated divergence 5.8 mya) range from 8.52 to 15.36 pg/2 C (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS006F1">1</xref>). Relatively wide intraspecies variance is observed between accessions in <italic>A. watermaliense</italic>, which varied âˆ¼20 % from the mean, approaching the intraspecies genome size changes that correlate with chromosome count changes in <italic>A. scandens</italic> of section <italic>Tetraspermium</italic>. However, supernumerary chromosome are the only cytotypic changes reported to occur in section <italic>Pachyneurium</italic>, suggesting that the genome size differences between different accessions observed here might be related to the presence of extra-chromosomal DNA, or that somatic changes in the accessions sampled may have been extensive.The species sampled of section <italic>Leptanthurium</italic>, section <italic>Dactylophyllium</italic>, and <italic>A. lucens</italic>, representing a newly described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C14">Carlsen 2011</xref>) and yet unnamed clade of punctate Mexican species, had relatively larger genome sizes (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLS006TB1">1</xref>, FigsÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS006F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS006F2">2</xref>). In section <italic>Leptanthurium</italic>, one of the three different accessions sampled of <italic>A. gracile</italic> has a genome size nearly 30 % smaller than the other two, which are very similar, suggesting that we sampled two accessions having the same cytotype and a third accession having a different one.<bold>Images of <italic>A. andraeanum</italic> and related cultivars.</bold> (A) <italic>A. andraeanum</italic> Linden (used with permission of Michael Wenzel), (B) <italic>A. andraeanum</italic> Hort. cv. â€˜New Pahoa Redâ€™, (C) <italic>A. andraeanum</italic> Hort. cv. â€˜Marian Seefurthâ€™, (D) <italic>A. andraeanum</italic> Hort. cv. â€˜Midoriâ€™, (E) <italic>A. andraeanum</italic> Hort. cv. â€˜Puananiâ€™, (F) <italic>A. andraeanum</italic> Hort. cv. â€˜Shiboriâ€™, (G) <italic>Anthurium</italic> Hort. â€˜Princess Aikoâ€™, (H) <italic>Anthurium</italic> Hort. â€˜Reginaâ€™ and (I) <italic>Anthurium</italic> Hort. â€˜Miss June Purple.â€™<bold>Genome size estimates of accessions of cultivars and species from <italic>Calomystrium</italic>, <italic>Cardiolonchium</italic> and <italic>Porphyrochitonium</italic>, subgeneric sections with known contributors to commercial anthurium hybrids.</bold> Individual accessions within each series are ordered by increasing genome size.The cultivars with tulip-shaped spathes (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS006F3">3</xref>Gâ€“I), â€˜Princess Aikoâ€™, 'Reginaâ€™, â€˜Purple Passionâ€™ (photograph not available) and â€˜Miss June Purpleâ€™, may have been derived from tulip-shaped species in section <italic>Calomystrium</italic>, or from species in other sections (<italic>Cardiolonchium</italic>, <italic>Porphyrochitonium</italic>) known to contribute to hybrids derived from <italic>A. andraeanum</italic> (e.g. <italic>A. antrophyoides</italic>, <italic>A. ochranthum</italic>, <italic>A. cerrocampanense</italic> and <italic>A. lentii</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C43">Kamemoto and Kuehnle 1996</xref>). Alternatively, cultivars with tulip-shaped spathes may be derived entirely from species reproductively incompatible with <italic>A. andraeanum</italic> (e.g. <italic>Anthurium wendlingeri</italic>, <italic>A. bakeri</italic>, <italic>A. scherzerianum</italic>, <italic>A. lancifolium</italic>, <italic>A. caperatum</italic> and <italic>A. garagaranum</italic>)<italic>.</italic> The pedigrees of the cultivars â€˜Aikoâ€™ and â€˜Reginaâ€™ are in fact known, as they were developed in the University of Hawai`i, Manoa, anthurium breeding programme. The genome size of the â€˜Princess Aikoâ€™ cultivar (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLS006TB1">1</xref>, Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS006F3">3</xref>G) is similar to that of the cultivars with standard-shaped spathes (FigsÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS006F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS006F4">4</xref>) and other accessions sampled in <italic>Calomystrium</italic>, reflecting its derivation from the standard cultivar â€˜Tatsuta Pink Obakeâ€™ and the tulip-shaped section <italic>Calomystrium</italic> species, <italic>A. antioquiense</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C46">Kuehnle <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). The cultivar â€˜Reginaâ€™ (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLS006TB1">1</xref>, Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS006F3">3</xref>H) is derived from earlier cultivars composed of contributions from the smaller-genome-sized <italic>Calomystrium</italic> species (i.e. <italic>A. amnicola</italic>, <italic>A. formosum</italic>, <italic>A. andraeanum</italic> and <italic>A. kamemotoanum)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C43">Kamemoto and Kuehnle 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C46">Kuehnle <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>), and the genome size of â€˜Reginaâ€™ is consistent with that pedigree (FigsÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS006F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS006F4">4</xref>). The cultivar â€˜Purple Passionâ€™ resembles (phenotypically) no species other than <italic>A. amnicola</italic>, and the genome size estimate is consistent with that (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLS006TB1">1</xref>, FigsÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS006F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS006F4">4</xref>). The cultivar â€˜Miss June Purpleâ€™ phenotypically resembles â€˜Reginaâ€™ in many aspects (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS006F3">3</xref>H and I), but the genome size is âˆ¼43 % larger (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLS006TB1">1</xref>, Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS006F4">4</xref>), suggesting a species with a larger genome size in its pedigree (perhaps <italic>A. roseospadix</italic> or <italic>A. lentii</italic>), or possibly an endogenous genome size change occurred in this cultivar.Genome sequencing and comparative mapping have revealed the ancient polyploid nature of angiosperms and provided an insight into the effects of polyploidy on genome evolution in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C2">The Arabidopsis Genome Initiative 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C74">Vision <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C11">Blanc and Wolfe 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C1">Adams and Wendel 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C23">Cui <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C27">Fawcett <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>), while studies in <italic>Oryza</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C75">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>), <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C47">Lagercrantz 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C77">Yogeeswaran <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C76">Wendel 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C48">Leitch and Bennett 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C52">Leitch <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>) reveal downsizing in genomes occurring after polyploidization events. We have used genome size to gain insight into some aspects of genome evolution in <italic>Anthurium</italic>, a genus for which the angiosperm genome size database previously contained data only for one species and one cultivar. In this study, apparent correlation between chromosome count and genome size is only clearly evident in species found in sections <italic>Xialophyllium</italic> and <italic>Tetraspermium</italic>. Although the correlations may be incidental, their importance as clues for the various ongoing processes involved in genome evolution in <italic>Anthurium</italic> should not be excluded.Genome sizes and reported chromosome counts of two species are suggestive of polyploidy events in section <italic>Xialophyllium</italic>. In section <italic>Tetraspermium</italic>, with the smallest genome sizes reported to date, genome sizes reflect reported intraspecies variations in chromosome counts in <italic>A. scandens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C68">Sheffer and Kamemoto 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C67">Sheffer and Croat 1983</xref>), including polyploidy, and suggest additional, subsequent genome changes occurred. The age of genome changes such as polyploidy influences the confidence with which they can be identified since subsequent mutations tend to obscure the original event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C26">Doyle and Egan 2009</xref>). Although the ages of polyploidy events discussed here are not known, they are maximally the ages of the relatively young crown groups, <italic>Xialophyllium</italic> and <italic>Tetraspermium</italic>, to which they belong, which are estimated to have arisen 2.2 and 3.43 mya, respectively. In sections other than <italic>Xialophyllium</italic> and <italic>Tetraspermium</italic>, our data display incongruity between interspecific and intraspecific genome size and chromosome counts reported by others for <italic>Anthurium</italic> and other genera.In sections <italic>Calomystrium, Cardiolonchium, Porphyrochitonium</italic>and <italic>Pachyneurium</italic>, we report interspecies genome size variation without any apparent relationship between genome size and base chromosome number, suggesting that the size difference may be unrelated to a polyploidization event. Therefore, interspecies genome size variation in these sections, particularly in the youngest crown group, <italic>Calomystrium</italic>, suggests a mechanism of genome size change capable of producing large differences in a short span of time. Transposable elements are capable of producing such changes. Up to 80 % of the current <italic>Z. mays</italic> genome is composed of retroelements, most inserted in the last 1â€“3 million years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C64">Rabinowicz and Bennetzen 2006</xref>). Transposable elements may be deleted after initial amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C69">Shirasu <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>), or may persist and play a part in local adaptation, as exemplified by the intraspecific expansion of BARE-1 retroelements in barley in response to elevation and aridity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C42">Kalendar <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Oryza</italic>, genome size variations are associated with changes in repetitive DNA content occurring in the last 3 million years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C10">Bennetzen <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Considering <italic>Calomystrium</italic> is estimated to have arisen âˆ¼1.5 mya, genome changes due to rapid invasion and evolution of repetitive elements may play a role in genome size differences. However, the timeframe for comparable changes to occur in <italic>Anthurium</italic>, a long-lived tropical perennial, may be different than that of the annuals <italic>Zea</italic> spp<italic>.</italic>, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> spp. and <italic>Oryza</italic> spp.Some genome size changes in these sections may be attributable to DNA changes associated with chromosomal reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C42">Kalendar <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>). Chromosome reorganization in <italic>Anthurium</italic> was reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C55">Marutani <italic>et al.</italic> (1993)</xref>, who detected differences in the karyotypes of <italic>A. nymphaefolium</italic> (<italic>Calomystrium</italic>) and <italic>A. ochranthum</italic> (<italic>Cardiolonchium</italic>), which she proposed to have resulted from chromosomal rearrangement. She also observed very similar karyotypes among closely related species in section <italic>Calomystrium</italic>, noting that the <italic>A. roseospadix</italic> karyotype resembled those of <italic>A. kamemotoanum</italic> and <italic>A. formosum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C55">Marutani <italic>et al.</italic> 1993</xref>). This is particularly interesting given that the genome size estimate for <italic>A. roseospadix</italic> is more than twice that of each of the other two, suggesting that this may be an example where similar karyotypes among related species may be composed of chromosomes of different structure or DNA mass. However, the cytotype of the <italic>A. roseospadix</italic> accession we sampled would have to be determined before further inferences can be made.In <italic>Polyphyllium</italic>, the oldest crown group in <italic>Anthurium</italic>, we have a case of extreme differences between reported chromosome count and expected potential genome size, with reported ploidy difference between two species with measured genome sizes that were essentially the same. As ploidy differences within other <italic>Anthurium</italic> species do exist, it is possible that we may have sampled a previously unreported cytotype, as is suspected for <italic>A. ravenii</italic> in section <italic>Cardiolonchium</italic>. However, if verified, this apparent incongruity between chromosome count and measured genome size allows us to consider a loss or gain of bulk nuclear DNA and permits inferences based on evidence from mechanisms of genome evolution elucidated by studies in other species. For example, in rice, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C75">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref> estimate that 35â€“60 % of duplicated genes were lost shortly after genome size expansion as recently as 5 mya. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C47">Lagercrantz (1998)</xref> estimated âˆ¼90 chromosomal rearrangements since <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Brassica</italic> diverged âˆ¼14â€“24 mya, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C77">Yogeeswaran <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref> estimated âˆ¼10 chromosomal rearrangements occurred in the divergence of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis lyrata</italic> âˆ¼5 mya. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C14">Carlsen (2011)</xref> estimated the crown group <italic>Polyphyllium</italic> arose âˆ¼11 mya, well within the time required to accomplish the scope of chromosomal changes as observed in the genus <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.The polyploid origin of <italic>A. clidemioides</italic> is unknown. However, polyploids arising by interspecies hybridization (allopolyploidy) are subject to mismatch repair during recombination of homeologous chromosomes which may generate large-scale deletions contributing to chromosome loss and reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C48">Leitch and Bennett 2004</xref>). The more broadly applicable mechanisms of ongoing unequal recombination and illegitimate recombination of homologous chromosomes also contribute to genome size reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C69">Shirasu <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C25">Devos <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>), in part by double-strand break repair, an essential but error-prone housekeeping function causing increases, decreases and chromosomal reorganizations, which can lead to chromosome loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C31">Gorbunova and Levy 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C44">Kirik <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>). Although the suppositions are intriguing, the disparity between measured genome size and reported chromosome count of <italic>A. flexile</italic> compared with <italic>A. clidemioides</italic> warrants further investigation. It was not possible to evaluate cytotypes for the accessions included in this study. Most samples were contributed by botanical gardens, and thus we did not have the plants available locally for fresh root tip sampling and cytotype determination.The genus <italic>Anthurium</italic> displays considerable flexibility of nuclear DNA quantity and organization, even within species. We report here different genome sizes for different accessions of <italic>A. ravenii</italic>, <italic>A. watermaliense</italic> and <italic>A. gracile</italic> varying &gt;20 % from the mean for the species. Conceptually, intraspecies variation can be viewed as incipient interspecies genome size variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C33">Greilhuber 1998</xref>). Once, genome size seemed to offer promise for delineating species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C60">Ohri 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C30">Ghosh <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>), so reports of intraspecies genome size variations have been scrutinized to identify and eliminate systematic sources of variation, leading to standardization of methods, attention to detail in sample handling and careful selection of internal standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C33">Greilhuber 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C34">2005</xref>). Still, intraspecies variations persist: approximately 10 % of <italic>Curcuma</italic> species sampled displayed intraspecies variation in genome size estimates (2007), while both genome sizes and ploidy levels varied widely in a survey of 244 <italic>Dianthus broteri</italic> individuals collected from 25 populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C4">Balao <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>), similar to results reported here for <italic>A. scandens</italic>. While variant cytotypes may explain the largest differences observed, a lesser amount of intraspecific variation in bulk nuclear DNA content may be attributed to the presence of extrachromosomal material, which can only be convincingly excluded from genome size estimates by determining the cytotype of each accession sampled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C72">Teoh and Rees 1976</xref>). In particular, the origin and evolution of B chromosomes seems to be associated with amplification of tandem repeats on A chromosomes, and can be generated spontaneously following allopolyploidization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C40">Jones and Houben 2003</xref>). It may be that activity of extra-chromosomal DNA in sections <italic>Calomystrium</italic>, <italic>Cardiolonchium, Porphyrochitonium</italic> and <italic>Pachyneurium</italic> has contributed to the range of genome sizes among accessions of the same species in those sections.Furthermore, <italic>Anthurium</italic> cultural practices, including <italic>in vitro</italic> cultivation, clonal propagation and selection for sports, impose extreme selective pressures, capable of activating transposable elements causing intraspecies genome size variations without imposing a reproductive barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C61">Peschke and Phillips 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C37">Hirochika <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>). Indeed, individual cultivars may be selected for phenotypes associated with transposable element activity which has affected genome size, but has more noticeably affected phenotype. For example, variegated cultivars of maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C57">McClintock 1965â€“1966</xref>), <italic>Antirrhinum</italic> (snapdragon) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C17">Coen and Carpenter 1986</xref>), <italic>Convolvulus</italic> (morning glory) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C39">Hoshino <italic>et al.</italic> 1995</xref>), <italic>Dahlia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C59">Ohno <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>) and <italic>Sorghum</italic> carry transposable elements associated with variegation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C16">Chopra <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>), and it may be that the mottled â€˜Shiboriâ€™ cultivar (FigsÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS006F3">3</xref>I and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS006F4">4</xref>), with a slightly larger genome than that of the other standard cultivars, is accomplishing its variegation by similar means.Genome sizes in <italic>Anthurium</italic> display variation suggestive of repeated polyploidy, with evidence for possible re-diploidization in the oldest crown group <italic>Polyphyllium</italic>, and ongoing expansion in the youngest crown group, <italic>Calomystrium. Anthurium</italic> genome size distribution was not distinctly demarcated by ploidy level, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C54">Leong-Å korniÄkovÃ¡ <italic>et al.</italic> (2007)</xref> similarly reported in an analysis of nearly half the <italic>Curcuma</italic> (Zingiberales) species found on the Indian continent. Also, as in <italic>Curcuma</italic>, we found genome size to be useful, together with phenotypic similarities, for insight into the pedigree of cultivars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS006C54">Leong-Å korniÄkovÃ¡ <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). The new information on genome sizes in <italic>Anthurium</italic> will serve as a useful framework from which to launch molecular investigations including map- and sequence-based studies, which may provide further insight into the processes resulting in genome size variation observed in <italic>Anthurium</italic>, which may be similar to those described in other monocots.<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/pls006/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">The following additional information is available in the online version of this article â€“</ext-link>File 1.
