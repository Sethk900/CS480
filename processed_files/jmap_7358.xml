Food and feeding habits of the wattled Jacana jacana, (Charadriformes: Jacanidae) in Middle Parana River FloodplainThe purpose of this work is to analyse the food spectrum of Jacana j. jacana L. in the Middle Parana River floodplain. The stomach contents of 58 specimens shot between June 1979 and December 1980 were investigated. An index of relative importance was used to show the total contribution of each prey species to the diet. The basic food is composed of insects, molluscs and seeds. Crustaceans, arachnids and fishes play a minor role. Fidelity degrees and feeding techniques in aquatic vegetation are studied too.
