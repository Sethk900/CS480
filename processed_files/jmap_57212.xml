Efficient Removal of Cd2+ from Aqueous Solutions by Adsorption on PS-EDTA Resins: Equilibrium, Isotherms, and Kinetic StudiesAbstractBatch adsorption experiments were conducted using environment-friendly prepared chelating ethylenediaminetetraacetic sodium modified polystyrene-based (PS-EDTA) resins as an adsorbent to adsorb Cd2+ from aqueous system in which experimental parameters were studied including solution pH, adsorbent dose, contact time, initial metal concentration and temperature. The Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) isotherm models were employed to analyze the experimental data among which Freundlich isotherm model was found to be suitable for Cd2+ adsorption. In addition, Cd2+ adsorption on PS-EDTA resins fitted well to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Intraparticle diffusion studies revealed that surface adsorption and intraparticle diffusion were both involved in the adsorption of Cd2+ ions. Thermodynamic parameters such as Gibbs free energy (ΔG°), enthalpy change (ΔH°), and entropy change (ΔS°) were calculated and indicated that adsorption of Cd2+ ions onto PS-EDTA resins was a spontaneous and endothermic process. The effects of various salts and coexisting heavy metal ions on Cd2+ ions adsorption were also investigated. Moreover, the results from the sequential adsorption–desorption cycles showed that PS-EDTA resins held good reusability and this could be a potential application in the fixed-bed continuous-flow column for the removal of heavy metals.
