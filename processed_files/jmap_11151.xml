A new shot at a release mechanism for devices attached to free-living animalsDetailed studies of the behavior and location of free-ranging animals can be considerably enhanced with the use of animal-mounted devices. A few devices, such as data loggers, have to be recovered to access the data, whereas satellite tags or radiocollars often are left on the animal after the study period. Recovery of devices, which usually necessitates animal recapture, can be problematic, especially in larger species. This paper presents a new, non-electronic release mechanism, requiring no power source on the animal, that was successfully tested on South American sea lions (Otaria flavescens) in Argentina during the 2003â€“2004 austral summer. The system has potential for many larger terrestrial or aquatic animals.
