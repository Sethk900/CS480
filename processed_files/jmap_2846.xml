Soil and runoff response to dairy manure application on New Mexico rangelandManure disposal is a major challenge for the fast-growing dairy industry in New Mexico. There are Currently over 355,000 milking cows in the state and limited cropland on which to use the manure generated by these cows. On the other hand, 80% of the state lands classified as rangelands are suffering from a lack of organic matter and nutrients. Application of dairy Manure to rangelands Could serve a dual purpose: (1) manure disposal from dairies and (2) soil amendment to improve soil characteristics and promote herbaceous production. Manure was applied at two rates according to phosphorus (P) content: (1) a recommended (light) rate (54 kg P ha(-1)) to enhance blue grama growth and (2) a gross over-application (heavy) rate (493 kg P ha-1) to determine the effects on runoff and soil properties. Light applications enhanced soil properties including decreased sediment runoff, increased soil organic matter, increased extractable P, and increased soil moisture, whereas heavy applications increased soil salinity, sodium adsorption ratio, and runoff water. Dairy manure can be safely applied at light rates to conserve and enhance rangeland soil properties and their herbaceous productivity. Manure disposal at heavy rates are unsafe. Further Study is required to find out if other safe disposal exists between the light and heavy treatments. Published by Elsevier B.V.
