The Thysanoptera Haplothripini (Insecta: Phlaeothripidae) of IranIn Iran, 4 genera and 27 species are recorded of the Thysanoptera tribe Haplothripini (Phlaeothripidae, Phlaeothripinae): Dolicholepta Priesner with 1 species, Haplothrips Amyot and Serville with 23 species, Neoheegeria Schmutz with 2 species, and Plicothrips Bhatti with 1 species. Identification keys are provided to these taxa. Three new synonyms are established: H. inoptatus Priesner is a junior synonym of H. globiceps Bagnall, H. iraniensis Priesner is a junior synonym of H. maroccanus Priesner, and H. scythicus Knechtel is a junior synonym of H. leucanthemi (Schrank). Reports of H. cerealis Priesner from Iran are considered to be misidentifications of H. tritici Kurdjumov, and comments are made on the identity of several predatory species related to H. subtilissimus (Haliday) and H. globiceps Bagnall. Several character states used for recognizing taxa in Haplothrips are discussed, and available biological data for each species are presented.
