Taxonomic notes on Macugonalia geographica (Signoret) with descriptions of the male and female genitalia (Insecta: Hemiptera: Cicadellidae: Cicadellini)Abstract The male and female genitalia of the leafhopper Macugonalia geographica (Signoret) are described and illustrated for the first time based on specimens from southeastern and southern Brazil (Minas Gerais, São Paulo, and Paraná states). External characters of the head, thorax, and abdomen of this species are also described and illustrated. Macugonalia geographica is compared with other species of the genus Macugonalia Young. It is apparently closely related to M. spinolai (Signoret), M. variabilis (Signoret), M. testudinaria (Fowler), M. cavifrons (Stål), M. contaminata (Fabricius), M. fritilla Young, and M. umbrosa Young. Notes on the morphology of the second valvulae of the ovipositor of M. geographica are added.
