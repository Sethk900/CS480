Limonium stocksii  is a potential commercial cut-flower crop for saline areas using brackish water. We therefore were interested to learn about the mechanism of its salinity tolerance. Plants grew well under lower saline conditions (300 mM NaCl) but higher salinities reduced growth. An increase in leaf osmolality and the management of salinity-induced oxidative stress are the key strategies employed. Exogenous AsA application improved the functioning of the AsA-dependent antioxidant system, leading to better growth.  Salinity causes oxidative stress in plants by enhancing production of reactive oxygen species, so that an efficient antioxidant system, of which ascorbic acid (AsA) is a key component, is an essential requirement of tolerance. However, antioxidant responses of plants to salinity vary considerably among species.  Limonium stocksii  is a sub-tropical halophyte found in the coastal marshes from Gujarat (India) to Karachi (Pakistan) but little information exists on its salt resistance. In order to investigate the role of AsA in tolerance, 2-month-old plants were treated with 0 (control), 300 (moderate) and 600 (high) mM NaCl for 30 days with or without exogenous application of AsA (20 mM) or distilled water. Shoot growth of unsprayed plants at moderate salinity was similar to that of controls while at high salinity growth was inhibited substantially. Sap osmolality, AsA concentrations and activities of AsA-dependant antioxidant enzymes increased with increasing salinity. Water spray resulted in some improvement in growth, indicating that the growth promotion by exogenous treatments could partly be attributed to water. However, exogenous application of AsA on plants grown under saline conditions improved growth and AsA dependent antioxidant enzymes more than the water control treatment. Our data show that AsA-dependent antioxidant enzymes play an important role in salinity tolerance of  L. stocksii .  In plants soil salinity causes both osmotic stress and ionic toxicity, which can be lethal under prolonged exposure ( Zhu 2001 ;  Munns and Tester 2008 ;  Yu  et al.  2012 ). Halophytes survive salinity by sequestering salts in vacuoles and accumulating organic osmolytes in their cytoplasm ( Flowers and Colmer 2008 ;  Hameed and Khan 2011 ;  Nedjimi 2014 ), thus reducing ion toxicity while maintaining osmo-balance. Halophytes may also employ shoot succulence, salt exclusion from roots, salt excretion through specialized salt glands and sequestering excess salt in old leaves to complete their life cycle under salinity ( Flowers and Colmer 2008 ;  Shabala and Mackay 2011 ). High salinity typically compromises carbon fixation, leading to the over reduction of light-harvesting complexes that cause production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) ( Ozgur  et al.  2013 ;  Hamed  et al.  2014 ). These ROS are managed within a narrow functionally important range by using enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants ( Jithesh  et al.  2006 ;  Bose  et al.  2013 ). High salt stress, however, can make these systems inadequate causing severe injury that may lead to death ( Hameed and Khan 2011 ).  Ascorbic acid (AsA) plays a key role in salt tolerance of many halophytes ( Jithesh  et al.  2006 ;  Hameed  et al.  2012 ;  Ozgur  et al.  2013 ). It quenches ROS directly as well as through the Asada–Halliwell–Foyer pathway ( Noctor and Foyer 1998 ;  Gest  et al.  2013 ). It also recycles the lipid-soluble antioxidant α-tocopherol ( Lushchak and Semchuk 2012 ). It may also contribute to maintaining photosynthesis, cell-cycle progression, cell wall expansion, gene expression, synthesis of many hormones, anthocyanin and flavonoids ( Smirnoff and Wheeler 2000 ;  Arrigoni and De Tullio 2002 ;  Pignocchi and Foyer 2003 ;  Gest  et al.  2013 ). AsA is absorbed readily after exogenous application ( Younis  et al.  2010 ;  Hameed  et al.  2012 ) and moves within the plant ( Franceschi and Tarlyn 2002 ;  Tedone  et al.  2004 ;  Herschbach  et al.  2010 ). Therefore, foliar application of AsA improves salt tolerance of crop plants in a number of ways ( Athar  et al.  2008 ;  Dolatabadian  et al.  2008 ;  ElHariri  et al.  2010 ;  Farahat  et al.  2013 ), but little information is available on its role in halophytes ( Hameed  et al.  2012 ).   Limonium stocksii , which is found in the coastal areas of Gujarat (India), Sindh and Balochistan (Pakistan) ( Bokhari 1973 ), is a salt-secreting perennial halophyte in Plumbaginaceae. This species is characterized by beautiful pink-purple flowers and has the potential to become a commercially important cut-flower like many other  Limonium  (aka Sea Lavender or Statice) species ( http://www.teleflora.com/about-flowers/statice.asp ). Profit margins could be significantly enhanced if  L. stocksii  could be grown using seawater and on saline land.  Zia  et al.  (2008)  reported that it is a highly salt-tolerant species, but the mechanism of its salt tolerance is not very well understood. We hypothesized that AsA would play a key role in improving salt tolerance; therefore, we investigated: (i) the magnitude of oxidative damage, (ii) levels of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants and (iii) the role of exogenously applied AsA/water, in response to increasing NaCl concentration.  Seed-bearing inflorescences of  L. stocksii  were collected during July 2009 from Hawks Bay, Karachi, Pakistan (24°52′21.87″N, 66°51′24.58″E, 17 ft. altitude, ∼1.5 km away from the sea front). Seeds were separated from the inflorescence and surface sterilized using 1 % sodium hypochlorite for a minute followed by rinsing with distilled water, air-dried and stored at room temperature.  Seeds were sown in plastic pots (12 cm diameter) containing sandy soil and sub-irrigated with half-strength modified Hoagland's solution ( Epstein 1972 ) soon after seedling emergence. Salinity treatments [0 (Control), 300 and 600 mM NaCl] were applied at a rate of 150 mM NaCl per day to minimize osmotic shock. Tap water was used daily to compensate for evaporative loss and the irrigation medium was replaced every third day to avoid salt build up. One week after the final salinity concentrations were reached, plant shoots were sprayed until dripping with AsA (20 mM) or distilled water (each containing 0.1 % Tween-20); these treatments continued twice a week until harvest. Unsprayed plants were controls. Five plants per pot with four pots per treatment were used and were harvested after 30 days of salinity treatment.  Shoot fresh weight (FW) was measured soon after harvest while dry weight (DW) was determined after placing plant samples in a forced-draft oven at 60 °C for at least 48 h or until constant weight was achieved.  Leaf sap osmolality was determined with the help of a vapour pressure osmometer (VAPRO 5520, Wescor Inc., Logan, UT, USA).  Free proline and total soluble sugars (TSS) were quantified in hot-water extracts, which were prepared by boiling finely ground dry plant material in distilled water at 100 °C for 1 h ( Khan  et al.  2000 ). Proline in hot-water extracts was quantified according to  Bates  et al.  (1973) . Diluted hot-water extract (1 mL) was added to 1 mL of ninhydrin : glacial acetic acid (1 : 1 v/v) mixture in a test tube, followed by heating at 100 °C for 1 h. After cooling in an ice-bath, proline was estimated from the absorbance (at 520 nm; Beckman DU-530 spectrophotometer, Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA, USA) of the chromophore extracted in toluene using a standard curve with pure proline.  Total soluble sugars were determined using anthrone ( Yemm and Willis 1954 ). Diluted hot-water extract was mixed with anthrone reagent and incubated in a water bath at 100 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped in an ice bath and absorbance was noted at 630 nm with Beckman DU-530 spectrophotometer.  Ascorbic acid concentration was estimated by using a slightly modified method of  Luwe  et al.  (1993) . Freshly harvested plant sample (0.5 g) was ground in liquid nitrogen mortar and then homogenized in ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (TCA, 1 % w/v). The homogenate was then centrifuged at 12 000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and the supernatant (50 µL) mixed with potassium phosphate buffer (0.95 mL, 100 mM, pH 7.0) and ascorbate oxidase (1 μL of 1 Unit µL −1 ). Oxidation of AsA ( ε  = 14.3 mM −1  cm −1 ) was then recoded at 265 nm.  Antioxidant enzymes were extracted as described by  Polle  et al.  (1994)  with some modifications. Fresh plant samples (0.5 g) were powdered in liquid nitrogen mortar and homogenized in potassium phosphate buffer (5 mL of 100 mM, pH 7.0) containing 0.5 % triton X-100, 2 % (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone, 5 mM disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 1 mM  l -AsA. Homogenates were then centrifuged at 12 000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and the supernatants used in enzyme assays carried out at 25 °C. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD; EC 1.15.1.1) was measured by the method of  Beauchamp and Fridovich (1971) ; catalase (CAT; EC 1.11.1.6) by  Aebi (1984) ; guaiacol peroxidase (GPX, EC 1.11.1.7) by  Zaharieva  et al.  (1999) ; ascorbate peroxidase (APX, EC 1.11.1.11) by  Nakano and Asada (1981)  and glutathione reductase (GR, EC 1.6.4.2) by  Foyer and Halliwell (1976) . Enzyme activities were defined as in original methods and expressed as units of enzyme activity per milligram protein, which was estimated according to  Bradford (1976) .  Endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) was measured using the method of  Loreto and Velikova (2001) .  The extent of lipid peroxidation was estimated by quantifying the malondialdehyde (MDA) content of leaves according to the method of  Heath and Packer (1968) .  Statistical analysis of the data was carried out using SPSS version 11.0 for windows ( SPSS Inc. 2001 ). Two-way analysis of variances (ANOVAs) were used to determine whether salinity, exogenous treatments and their interactions as grouping factors had significant effect on response variables such as biomass and biochemical parameters. A post hoc Bonferroni test was performed to find significant ( P  &lt; 0.05) differences among individual means of the treatments.

Different capital letters across salinity treatments and small letters within each salinity level are significantly different from each other ( P  &lt; 0.05; Bonferroni test).   Limonium stocksii  gained similar biomass over 30 days in 300 mM NaCl as in the absence of salt; however, a further increase in salinity markedly inhibited biomass production. Although growth inhibition occurred at high salinity,  L. stocksii  appears to be more tolerant than other members of the genus: as growth inhibition was observed in  L. perezii  at 110 mM NaCl ( Grieve  et al.  2005 ) and in  L. sinense  at 300 mM NaCl ( Ding  et al.  2009 ); growth of  L. pectinatum  was promoted at 100 mM NaCl and was similar to control at 200 mM NaCl ( Morales  et al.  2001 ). Our results are also similar to growth responses reported for co-occurring halophytes such as  Suaeda fruticosa ,  Arthrocnemum macrostachyum ,  Avicennia marina ,  Aeluropus lagopoides  and  Urochondra setulosa  ( Gul and Khan 1998 ;  Aziz and Khan 2000 ;  Khan  et al.  2000 ;  Gulzar and Khan 2006 ).  Halophytes utilize internal inorganic ions (Na +  and Cl − ) for osmotic adjustment, by sequestering them in vacuoles with associated synthesis and accumulation of organic/compatible solutes in the cytoplasm ( Wyn Jones and Gorham 2002 ;  Flowers and Colmer 2008 ;  Hussin  et al.  2013 ). The increase in leaf sap osmolality of  L. stocksii  seedlings with rise in external salinity could be an indicator of such solute accumulation for osmotic adjustment. The linear increase in shoot Na +  and Cl −  ions in  L. stocksii  seedlings reported in an earlier study ( Zia  et al.  2008 ) also supports this assumption. Similar results have been reported for co-occurring species such as  S. fruticosa  ( Hameed  et al.  2012 ),  A. marina  ( Aziz and Khan 2000 ) and  U. setulosa  ( Gulzar and Khan 2006 ). Accumulation of compatible solutes such as choline- O -sulfate and betaines of β-alanine, proline and hydroxyl-proline, as reported for taxa within Plumbaginaceae, could also be responsible for osmotic adjustment in our test species ( Hanson  et al.  1994 ;  Gagneul  et al.  2007 ;  Flowers and Colmer 2008 ).  Salinity is widely reported to enhance production of ROS ( Ozgur  et al.  2013 ), which can damage important cell components such as proteins, lipids and nucleic acids ( Blokhina  et al.  2003 ;  Apel and Hirt 2004 ;  Gill and Tuteja 2010 ). We also observed an increase in H 2 O 2  concentration (a common ROS) in  L. stocksii  seedlings in response to increasing salinity, as reported for many other halophytes ( Jithesh  et al.  2006 ;  Ozgur  et al.  2013 ). Lipid peroxidation, a non-enzymatic autoxidation process due to ROS, is commonly used as a measure of salinity-induced oxidative stress and plant sensitivity ( Ozgur  et al.  2013 ). It is generally measured in terms of MDA contents, which are common end-products of lipid peroxidation. Generally, a positive linear relationship between MDA concentration and salinity is reported for halophytes ( Jithesh  et al.  2006 ;  Ozgur  et al.  2013 ). For instance, MDA concentrations increased with increasing salinity in halophytes such as  Cakile maritima  ( Ksouri  et al.  2007 ),  Sesuvium portulacastrum  ( Lokhande  et al.  2011 ),  Gypsophila oblanceolata  ( Sekmen  et al.  2012 ) and  Sphaerophysa kotschyana  ( Yildiztugay  et al.  2013 ). We also found a linear increase in MDA concentrations with increasing NaCl treatments in  L. stocksii . Although the relationship between MDA levels and plant performance is complex ( Hameed  et al.  2012 ;  Alhdad  et al.  2013 ), some stress signalling roles of MDA are also emerging ( Weber  et al.  2004 ). Slightly higher MDA concentrations in  S. fruticosa  ( Hameed  et al.  2012 ) were associated with better growth.  Halophytes employ a number of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants to prevent oxidative damage and keep ROS concentrations within a narrow functional rage ( Jithesh  et al.  2006 ;  Ozgur  et al.  2013 ). Superoxide dismutase is considered the first line of defence against ROS under stress conditions ( Alscher  et al.  2002 ).  Limonium stocksii  seedlings under saline conditions showed increased activity of SOD, which was similar to that reported for  Bruguiera parviflora  ( Parida  et al.  2004 ),  Atriplex portulacoides  ( Benzarti  et al.  2012 ) and  S. portulacastrum  ( Lokhande  et al.  2011 ). Catalase activity in  L. stocksii  remained unchanged with the increase in salinity indicating either constitutive expression or importance of other than CAT-based H 2 O 2  detoxification under salinity stress. Similar CAT activity was also reported for another halophyte  A. portulacoides  in up to 400 mM NaCl salinity ( Benzarti  et al.  2012 ). Guaiacol peroxidase activity increased significantly in  L. stocksii  seedlings under salinity as in  B. parviflora  under saline conditions ( Parida  et al.  2004 ). Apart from their role in H 2 O 2  detoxification, GPXs are also involved in a number of physio-chemical processes such as growth, auxin metabolism, biosynthesis of ethylene and lignin ( Lagrimini and Rothstein 1987 ;  Dionisio-Sese and Tobita 1998 ;  Kim  et al.  1999 ;  Matamoros  et al.  2003 ;  Jouili  et al.  2011 ). Activities of APX and GR were reported to increase in  A. portulacoides  ( Benzarti  et al.  2012 ),  Salicornia brachiata  ( Parida and Jha 2010 ) and  B. parviflora  ( Parida  et al.  2004 ) under salinity stress ( Jithesh  et al.  2006 ). A similar increase in the activities of these enzymes in  L. stocksii  was also observed indicating their role in ROS detoxification under salinity stress.  Many low-molecular-weight antioxidant substances such as AsA are also involved in ROS detoxification in halophytes ( Jithesh  et al.  2006 ;  Hameed and Khan 2011 ). AsA contents of  L. stocksii  leaves increased under saline conditions similar to  Sphaerophysa kotschyana  ( Yildiztugay  et al.  2013 ). Increased AsA concetrations in  L. stocksii  could be due to better recycling via the Asada–Halliwell–Foyer pathway and/or its increased biosynthesis. Soluble sugar concentrations of  L. stocksii  leaves increased under saline conditions and this supports a direct relationship between sugar (sucrose) concentration and AsA biosynthesis ( Nishikawa  et al.  2005 ). Soluble sugars can also act as ROS scavengers ( Couée  et al.  2006 ;  Nishizawa  et al.  2008 ;  Keunen  et al.  2013 ).  Proline accumulation is often used as stress indicator in plants ( Kishor and Sreenivasulu 2013 ;  Ben Rejeb  et al.  2014 ). However, proline levels remained unchanged in  L. stocksii  seedlings under saline conditions. This may indicate adequate stress management and the absence of injury symptoms also supports this assumption.  Experiments for studying effects of exogenous application of different chemicals such as AsA involve spray of aqueous solutions and any improvement in growth and salt tolerance by such treatments may be due to water rather than the chemical.  Hameed  et al.  (2012)  showed the importance of such water-spray in salinity tolerance of a coastal halophyte  S. fruticosa . Water-spray improved sub-cellular defence in  S. fruticosa  probably by mitigating osmotic constraint thereby water acquisition ( Hameed  et al.  2012 ). Water-spray on  L. stocksii  seedlings resulted in a significant improvement in growth and levels of antioxidant enzymes. This indicates that the improvement in growth by exogenous AsA treatment could partly be due to water in the solution rather than the AsA itself: an increase in leaf water content and levels of TSS and proline and low oxidative damage support this conclusion. However, the DW was greater in the AsA treatment than the water-spray alone at all salinities (Fig.  1 ), suggesting specific effects of AsA. At high salinity, the TSS concentration and the activities of the antioxidant enzymes were higher with the AsA-treatment than with the water-spray alone (only for GPX the difference was not significant). The proline concentration was higher in the AsA treatment than with the water-spray at the 300 mM treatment, but not at the higher salinity. Based on our results, it appears that AsA does bring about specific improvements to growth and these were associated with biochemical changes in the leaves. Similar results for the treatment with AsA have been reported for  S. fruticosa  ( Hameed  et al.  2012 ) and in many non-halophytes ( Shalata and Neumann 2001 ;  Dolatabadian  et al.  2008 ;  Younis  et al.  2010 ). Exogenously applied AsA is easily absorbed, transported and metabolized in plants ( Sapers  et al.  1991 ;  Franceschi and Tarlyn 2002 ), where it has a variety of metabolic and physiological functions in antioxidant defence, photosynthesis, transmembrane electron transport, biosynthesis of plant hormones and/or cell expansion ( Conklin  et al.  1996 ;  Arrigoni and De Tullio 2000 ,  2002 ;  Khan  et al.  2011 ).  Exogenous application of AsA decreased lipid peroxidation in  L. stocksii  seedlings under salinity as reported for  S. fruticosa  ( Hameed  et al.  2012 ) and in crops such as  Brassica napus  ( Dolatabadian  et al.  2008 ) and  Phaseolus vulgaris  ( Saeidi-Sar  et al.  2013 ), indicating better antioxidant defence.  Shalata and Neumann (2001)  pointed out that the protective effects of exogenous AsA appeared to be related to its antioxidant activity rather than its possible use as an organic substrate for respiratory metabolism. Exogenous AsA significantly increased levels of endogenous AsA and Asada–Halliwell–Foyer pathway enzymes in  L. stocksii  seedlings compared with both un-sprayed and water-sprayed plants. Likewise, exogenous AsA also increased APX and GR activities in  Vicia faba  seedlings compared with control plants ( Younis  et al.  2010 ). These findings show that the exogenous AsA improves salinity tolerance through stimulating antioxidant defence.  Pictorial description of key findings.
