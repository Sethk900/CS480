First record of the genus Koreanurina Najt and Weiner (Collembola: Neanuridae: Pseudachorutinae) from China, with description of two new species from Changbai mountainThe genus Koreanurina Najt and Weiner, 1992 is recorded for the first time from China. It is redefined and its similarity with the subfamily Caputanurininae is stressed. Two species are described from Changbai Mountain in North-East China: Koreanurina weinerae sp. nov. and K. alba sp. nov. The first species differs from the other species of the genus, mostly by its post-antennal organ located on the lateral edge of head (versus dorsolaterally), its central plate on head wider and the presence of only 1 + 1 chaetae on Th I (versus 2–3 + 2–3). K. alba sp. nov. differs from the other species of the genus mostly by the absence of body pigment, and the presence of only 1 + 1 chaetae posteriorly to the furcal rest (versus 2 + 2).http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:65366D33-890A-4E67-B581-5D32406C078F
