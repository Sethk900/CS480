Maternal influences on reproduction in two populations of Columbian ground squirrels.In this study, we examined influences of maternal traits on offspring birth mass, growth rate, and weaning mass for two populations of Columbian ground squirrels (<em>Spermophilus columbianus</em>). We tested relationships between maternal body condition, structural size, change in mass (during gestation, during lactation, and during the entire reproductive period), timing of reproduction, and litter size on offspring traits using path analyses. To assess whether maternal investment in offspring traits extended beyond the period of direct maternal care, we examined associations between offspring traits and overwinter survival of pups. In general, females in better condition raised pups that were heavier at weaning and that had faster growth rates during lactation. Litter size had a negative effect on mass and growth rate, and only litter size had a significant effect on birth mass. For both populations, the average weaning mass of pups within a litter had a positive effect on the number of pups that survived to yearling age. In a population for which birth masses and growth rates were available, pups with faster growth rates survived better to yearling age, whereas birth mass had no effect on the number of surviving offspring in litters. We found substantial maternal influences on offspring growth and size, and evidence that these influences may extend beyond the juvenile period and constitute influences on fitness. The key to arriving at these conclusions was to take the number of offspring into account before testing for maternal effects.
