Underground ecology in a Patagonian steppe: Root traits permit identification of graminoid species and classification into functional types.There is limited knowledge about root morphological differences at the species level. Consequently, plant ecological groups are largely defined on aboveground traits. Our hypothesis was that roots of graminoid species differ in morphological and functional attributes. In field and greenhouse studies, we measured morphological and functional root traits of eight dominant graminoids. Multivariate analyses of root traits arranged species into two groups. Species were unequivocally classified by either discriminant analysis or a taxonomic key. Traits that contributed most to identification were diameter, colour, and branching. Species from one group had large root diameters, more branching, and lower tensile strength, specific length, rate of new root generation, and RGR than the other group. The grouping by root traits matched previous classifications: one group had been described as more xerophytic, less preferred by livestock, and more delayed in phenology than the second group. Our study shows that (1) a set of root morphological traits may be reliably used to recognize species, and (2) root traits reflect the major ecological grouping of species, even when they all belong to the same growth form. For Patagonia and similar sites, our work will open the way to more detailed, specific-level studies on community underground organization.
