A preliminary inquiry into an Asian topsyâ€turvy Dom, Allobathynella with the description of a new species from South Korea and redescription of A. japonica (Crustacea, Syncarida, Parabathynellidae)Allobathynella japonica Morimoto and Miura, 1957 and a new species of Allobathynella from South Korea are described with detailed descriptions of each male thoracopod VIII. The new species, A. shinjongieei sp. nov., differs from its congeners in having a median seta on the inner margin of the fifth antennular segment, ten spines on the uropodal sympod and in the absence of an epipod in thoracopods Iâ€“III. Allobathynella shinjongieei belongs to the mirabilis group which otherwise includes A. japonica, A. mirabilis and A. coreana. The mirabilis group is assumed to be a distinct taxonomic unit. The supporting characters for this assumption are the bellâ€formed male thoracopod VIII attaching perpendicularly to the body which has a flat and round epipod, the absence of the mandibular proximal tooth and the absence of the seta on the pleotelson.
