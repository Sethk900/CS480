A revision of the genus Kaszabister Mazur (Histeridae,Â Histerinae, Exosternini)Abstract We revise the four species of Kaszabister Mazur, 1972, one of which, Kaszabister barrigai sp. n., is described as new. The other species in the genus are Kaszabister rubellus (Erichson, 1834), Kaszabister ferrugineus (Kirsch, 1873) and Kaszabister carinatus (Lewis, 1888). The species are principally known from the subtropics of South America, with one in Central America. Lectotypes are designated for Kaszabister rubellus and Kaszabister ferrugineus, and a key is provided for all the species. Ants of the genus Solenopsis Westwood, mainly Solenopsis invicta Buren and Solenopsis saevissima (Smith), are documented as hosts of three of the four species.
