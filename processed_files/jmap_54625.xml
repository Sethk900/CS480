Preferential paths of flow under conventional and conservation tillagePreferential solute movement through conservation and conventional tillage soil profiles was investigated by applying bromide and dye tracers to undisturbed soil columns at an application rate which did not create ponding or runoff. In both tilled and untilled soils preferential flows were established with much of the soil well below saturation. Spatial variations in the solute flows were observed by monitoring the column effluent flowing from a grid lysimeter. Dye in effluent flowing at lower water velocity was more retarded than dye traveling in higher velocity effluent.
