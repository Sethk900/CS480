Process studies of a chernozemic pedon, Alberta (Canada)Soil-forming processes in a Gleyed Black Chernozemic (Aquic Cryoboroll) pedon in central Alberta, Canada, were investigated. Vegetation similar to the present Boreal Transition Forest seems to have occupied the region during the Late Holocene. The influence of this forest ecosystem appears compatible with observed pedon properties, notably a well-structured, base-saturated mull A horizon. Rapid soil moisture depletion during the growing season limits the potential for leaching. Readily decomposed, calciumrich litter, particularly from understorey shrubs, and cation leaching from the forest canopy maintain a high base status and mild weathering environment. Faunal and other processes promote rapid formation of characteristic A horizon fabrics. The suitability of some current Canadian soil taxonomic concepts is discussed.
