We demonstrate that higher air humidity mitigates the effect of low soil water availability on broadleaved trees during dry years by reducing stomatal limitation to photosynthesis, allowing higher net photosynthetic rates and supporting higher growth rates. At the same time, rising atmospheric humidity increases sensitivity of canopy conductance to water deficit and reduces the responsiveness of intrinsic water-use efficiency. The results imply that a future rise in atmospheric humidity at high latitudes may be disadvantageous in evenly rainy/humid years and expose trees to higher dehydration risk during weather extremes, although mitigating the impact of soil water deficit under moderate drought.  An increase in average air temperature and frequency of rain events is predicted for higher latitudes by the end of the 21st century, accompanied by a probable rise in air humidity. We currently lack knowledge on how forest trees acclimate to rising air humidity in temperate climates. We analysed the leaf gas exchange, sap flow and growth characteristics of hybrid aspen ( Populus tremula  ×  P. tremuloides ) trees growing at ambient and artificially elevated air humidity in an experimental forest plantation situated in the hemiboreal vegetation zone. Humidification manipulation did not affect the photosynthetic capacity of plants, but did affect stomatal responses: trees growing at elevated air humidity had higher stomatal conductance at saturating photosynthetically active radiation ( g  s sat ) and lower intrinsic water-use efficiency (IWUE). Reduced stomatal limitation of photosynthesis in trees grown at elevated air humidity allowed slightly higher net photosynthesis and relative current-year height increments than in trees at ambient air humidity. Tree responses suggest a mitigating effect of higher air humidity on trees under mild water stress. At the same time, trees at higher air humidity demonstrated a reduced sensitivity of IWUE to factors inducing stomatal closure and a steeper decline in canopy conductance in response to water deficit, implying higher dehydration risk. Despite the mitigating impact of increased air humidity under moderate drought, a future rise in atmospheric humidity at high latitudes may be disadvantageous for trees during weather extremes and represents a potential threat in hemiboreal forest ecosystems.  With rapid increases in global industrial development, fossil fuel use and changing land-use practices, atmospheric CO 2  concentration ([CO 2 ]) is expected to double within the 21st century. This increase will result in global climate changes: global mean water vapour concentration, evaporation and precipitation rates, as well as global mean surface temperature are projected to increase during the 21st century ( IPCC 2007 ). These changing climate factors along with rising [CO 2 ] affect the physiological performance of plants: CO 2  assimilation, transpiration, stomatal conductance ( g  s ) and ultimately plant growth and productivity.  The impact of the most common consequences of climate change—drought, high temperature and high atmospheric vapour pressure deficit (VPD)—on photosynthesis and water use in C 3  plants has been quite well studied, because the occurrence of extreme temperatures, soil water deficit and high VPD, as well as their interactions, alters the physical properties and yield of plants, which are important to agriculture and forestry ( Fletcher  et al.  2007 ;  Guha  et al.  2010 ;  Estrada-Campuzano  et al.  2012 ;  Kuster  et al.  2013 ;  Li  et al.  2013 ;  Sapeta  et al.  2013 ). Considerably less is known of the effect of increasing atmospheric humidity on plants. Increases in precipitation are considered very likely at high latitudes in the long-term perspective ( IPCC 2007 ). Precipitation is predicted to increase in northern Europe, especially in winter, and to decrease in southern and central Europe in summer ( Räisänen  et al.  2004 ). There might also be fewer dry days at higher latitudes by the end of the 21st century ( IPCC 2007 ). Increasing rainfall frequency results in higher relative air humidity at local or regional scales.  The leaves of plants grown at high relative humidity (RH) have larger stomata, larger stomatal pore aperture and length, and significantly lower stomatal density due to larger epidermal cells than in plants grown at moderate RH ( Torre  et al.  2003 ;  Nejad and Van Meeteren 2005 ;  Arve  et al.  2013 ). Therefore, decreasing VPD may lead to increased stomatal conductance and to a consequent increase in transpiration in some plant species grown at high RH ( Pospíšilová 1996 ;  Fordham  et al.  2001 ;  Nejad and Van Meeteren 2005 ). Nevertheless, most findings suggest that a decrease in VPD generally leads to decreased steady-state leaf transpiration or sap flux density in a wide range of tree species from different habitats ( Pataki  et al.  1998 ;  Meinzer 2003 ;  Bovard  et al.  2005 ;  Hölscher  et al.  2005 ). Our previous studies have demonstrated decreased sap flux density in response to increased air humidity in silver birch ( Betula pendula ) and hybrid aspen ( Populus tremula  ×  P. tremuloides ) trees in moist summers ( Kupper  et al.  2011 ).  Growing at high RH not only alters stomatal morphology, but stomatal functioning as well ( Fanourakis  et al.  2010 ,  2011 ). It is known that RH is a key environmental factor mediating changes in stomatal sensitivity to CO 2  ( Talbott  et al.  2003 ). Moreover, RH affects stomatal response to water availability and drought. Plants grown at high RH are less hydrosensitive than plants grown at moderate RH: stomata of high-RH-grown leaves are less sensitive to decreases in leaf water potential than moderate-RH-grown leaves, and the homogeneity, speed and degree of stomatal closure are less in high-RH-grown plants ( Nejad and Van Meeteren 2005 ;  Rezaei Nejad  et al.  2006 ;  Rezaei Nejad and Van Meeteren 2008 ). Therefore, plants developed under moderate RH are able to retain higher water status due to more efficient stomatal control.  Arve  et al.  (2013)  revealed that stomata developed under high RH respond to neither darkness nor drought, but remain open. Thus, high RH may even override the signals given by darkness. The stomata of plants growing in naturally waterlogged soil are also less sensitive to decreasing VPD than those of plants growing in well-drained soil ( Sellin 2001 ).  High RH does not change only the stomatal characteristics of plants. Our previous experiments with silver birch and hybrid aspen have shown that elevated atmospheric RH lowers leaf nutritional status by altering nutrient movement via mass flow in soil and lowering nutrient transfer through xylem flow into leaves ( Tullus  et al.  2012 a  ;  Sellin  et al.  2013 ). The changes in leaf nutrient content and P : N ratio in turn cause a decline in photosynthetic capacity and ultimately changes in tree growth rate.  Experiments on stomatal responses to air humidity and plant stress resistance are typically carried out in greenhouses or growth chambers with seedlings or saplings growing in pots. The objective of the present study was to investigate how artificially increased RH during leaf development affects the sap flow, stomatal responses and photosynthetic parameters of hybrid aspen ( P. tremula  ×  P. tremuloides ) under free-air conditions. Hybrid aspen is a fast-growing deciduous tree species suitable for short-rotation forestry in the relatively cold climate of northern Europe ( Tullus  et al.  2012 b  ). Our aim was to test the following hypotheses. (i) Trees grown at higher atmospheric humidity have higher stomatal conductance and lower water-use efficiency (WUE) than control trees. (ii) The photosynthetic capacity of leaves developed in humid air is lower because of reduced nitrogen uptake due to lower transpirational flux density. (iii) Plants grown in a more humid atmosphere are unable to adjust their WUE quickly because of acclimation to lower VPD or possible stomatal malfunction.  Weather data in the growing period of 2011: the dark line indicates monthly average air temperature, and the grey bars indicate monthly precipitation.  Daily average values of soil water potential at a depth of 15–30 cm in control and humidification plots from June to August in 2011. Scale bars denote SEM.  Hourly average values of air VPD in control and humidification plots from June to August in 2011. Scale bars denote SEM.  We sampled gasometrically nine trees (mean height 3.8 m) from  C  plots and nine trees (mean height 3.3 m) from  H  plots (i.e. three trees per sample plot) for 1 month, from mid-July to mid-August. Measurements were performed on rainless misting-free days on intact fully expanded leaves  in situ  with a portable photosynthesis system LCpro+ (ADC BioScientific, Great Amwell, UK) at constant air humidity (13 mbar), CO 2  concentration ( C  a  = 360 µmol mol −1 ) and temperature of the leaf chamber (25 °C). Leaf-to-air vapour pressure difference was relatively similar in the two treatments: on average 2.12 kPa for  C  plants and 1.99 kPa for  H  plants. To generate photosynthetic light response curves ( A / Q  curves), four leaves per tree were sampled from the middle part of the crown with an instrument equipped with an LED light source. The measurements started with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at 1196 µmol m −2  s −1 , then decreased stepwise to 9 µmol m −2  s −1  and increased stepwise from 1196 to 1803 µmol m −2  s −1 . Intrinsic water-use efficiency, expressed as the ratio of net photosynthesis ( A  n ) to stomatal conductance to water vapour ( g  s ), was determined at two levels of irradiance: at 400–600 µmol m −2  s −1  when IWUE was usually at a maximum (IWUE max ) and at light intensities corresponding to full sunlight (IWUE sat ;  Q ≥ 1400 µmol m −2  s −1 ).  The response of net photosynthesis to varying intercellular CO 2  concentration ( C  i )— A / C  i  curves—was also determined on intact leaves (four leaves per tree)  in situ  at constant air humidity (13 mbar), temperature of the leaf chamber (25 °C) and at saturating irradiance (1500 μmol m −2  s −1 ). External CO 2  concentration ( C  a ) was supplied in 11 steps, decreasing from 360 to 60 µmol mol −1  and then increasing from 450 to 1600 µmol mol −1 . In addition to IWUE max  and IWUE sat  calculated from the data of  A / Q  curves, IWUE in  (initial IWUE) was determined using initial values of the  A / Q  and  A / C  i  sequences when external [CO 2 ] was 360 µmol mol −1 .  Tree height ( H , cm) and stem diameter at 30-cm height ( D , mm) of all aspen trees growing at three  C  and three  H  plots were measured before and after the 2011 growing season.  H  was measured with a telescopic Nedo mEssfix-S measuring rod (Nedo GmbH &amp; Co.KG, Dornstetten, Germany) and stem diameter with a LIMIT digital caliper (Luna AB, Alingsås, Sweden). Current annual increment of the trees (Δ H , Δ D ) was estimated as the difference between the two measurements. Relative increment (Δ H  rel , Δ D  rel ) was expressed as the ratio of Δ H  and Δ D  to their respective characteristics at the beginning of the growing season. The ratio of  H : D  was defined as tree slenderness ( S ).  Statistical data analysis was carried out using Statistica, Ver. 7.1 (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA). Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the sap flux density ( F ) and canopy conductance to water vapour ( g  C ) between trees from the control and the misting treatment. The daily averages of  F  and  g  C  were analysed altogether on 31 days from 1000 to 1700 h from 14 June to 7 August 2011 (DOY: 165–176, 197–201, 206–219). Linear regression analysis was carried out to estimate relationships between  F ,  g  C , VPD and  Ψ  S . The normality of the regression residuals was checked using the Shapiro–Wilk test.  The gasometric data were analysed with Photosyn Assistant, Ver. 1.2 software (Dundee Scientific, Dundee, UK). The  A / Q  curves were fitted as a non-rectangular hyperbola expressed as a quadratic equation by  Prioul and Chartier (1977) . The initial slope of the curve expresses the apparent quantum efficiency ( ϕ ), whereas the  X  and  Y  axes intercepts, respectively, correspond to the light compensation point ( Q  comp ) and apparent dark respiration ( R  d ), and the upper asymptote approximates the light-saturated rate of photosynthesis ( A  max ). An additional parameter—convexity ( θ )—is required to describe the rate of bending between the linear increase and the maximum value. Sub-stomatal cavity CO 2  concentration ( C  i ) was calculated using the model of  von Caemmerer and Farquhar (1981) .  Soil water potential (kPa) estimates of the experimental plots:  Ψ  S_mean , mean across the growing season;  Ψ  S_Q25 , lower quartile;  Ψ  S_Q75 , upper quartile.  Daily average values of sap flux density ( F ) and canopy conductance to water vapour ( g  C ) in control and humidification plots during mist fumigation from June 14 to June 25 (DOY: 165–176; A and C) and July 15 to August 7 (DOY: 197–219; B and D), 2011.

Values are means ± SE; different letters denote statistically significant ( P  &lt; 0.05) differences.  The mean values of relative stomatal limitation of photosynthesis ( L  S ) were lower in trees grown at elevated RH than in  C  trees—37.9 and 41.3 %, respectively ( P  &lt; 0.05; Table  2 ), although ANOVA did not establish any significant effect of the treatment (Table  3 ). Net photosynthesis was negatively correlated with  L  S  in control trees ( R  2  = 0.15,  P  = 0.03), but the relationship lacked in the humidification treatment ( P  = 0.23). We found no differences in  L  S  with respect to soil water status in any treatment separately (Fig.  8 C).

Results from ANOVA models describing the effect of tree size (i.e. the value of the respective parameter before the start of the growing season,  C t   −1 ), treatment ( T ), plot and soil water potential ( Ψ  S_mean ,  Ψ  S_Q25 ,  Ψ  S_Q75 ) on the growth parameters.  The sap flux density in hybrid aspen trees changed considerably compared with that at the same experimental site in previous summers ( Kupper  et al.  2011 ;  Tullus  et al.  2012 a  ).  F  in control plots was significantly greater than that in the humidification treatment during the rainy summer of 2009 ( Kupper  et al.  2011 ). The same tendency (not significant) was observed in the drier summer of 2010 ( Tullus  et al.  2012 a  ). However, our current results demonstrate higher (although not statistically significant) sap flux densities in trees growing in the humidification plots (Fig.  4 ). The canopy conductance to water vapour in the  H  treatment was greater ( P  &lt; 0.05) across the whole study period. This discrepancy is attributable to relatively low soil water potential in the control treatment owing to the very dry summer:  Ψ  S  did not rise over −80 kPa in July. The total precipitation during the 2011 growing season (May–October) was 261 mm (Fig.  1 ), 42 % less than the average of the three previous years (452 mm). As the air humidity manipulation did not affect sapwood-to-leaf-area ratio (HV), the ∼30 % greater leaf area of control trees was responsible for greater transpirational water losses causing faster depletion of soil water reserves and a greater decline in  Ψ  S  despite lower overall sap flux densities in  C  plots (Fig.  4 A and B).  The response of canopy conductance to changes in VPD did not vary between the treatments, suggesting that stomatal sensitivity to atmospheric evaporative demand was not affected by the experimental manipulation. In contrast to that,  g  C  decreased much faster in response to falling  Ψ  S  in the  H  treatment than in the control (Fig.  5 ). The differential response of  g  C  to decreasing soil water availability is probably mediated by plant hydraulic conductance ( Cohen and Naor 2002 ;  Domec  et al.  2009 ). Hydraulic measurements performed on aspen trees in 2010 revealed that both soil-to-branch and leaf hydraulic conductances expressed per unit leaf area were smaller in humidified trees, although growing in moister soil (A. Sellin, unpubl. res.). Under conditions of soil water deficit the lower hydraulic capacity probably becomes a crucial factor for  H  trees, limiting leaf water supply and inducing a steep decline in canopy conductance. Furthermore, an experiment with silver birch revealed that a rapid water deficit in  H  plants led to a faster decrease in hydraulic conductance—responsible for liquid water supply—compared with the decrease in  g  s , which limits water losses, and exposed plants to a greater risk of dehydration ( Sellin  et al.  2014 ).  Lowering  A  n  and  g  s  and increasing IWUE are typical responses to water stress in plant species with a drought avoidance strategy. When plants encounter a soil water deficit, abscisic acid (ABA) is synthesized in the roots and translocated to the leaf through the transpiration stream ( Assmann and Shimazaki 1999 ); higher concentrations of ABA in leaves drive mechanisms leading to a decrease in  g  s  and an increase in WUE ( Liu  et al.  2005 ).  Pantin  et al.  (2013)  propose that ABA promotes stomatal closure in two ways—via its widely known biochemical effect on guard cells and via an indirect hydraulic effect through a decrease in leaf hydraulic conductance. Maintaining stable gas exchange attributes during drought development means that a plant either possesses a drought tolerance strategy or lacks adaptations with respect to drought.  Populus tremula , one of the parent species, is known to act as a drought avoider ( Possen  et al.  2011 ). In our case, the lack of variation in gas exchange characteristics in  C  plots with respect to soil water status (Fig.  6 ) and modification of gas exchange in  H  plots by altering water availability can be explained by the lower  Ψ  S  values in the  C  treatment (i.e. long-term effects mediated by ABA).  Regardless of the difference in  Ψ  S  between the treatments, there was still an effect of the humidity manipulation on  g  s sat  and IWUE (Table  3 ). In fact, the differences in leaf gas exchange between the  C  and  H  plots are attributable to the combined effects of soil water availability and increased atmospheric humidity. As such, our first hypothesis is supported by the experiment: growing at higher RH increases stomatal conductance in trees while lowering photosynthetic WUE (Table  2 ), while the effect is largely mediated by changes in soil water status.  Soil water potential influenced both  V  C max  and  J  max  in hybrid aspen (Table  3 ).  Grassi  et al.  (2005)  found a positive relationship between  V  C max  and  Ψ  S  in oak and ash trees during summer, as in hybrid aspen in this study. A simulation by  Grassi and Magnani (2005)  indicated that 30–40 % of the biochemical limitation could be attributed to a reduction in leaf nitrogen content during droughty summers. Plant photosynthetic capacity and leaf N content expressed per leaf area are positively correlated ( Grassi  et al.  2005 ;  van de Weg  et al.  2012 ). Previous work at the FAHM experimental site has shown that rising RH reduces the water flux in silver birch ( Kupper  et al.  2011 ) and alters the nutritional status of leaves, leading to a decline in photosynthetic capacity ( Sellin  et al.  2013 ). In this experiment, humidification increased rather than decreased water flux through the trees (Fig.  4 ), which explains why the biochemical capacity of photosynthesis was unaffected by the manipulation, but by changes in  Ψ  S  (Table  3 ). The second hypothesis concerning reduced photosynthetic capacity of leaves due to the expectedly smaller N uptake in humidified trees remained unconfirmed. The absence of an impact of air humidity manipulation on photosynthetic machinery of hybrid aspen was also supported by chlorophyll fluorescence measurements performed in the droughty summer of 2012 (A. Niglas, unpubl. res.).  High RH can affect stomatal sensitivity by changing stomatal morphology: plants grown at higher RH have larger stomata that close to a lesser extent when leaves dry ( Giday  et al.  2013 ). In addition, long-term acclimation to high RH during growth increases heterogeneity in stomatal response characteristics to short-term exposure to stomatal closure-inducing factors ( Nejad and Van Meeteren 2005 ). Experiments showing differences in stomatal sensitivity and morphology between plants grown at high and low RH have been carried out under stable/controlled environmental conditions. The conditions before a leaf is fully expanded are important determinants on whether stomatal closure capacity is affected by leaf dehydration and RH. Moreover, the degree of stomatal adaptation in expanding leaves depends on the duration and timing of the exposure to high RH ( Fanourakis  et al.  2011 ). The present study was performed under field conditions with natural diurnal fluctuations of RH; misting was applied when ambient RH was &lt;75 % and could be increased to as much as 18 % (versus 60 and 95 % of RH in  Fanourakis  et al.  2011 ). Our data suggest that stomatal sensitivity to atmospheric VPD remained unaffected in saplings of hybrid aspen. Although we did not explore stomatal dimensions, we presume that differences in morphology and the putative morphological effect on stomatal sensitivity were rather minor as our trees grew  in natura , in both diurnally and seasonally variable environments, under conditions requiring flexible stomatal adjustment.  The findings that stomatal conductance decreases and photosynthesis increases with rising external CO 2  level are well-known phenomena (reviewed by  Araújo  et al.  2011 ). A steeper  A  n  response to  C  a  in  H  plots is attributable to higher stomatal conductance (evidenced by  g  s max ) due to leaf development under lower VPD (Table  2 ). This is indirectly confirmed also by the negative correlation between  A  n  and  L  S  in the  C  treatment.  Initial intrinsic water-use efficiency responded more sensitively to  C  a  in  C  plots than in  H  plots (Fig.  7 ), testifying once more to the effect of elevated atmospheric humidity on leaf gas exchange. Because high IWUE is advantageous to plants under drought conditions, a slower response in high-RH-grown trees to changing ambient conditions may be disadvantageous in the case of abrupt climatic fluctuations becoming more frequent in the future ( Easterling  et al.  2000 ); these plants are not able to adjust their water use as quickly as plants grown in drier air and experience greater water loss. Thus, our results support the third hypothesis on the capacity of plants to modify WUE under changing environmental conditions, albeit not directly tested with respect to air humidity.  The above-ground growth response of aspen trees to humidification in 2011 demonstrated some trends in contrast to those observed in previous years ( Tullus  et al.  2012 a  ). However, the positive effect of humidification was detectable only in current-year height increments, while overall dimensions remained smaller in  H  plots, where hybrid aspen trees had grown slower than in  C  plots in the two previous experimental years ( Tullus  et al.  2012 a  ). The inverse growth response is also attributable to dry weather conditions prevailing in summer 2011. Generally  Ψ  S  or experimental plot was the more significant factor influencing tree growth response than humidity manipulation. One must take into account that the two factors— Ψ  S  and treatment—are partly interrelated, as transpirational flux through trees was lower in  H  plots (Fig.  4 A; see also  Kupper  et al.  2011  and  Tullus  et al.  2012 a  ) and more water was retained in the soil (Fig.  2 ). However, the humidity manipulation also had an impact on growth when considering the effect of  Ψ  S ; thus, the humidification effect on tree growth was clearly not due solely to altered soil water availability. In average or rainy years, when soil water does not limit growth, lowered transpiration hinders nutrient uptake by trees in  H  plots ( Tullus  et al.  2012 a  ), especially for nutrients migrating to the roots with mass flow in soil. Under these conditions increased atmospheric humidity does not improve the growth rate of hybrid aspen.  Sellin  et al.  (2013)  also showed that humidification treatment lowers the photosynthetic capacity and growth rate of silver birch in moist summers. In dry years, when soil water availability limits growth, the impact of this mechanism is obviously irrelevant.  The current study demonstrates that higher air humidity mitigates the effect of low soil water availability on broadleaved trees during dry years by reducing stomatal limitation to photosynthesis, allowing higher net photosynthetic rates and supporting higher growth rates (relative height growth). At the same time, higher RH increases the sensitivity of canopy conductance to water deficit and reduces the responsiveness of IWUE to factors inducing stomatal closure. The present and our earlier results ( Tullus  et al.  2012 a  ;  Sellin  et al.  2013 ,  2014 ) imply that a future rise in atmospheric humidity at high latitudes may be disadvantageous in evenly rainy/humid years and expose trees to a higher dehydration risk during weather extremes, although mitigating the impact of soil water deficit under moderate drought.
