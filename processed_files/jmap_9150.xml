Ultrasensitive microchip sensor based on boron-containing polyfluorene nanofilmsA fluorene-based π-conjugated copolymer with on-chain dibenzoborole units was used in the development of a nanocoated gold interdigitated microelectrode array device which successfully detects fluoride in a broad range of concentrations (10^−11 – 10^−4 M) in aqueous solution, upon impedance spectroscopy measurements. A calibration curve obtained over this range of concentrations and a new analytical method based on impedance spectroscopy measurements in aqueous solution is proposed. The sensor nanofilm was produced by spin-coating and diagnosed via spectroscopic ellipsometry, AFM, and electrically conductivity techniques. Changes in the conductivity due to the boron–fluoride complex formation seem to be the major mechanism behind the dependence of impedimetric results on the fluoride concentration.
