A preliminary molecular phylogeny of the Sigalphinae (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), including Pselaphanus Sz√©pligeti, based on 28S rDNA, with descriptions of new Afrotropical and Madagascan Minanga and Malasigalphus speciesMinanga phoebea sp. n. Quicke, from Uganda, and Malasigalphus roa sp. n. Sharkey, from Madagascar, are described and illustrated. The new species of Minanga displays a distinct posterior metasomal carina and thus provides another example of the co‚Äoccurrence of this feature with a metasomal carapace within the Braconidae. Malasigalphus roa is the second species of the genus recently described by Achterberg and Austin. A preliminary molecular phylogeny of the Sigalphinae is presented including the rare Neotropical genus Pselaphanus the placement of which has been debated. Sensitivity analysis to multiple alignment parameters was conducted and a single elided data set, based on the combined 21 separate alignments, was analysed. Strong support was obtained for the following relationships: Pselaphanus+(Malasigalphus+(other Sigalphinae)), (Minanga+(Sigalphus bicolor+(S. irrorator+S. gyrodontus))), and Earinini being basal (as a grade in these analyses) to other Agathidinae. The Mesocoelus group of genera (Mesocoelini in part) are shown to be derived agathidines rather than being associated with the Orgilini. The Microtypinae is shown be non‚Ämonophyletic and Plesiotypus Achterberg is proposed as the sister group to the Agathidinae+Sigalphinae clade. The Acampsohelconinae does not appear as monophyletic; however, the placements of both of the two included genera, Afrocampsis and Canalicephalis, had less than 100% support in the elised analysis tree, and therefore monophyly of this recently redefined subfamily must be more rigorously tested.
