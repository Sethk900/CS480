Corrigendum: Global analysis of urban surface water supply vulnerability (2014 Environ. Res. Lett. 9 104004)Abstract Salem, Oregon was inadvertently included in the analysis, but it does not meet the study threshold population of 750 000 people. This reduces the number of cities in this study from 71 to 70. Changes to figure 1, and tables 1, 2 and 3 as well as the text are shown below. The changes do not affect the overall results or conclusions.
