Surface areas of calcium carbonate in soilsIn 24 calcareous soils derived from Jurassic limestone in southwest England (Sherborne series), the specific surface areas of the carbonate component were an inverse hyperbolic function of the percentage of CaCO3 they contained, and ranged from 16 to about 5 500 m2/g. The surface areas of three samples of Jurassic oolitic limestone varied from 1.0 to 1.5 m2/g, so weathering processes had greatly increased the specific surface areas of calcium carbonate in these soils. The total surface areas of calcium carbonate were a slightly inverse and linear function of the percentage of CaCO3, and ranged from 4.0 to 8.5 m2/g soil.
