Why is the lawn buzzing?Abstract Graminoids, including grasses, are frequently described in the botanical literature as being wind-pollinated. This paper offers visual evidence for insect pollination of a grass. Three of the bees involved were found to have 100% grass pollen in their pollen sacs. In reviewing the literature for this paper, it was evident that those working with bees are well aware that these insects often pollinate graminoids. It is not clear why this information has not been incorporated into the botanical literature.
