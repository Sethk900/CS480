Assessing chick survival of sage-grouse in Canada. Final project report for 2000.The Alberta greater sage-grouse population has declined by 66-92% over the last thirty years. Previous research in Alberta suggested that the population has declined as a result of poor recruitment. Low levels of recruitment appear to be linked to poor chick survival as a result of limited mesic sites important for brood rearing habitat. Due to the inaccuracies of brood flushing counts, and the limits of technology to produce transmitters small enough for chicks, it has been difficult to accurately assess and understand chick survival. A population model developed from data gathered in 1998 and 1999 suggested that the population would decrease in 2000, resulting in a decrease in the number of males observed on leks from 140 to 132. I counted 140 males at leks in 2000, suggesting that the population remained relatively stable, at between 420 and 622 individuals. While sample sizes were small, measures of productivity in 2000 were quite low compared to previous years, suggesting a better understanding of the variability in the parameters in the model is needed. I also performed a 2-stage pilot experiment, focusing on attaching transmitters to sage-grouse chicks. I first practiced the technique by suturing transmitters to 10 chicken chicks, and then tested the technique on 4 sage-grouse chicks in the field. The transmitters did not appear to harm the chicks at all, and none of them showed signs of infection, bleeding, or scaring from the transmitter attachment. This technique appears to be a viable method for assessing chick survival.
