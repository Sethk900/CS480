Rotational Scanning Electron Micrographs (rSEM): AÂ novel and accessible tool to visualize and communicate complex morphologyAbstract An accessible workflow is presented to create interactive, rotational scanning electron micrographs (rSEM). These information-rich animations facilitate the study and communication of complex morphological structures exemplified here by male arthropod genitalia. Methods are outlined for the publication of rSEMs on the web or in journal articles as SWF files. Image components of rSEMs were archived in MorphBank to ensure future data access. rSEM represents a promising new addition to the toolkit of a new generation of digital taxonomy.
