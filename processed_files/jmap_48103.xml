The vocal repertoire of Myrmeciza loricata (Lichtenstein, 1823) (Aves: Thamnophilidae)The vocal repertoire is a tool that can be used to support systematics, conservation, ecology and behavioural studies. We characterize the acoustic parameters of the vocal repertoire of the white-bibbed antbird (Myrmeciza loricata) and describe the possible functions of each vocalization. The maleâ€™s song is related to territorial defence, and we found three calls in the repertoire. Call I is an alarm call, and call II is used for mutual recognition and remaining in contact with one another. Call III was emitted when the animals were foraging and when the individuals of the couple were very near to each other. Males and females sing as a duet, and their songs were individually distinct. The duet is possibly related to maintaining the pair bond, synchronizing breeding and warning potential intruders of the mated condition of the pair. This work is the first to describe the vocal repertoire of the white-bibbed antbird.
