A new species of the genus Nanosesarma (Crustacea: Decapoda: Brachyura: Sesarmidae), and redescription of Nanosesarma jousseaumei (Nobili, 1906), including new records from the Persian GulfA new species of sesarmid crab from the Persian Gulf, Nanosesarma sarii n. sp. is described. Further, a poorly known species, N. jousseaumei (Nobili, 1906), is recorded from the Persian Gulf and recognized as a valid species. N. sarii n. sp. is allied to N. minutum (De Man, 1887) and N. jousseaumei (Nobili, 1906), but is easily distinguishable from them through a number of characters, in particular the upper surface of the palm with a longitudinal granular ridge, the upper surface of the movable finger fully covered with tubercles, and abdomen of the male with the sixth segment wide and the seventh segment remarkably elongate. N. jousseaumei differs from its remaining congeners in having a large gap between the cheliped fingers, a large tubercle proximally on the outer surface of the movable finger, and large teeth on the posterior margin of the merus of the walking legs.
