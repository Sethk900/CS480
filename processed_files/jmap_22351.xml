Molecular data support placement of Cameronia in Ostropomycetidae (Lecanoromycetes, Ascomycota)Abstract The phylogenetic position of the Tasmanian endemic genus Cameronia Kantvilasis studied using partial sequences of nuclear LSU and mitochondrial SSU ribosomal DNA. Monophyly of the genus is supported, as is its placement in Ostropomycetidae, although its position within this subclass remains uncertain. Given the lack of close relatives to Cameronia and its morphological differences compared to other families with perithecioid ascomata in Ostropomycetidae, the new family Cameroniaceae Kantvilas & Lumbsch is proposed.
