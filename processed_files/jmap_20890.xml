A review of the Western Australian keeled millipede genus Boreohesperus (Diplopoda, Polydesmida, Paradoxosomatidae)Abstract A taxonomic review of the endemic Western Australian millipede genus Boreohesperus Shear is presented in which six species are recognized: the type species, Boreohesperus capensis Shear, 1992, from North-West Cape, one new species, Boreohesperus dubitalis, from Barrow Island and four more new species from the Pilbara region, Boreohesperus curiosus, Boreohesperus delicatus, Boreohesperus furcosus and Boreohesperus undulatus. All six species have highly localized distributions, consistent with being short-range endemics. The nomenclature of the branches of the male gonopod is revised.
