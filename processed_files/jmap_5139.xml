Spatial and temporal distributions of juvenile horseshoe crabs (Arthropoda: Chelicerata) approaching extirpation along the northwestern shoreline of the New Territories of Hong Kong SAR, ChinaJuvenile horseshoe crabs, Tachypleus tridentatus and Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda, with prosomal widths of between 11.5 and 102.5 mm, occur along Hong Kong's northwestern shoreline abutting Deep Bay where dissolved oxygen (DO) has been identified as the principal factor determining distribution and survival. Unreported upon hitherto, however, Tachypleus tridentatus occurred consistently in association with sea-grass (Halophila beccarii) beds, with DO concentrations of 8–14 mg·L−1, a median grain size of >180 μm, interstitial water contents of <36% (sediment wet weight) and organic contents of <3.2% (sediment dry weight). Most individuals occurred between 60 and 120 m down from the shoreline although there appeared to be a trend of down-shore migration in summer, possibly to alleviate thermal stress. No individuals were found at sediment temperatures ≤20°C, i.e. in sub-tropical Hong Kong's winter, when they adopt buried repose. Abundances of emerged T. tridentatus, peaking in November, were synchronized with interstitial salinities of 22–26‰ and averaged 1–2 individuals per 100 m2. Mean population density of T. tridentatus was 4–9 individuals per 100 m2. Only four individuals of C. rotundicauda were found in August and September, suggesting a recent dramatic decline in numbers. The natal crèche environment for juvenile horseshoe crabs in Hong Kong is deteriorating and threatening their survival.
