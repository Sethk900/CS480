Diet of Adenomera thomei (Almeida and Angulo, 2006) (Anura: Leptodactylidae) from a rubber tree plantation in southern Bahia, BrazilThis work describes the diet of a population of Adenomera thomei from a rubber tree plantation within the Atlantic Rainforest of Brazil. Individuals were measured and treated with a stomach flushing method. We assessed the correlation between morphometric aspects and stomach contents and compared electivity with the available invertebrate fauna in the leaf litter. The most important item in the diet was Formicidae. We found 2.48 prey items per stomach. Electivity was highest for isopods. We conclude that A. thomei is a sit-and-wait forager that, despite feeding mainly on ants, cannot be considered an ant specialist because it selects other prey items present in their environment.
