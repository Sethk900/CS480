Rissoidae (Mollusca: Gastropoda) from northeast Atlantic seamountsThe gastropod family Rissoidae is revised at the species level for the Lusitanian seamounts, situated between Portugal and Madeira, and the Meteor group of seamounts, situated south of the Azores in the northeast Atlantic Ocean. Based on material obtained by dredging and trawling, 48 species are reported, of which 30 are described as new. There is very little overlap between the assemblages found on both groups of seamounts, with only two shared species. On the Lusitanian seamounts, 24 species were collected. Seven species (six with planktotrophic development) are shared with the mainland shelf or slope and are represented in low numbers. Eleven species are endemic to this seamount group as a whole and of these, three account for 75% of individuals. Of the species not shared with the mainland, only one is found on the four seamounts, eight (three new) are found on two or three seamounts and/or neighbouring islands, and six (all new) are endemic to a single seamount. On the Meteor group, 26 species were found, of which five are shared with the Azores and 20 (all new) are endemic to the seamount group as a whole. Most species are found on only two or three seamounts, whereas nine species are endemic to only one of the seamounts, and of these five are concentrated on Atlantis seamount. Eight endemic species of the Meteor group included in Porosalvania n. gen. have very different shapes and occupy discrete bathymetric intervals, but are best interpreted as a local radiation originating from a relatively old colonization of this seamount group. The endemic species, and among them the successful ones, all have a paucispiral protoconch denoting nonâ€planktotrophic development. As in the Macaronesian archipelagos, the Rissoidae are the most speciesâ€rich molluscan family on the northeast Atlantic seamounts.
