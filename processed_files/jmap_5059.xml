The marine fauna and flora of the Isles of Scilly. Tanaidacea (Crustacea: Peracarida)Records of Tanaidacea from the Isles of Scilly are collated; the published literature is reviewed, together with unpublished records from various sources. These data are supplemented by recent material collected in the archipelago between 2001 and 2010. A total of 10 species are now known from littoral and sublittoral habitats of the Isles. These records include the first published record for the British Isles of the tanaid Zeuxo holdichi, the known distribution of which is summarized. The apseudomorph Apseudopsis latreilli is common to abundant on littoral sandflats but Apseudes talpa generally replaces this species on more heterogeneous substrata and sublittorally. Tanais dulongii and Leptochelia savignyi are present throughout the archipelago among littoral algal-turf with embedded sediment. Zoogeographically, the list includes species from the temperateâ€“boreal and, mainly, from Lusitanian waters.
