Diversity Relationships among Taxonomic Groups in Recovering and Restored Forests.Our objective was to reexamine the definition and use of surrogates in biodiversity studies of disturbed ecological communities. To this end, we examined diversity and community structure in recovering (pollution damaged) and restored (via liming, fertilizing, seeding, and planting) forests in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence zone near Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. The relationships among taxonomic groups were determined using correlations between Shannon diversity and species richness. We used correspondence analysis to quantify the contribution of taxonomic groups to diversity and community structure. We detected useful surrogates in the naturally recovering forests but not in restored forests. In the former, vascular plant diversity was significantly correlated with nonvascular plant diversity and reflected community structure in the total plant community. Our results suggest that it may be important to restore and conserve diversity relationships rather than simply diversity levels because the relationships may be better indicators of ecosystem health or function.
