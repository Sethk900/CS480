Feeding habits of the endemic tropical parthenogenetic lizard Cnemidophorus nativo (Teiidae) in a restinga area of northeastern BrazilThe population of Cnemidophorus nativo in the restinga of Guaratiba, Bahia State, Brazil, is carnivorous with a diet consisting predominantly of insect larvae and termites, which is similar to that of other cnemidophorines. The absence of seasonal variation in diet may be a consequence of the availability of termites throughout the year. The small size of the termites and the ease with which both juveniles and adults eat larvae independent of their length were probably the cause of the poor relationship between lizard body measurements and mean number and volume of prey consumed.
