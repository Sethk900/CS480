Decomposition of maize straw in three European soils as revealed by DRIFT spectra of soil particle fractionsDiffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform (DRIFT) technique was used to investigate decomposition of maize straw residues in particle-size fractions of three European soils in a 1-year incubation experiment that simulated both incorporation and mulching practices. The aliphatic bands in the 2920–2860 cm−1 regions were used to derive decomposition curves and mineralization rates of maize residues. Evaluation of soil organic matter changes by DRIFT in particle-size fractions depended on soil texture and soil aggregate stability. Decomposition could be followed over the full incubation period only in three size-fractions of the silty German soil because of its intermediate aggregate stability. DRIFT spectra were not useful in the least stable sandy Danish soil and in the most stable clayey Italian soil. Decomposition rates derived from DRIFT results were similar to those obtained by isotopic techniques. DRIFT spectroscopy may represent a rapid and accurate method to follow fresh organic matter degradation directly in soil matrix or particle-size fractions in some soils provided that adequate soil dispersion is obtained.
