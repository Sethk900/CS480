Daytime bedsite selection by the texan white-tailed deer in xerophyllous brushland, North-eastern Mexico.The importance of the characteristics of the diurnal bedsites used by male and female deer (Odocoileus virginianus texanus) in hot (> 40 Â°C), dry (< 400 mm rainfall per year) semiarid zones with xerophyllous brushland was analyzed. From December 1997 to October 1998, on six occasions, seven-km-long random transects were surveyed on horseback on different periods and days during three different days to locate resting deer at the San Francisco Ranch (1000 ha) in north-eastern Mexico. The habitat variables measured at 50 bedsites and 50 random sites were shrub species, height, volume, thermal cover and protection cover, as well as herb and grass cover. Males selected bedsites with greater total cover, volume and shrub height than females did, with a preference for mesquite and sweet acacia shrubs. There were seasonal differences in site selection, and shrub height and volume were greater during the postreproductive season (dry season), although the number of species was lower in the bedsites. During the fawning season, females chose bedsites with greater concealment cover (0-50 and 50-100 cm). Conservation strategies should take into account that deer select bedsites with specific characteristics, and shrubs are important elements in their habitat.
