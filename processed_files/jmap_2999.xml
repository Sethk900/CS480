Positive effects of native shrubs on three specially protected cacti species in Durango, MexicoThe spatial association between the specially protected cacti Coryphanta durangensis, Echinocereus longisetus and Peniocereus greggii and potential nurse plants was evaluated, as was their relative position to the sun under the crown of the latter in the southern Chihuahuan Desert. The soil temperature under potential nurse plants was lower than under direct sunlight. There was more nitrogen and organic matter in the soil under Prosopis laevigata trees than in soil under direct sunlight. There were 68 plants of C. durangensis, 59 plants of E. longisetus and 157 of P. greggii. Only one individual of C. durangensis and one of E. longisetus grew outside the shade of the crown of other plants. Echinocereus longisetus was not associated with any particular species, but grew more often than expected by chance in the northern segment of the crown (i.e. the area most shaded in the afternoon). Coryphanta durangensis and P. greggii grew more often under P. laevigata than expected by chance. The effect of other plants, and P. laevigata in particular, on the facilitation of growth of protected cacti species should be considered in management plans of the Chihuahuan Desert, where mesquite (P. laevigata) is often harvested for charcoal production.
