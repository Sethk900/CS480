Effect of burial on the germination of Opuntia tomentosa's (Cactaceae, Opuntioideae) seeds.Opuntia tomentosa seeds have physiological dormancy and a permeable but hard funicular envelope that restricts water uptake and embryo growth. Dormancy break, germination, and changes in the funiculus were compared in laboratory-stored seeds and in those buried for 7 months at different microsites and later exhumed and stored in the laboratory. The funicular envelopes of both lots were examined with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Seeds in both lots were: scarified with H2SO4 (0, 45, 60 and 90 min), treated with gibberellins (0, 1000 and 2000 ppm) and germinated at the same ages (0, 2, 4, 7, and 10 months after exhumation) at 24 째C. Light effect was determined at 24 째C and 20-35 째C. In laboratory-stored seeds germination was low. Exhumed seeds germinated in ~50%, the remaining ones required scarification and gibberellins, but lost dormancy two months later. Gibberellins reduced germination heterogeneity, and scarification reduced germination; the adverse effect of scarification was offset by gibberellins. Exhumed seeds germinated mainly in darkness at 20-35 째C and partially in far red light at both temperatures. SEM showed that fungi eroded the funiculus reducing its resistance. O. tomentosa could form a seed bank, ensuring its survival under heterogeneous environments.
