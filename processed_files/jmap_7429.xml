Biological data and Otolith (Sagitta) morphology of Polyprion americanus and schedophilus griseolineatus (Osteichthyes, Serranidae and Centrolophidae)Summary Morphometrical data, feeding habits, sexual maturity stage, weight and otolith morphology of Polyprion americanus (Serranidae) and Schedophilus griseolineatus (Centrolophidae) are given based on a relatively large number of specimens captured in the Argentine sea during a research trip aboard the R/V â€œOrient Maru Iâ€;. Temperature and depth for each station are recorded and the relationships of the studied species with others in the area commented. A detailed synonymy and a full bibliography are added. Current knowledge of the biology of both species is scarce.
