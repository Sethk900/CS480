Simulation Study on the Influence of Roughness on the Downstream Automatic Control of an Irrigation CanalAbstractThe controllability of an irrigation canal depends on its physical characteristics, on the control algorithm used, and on the actual condition of the canal in relation to the algorithm tuning conditions. The flow conditions and controllability in an irrigation canal may change if the hydraulic friction changes. Great variations in friction were observed in an irrigation canal in Spain owing to the presence of Rhizoclonium hieroglyphicum, a type of algae that grows in clear water. Such large variations in friction may have a significant effect on the stability and performance of automatic canal controllers. Using the unsteady-state model Simulation of Irrigation Canal (SIC), the influence of roughness on the performance of the study canal under distant downstream control of its four coupled pools was investigated. A set of proportional-integral (PI) controllers was tuned for different values of Manning's n. The controllerâ€™s performance under real conditions is sensitive to the roughness conditions under which the control gains were tuned, and a method to robustly tune the gains of the PI controllers is proposed.
