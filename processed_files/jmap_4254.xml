A New Scolopocryptopid Centipede from Northeastern Brazil (Chilopoda: Scolopendromorpha)A new species of centipede, Scolopocryptops piauhyensis sp. n., is described from Piauí State, northeastern Brazil. It is the only species in this genus known to occur in the ‘caatinga’ biome. The new species is related to S. inversus (Chamberlin, 1921) and S. ferrugineus (Linné, 1762) but differs primarily in the short, high dental plates of the coxosternum, the wider ultimate sternite, and the smaller pore field on the coxopleuron of the ultimate segment.
