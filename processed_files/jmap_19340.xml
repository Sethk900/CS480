The effects of fertilization on soil respiration in 2-year-old Pinus taeda L. clonesFertilization is a common, cost-effective method to increase productivity of managed forests in the southeastern United States; however, little is known about how fertilization will affect the processes that drive total soil CO2 efflux (F-S) and ultimately net ecosystem productivity (NEP). The objective of this research was to intensively monitor the response of F-S, and its respiratory components during the first year after N and P fertilization in Pinus taeda clones. We monitored F-S, heterotrophic respiration (R-H), and specific root respiration (R-R) and found that F-S in fertilized plots differed significantly (P < 0.0001) from that in unfertilized plots, but the direction of this effect was dependent on date. Additionally, R-H was consistently lower (P=0.0001) in fertilized plots relative to control plots, but the magnitude was dependent on the sampling date, and R-R significantly (P=0.04) increased in fertilized plots (+20%) when averaged over the study. Increased R-R and decreased R-H were probably offsetting each other, resulting in no overall difference in F-S 1 year after fertilization. If these short-term trends persisted over the rotation of the stand, increased gross primary productivity accompanied by no change or even a decrease in soil C evolution could result in increased NEP.
