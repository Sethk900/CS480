The type material, taxonomy and conservation of Horniman's Swallowtail, Papilio hornimani (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae)The taxonomy of the East African swallowtail Papilio hornimani is reviewed, with special reference to the three currently recognized subspecies described from the Usambara Mts (P. h. hornimani), Udzungwa Mts (P. h. mwanihanae) and the Oldeaniâ€Mbulu massif (P. h. mbulu), all located in Tanzania. The primary type material is illustrated, and type localities are established, notably with respect to the original source for P. h. hornimani, collected at Magila, Mlinga Forest area, East Usambara mountains. Populations from the Chyulu Hills (Kenya) and Mts Meru and Kilimanjaro (Tanzania), placed here with P. h. mbulu, appear to represent further potential segregates, or clinal variation. Prospects for conservation of the Mlinga Forest population are briefly discussed.
