Restoration of a Cirsio-Molinietum Fen Meadow on an Agriculturally Improved PastureThe objective of this study was to identify soil nutrient availability\nconditions that would allow the establishment of key species of the\nMolinia caerulea-Cirsitum dissectum fen meadow. The restoration site was\na species-poor agriculturally improved pasture that had received no\ninorganic fertilizer for greater than 13 years. Treatments designed to\nreduce site fertility included: cutting and removal of herbage,\ncultivation, fallowing and topsoil removal. Straw and/or lignitic-clay\nwere incorporated as soil amendment treatments. Cirsio-Molinietum\nspecies were either sown or planted as seedlings on treated plots.\nNeither soil nitrogen nor potassium availability, per se, appeared to\nlimit the establishment of Cirsio-Molinietum species, whereas enhanced\nphosphorus availability did. Removal of the top 15-20 cm of soil reduced\nthe total soil phosphorus amount by about 85 percent and depleted plant\nP availability. Nutrient-poor and relatively calcium-enriched soil\nexposed by topsoil removal allowed the development of a community with\naffinities to the Cirsio-Molinietum typical fen meadow. Redundancy\nanalysis indicated the existence of marked vegetational gradients within\nthe topsoil removal treatments that were influenced by the straw and the\nlignitic-clay amendments. The way in which these two amendments\ninfluenced edaphic conditions were unclear. Where the topsoil was not\nremoved the vegetation became dominated by a few competitive species and\nalthough many of the planted Cirsio-Molinietum species were still\npresent after four years, they were found only in trace amounts. Removal\nof most of the soil organic matter was a practical success in that it\ncreated suitable edaphic conditions for all the planted\nCirsio-Molinietum species to remain well established.
