Preserving Biodiversity: Species, Ecosystems, or Landscapes?Efforts to preserve biological diversity must focus increasingly at the ecosystem level because of the immense number of species, the majority of which are currently unknown. An ecosystem approach is also the only way to conserve processes and habitats (such as forest canopies, belowground habitats, and hyporheic zones) that, with their constituent species, are poorly known. Continued concern with species is essential, however. Landscape-level issues also need much greater attention. Designing an appropriate system of habitat reserves is one landscape- level concern. Understanding and appropriately manipulating the landscape matrix is at least equal in importance to reserves issues, however, since the matrix itself is important in maintaining diversity, influences the effectiveness of reserves, and controls landscape connectivity.
