Phylogenetic relationship between the nine species of  Eleusine  was investigated based on RFLP of the seven amplified chloroplast genes/intergenic spacers,  trn K gene sequence and cpSSR markers. The maternal genome donor ( E. indica , 2n=2x=18) of the allotetraploid (2n=4x=36, 2n=2x=38)  Eleusine  species, and the phylogenetic relationships between cultivated  E. coracana  (2n=4x=36) and wild species have been successfully resolved. The species-specific markers were also identified. The explicit identification of the maternal parent and that of the immediate wild progenitor of finger millet will be immensely useful for future genetic improvement and biotechnological program(s) of the crop species.  Assessment of phylogenetic relationships is an important component of any successful crop improvement programme, as wild relatives of the crop species often carry agronomically beneficial traits. Since its domestication in East Africa,  E  leusine coracana  (2 n  = 4 x  = 36), a species belonging to the genus  Eleusine  ( x  = 8, 9, 10), has held a prominent place in the semi-arid regions of India, Nepal and Africa. The patterns of variation between the cultivated and wild species reported so far and the interpretations based upon them have been considered primarily in terms of nuclear events. We analysed, for the first time, the phylogenetic relationship between finger millet ( E. coracana ) and its wild relatives by species-specific chloroplast deoxyribonucleic acid (cpDNA) polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP) and chloroplast simple sequence repeat (cpSSR) markers/sequences. Restriction fragment length polymorphism of the seven amplified chloroplast genes/intergenic spacers ( trn K,  psb D,  psa A,  trn H– trn K,  trn L– trn F,  16 S and  trn S– psb C), nucleotide sequencing of the chloroplast  trn K gene and chloroplast microsatellite polymorphism were analysed in all nine known species of  Eleusine . The RFLP of all seven amplified chloroplast genes/intergenic spacers and  trn K gene sequences in the diploid (2 n  = 16, 18, 20) and allotetraploid (2 n  = 36, 38) species resulted in well-resolved phylogenetic trees with high bootstrap values.  Eleusine coracana ,  E. africana ,  E. tristachya ,  E. indica  and  E. kigeziensis  did not show even a single change in restriction site.  Eleusine intermedia  and  E. floccifolia  were also shown to have identical cpDNA fragment patterns. The cpDNA diversity in  Eleusine multiflora  was found to be more extensive than that of the other eight species. The  trn K gene sequence data complemented the results obtained by PCR–RFLP. The maternal lineage of all three allotetraploid species (AABB, AADD) was the same, with  E. indica  being the maternal diploid progenitor species. The markers specific to certain species were also identified.  The wild relatives of crop species often carry beneficial alleles that are effective against various biotic and abiotic stresses. They hold the key to successful crop improvement programmes through introgression of desired genes from wild to cultivated crop species ( Dida and Devos 2006 ). In this context, the assessment of phylogenetic relationships at the inter-specific level and the identification of gene pools are considered important. Based on chloroplast deoxyribonucleic acid (cpDNA) diversity, we obtained information on the molecular phylogeny of finger millet ( Eleusine coracana)   vis-à-vis  its wild relatives.  The genus  Eleusine  is a member of the tribe Eragrosteae, subfamily Chloridoideae and the family Poaceae. It is a small genus of nine species, which includes six diploid (2 n  = 2 x  = 16, 18, 20) and three polyploid (2 n  = 4 x  = 36, 38) species ( Bisht and Mukai 2002 ;  Liu  et al.  2011 ). These species are widely distributed in the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia and South America ( Phillips 1972 ). East Africa is considered to be the centre of diversity for the genus ( Bisht and Mukai 2002 ).   Eleusine coracana  (2 n  = 4 x  = 36), commonly known as finger millet or ragi, is the only economically important species of the genus. After sorghum and pearl millet, finger millet ranks third in cereal production in the semi-arid regions of the world ( Bisht and Mukai 2002 ). It is widely cultivated in the arid and semi-arid regions of East Africa, India, Nepal and many other Asian countries for its grain and fodder value ( Verma 2009 ). The grain is widely used for preparing bread, cakes, soup, puddings, porridge and fermented beverages ( Hilu and deWet 1976 ;  Chandrashekar 2010 ;  Neves 2011 ). Finger millet is a rich source of essential amino acids and polyphenols, and it has comparatively higher levels of calcium and iron than other known cereals ( Barbeau and Hilu 1993 ;  Chandrashekar 2010 ). It has a number of medicinal properties as well, particularly in controlling blood sugar levels in diabetic patients ( Duke and Wain 1981 ;  Chandrashekar 2010 ;  Pradhan  et al.  2010 ).  Plant materials used in the present study.  a Dr. Mathews M. Dida, Kenya; USDA, United States Department of Agriculture, USA; ILRI, International Livestock Research Institute, Ethopia; NBPGR, National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources, India.  b  Bisht and Mukai (2002 ).  In spite of the enormous amount of information, there still exists considerable disagreement over the identification of the diploid ancestors of the three polyploid species and the level of speciation and evolutionary relationships among the nine species of  Eleusine  ( Phillips 1972 ,  1995 ;  Hilu and Johnson 1997 ;  Lye 1999 ;  Bisht and Mukai 2000 ,  2001 a  ,  2002 ;  Devarumath  et al.  2005 ;  Neves  et al.  2005 ;  Liu  et al.  2011 ).  Eleusine coracana  (2 n  = 4 x  = 36) (AABB) is considered to be an allotetraploid and has been domesticated from its wild progenitor,  Eleusine africana  (2 n  = 4 x  = 36) (AABB) ( Chennaveeraiah and Hiremath 1974 ;  Hilu and deWet 1976 ;  Hilu  et al.  1978 ;  Hilu 1988 ,  1995 ;  Hiremath and Salimath 1992 ;  Werth  et al.  1994 ;  Hilu and Johnson 1997 ;  Bisht and Mukai 2000 ,  2001 a  ,   b  ;  Devarumath  et al.  2005 ;  Neves  et al.  2005 ;  Dida  et al.  2007 ,  2008 ). The genetic maps generated by  Dida  et al.  (2007)  showed that  E. coracana  and  E. africana  are allotetraploids. There is also strong evidence to suggest that  Eleusine indica  (2 n  = 2 x  = 18) (AA) is the maternal genome donor of  E. coracana  and  E. africana  ( Hilu 1988 ;  Hiremath and Salimath 1992 ;  Hilu and Johnson 1997 ;  Bisht and Mukai 2000 ,  2001 a  ;  Neves  et al.  2005 ).  Bisht and Mukai (2000 ,  2001 a  ,  2002 ) indicated that  Eleusine floccifolia  (2 n  = 2 x  = 18) could be the BB donor species of  E. coracana . This has, however, been refuted by others ( Hiremath and Salimath 1992 ;  Neves  et al.  2005 ;  Devarumath  et al.  2010 ;  Liu  et al.  2011 ). According to these authors, the BB genome donor species remains unidentified and may possibly be extinct.  Eleusine kigeziensis  (2 n  = 4 x  = 36 or 38) (AADD) is the third tetraploid species of the genus.  Eleusine indica  (2 n  = 2 x  = 18) (AA) and  E. jaegeri  (2 n  = 2 x  = 20) (DD) are proposed to be the wild progenitors of  E. kigeziensis  ( Bisht and Mukai 2002 ;  Devarumath  et al.  2010 ). On the contrary,  Neves  et al.  (2005)  proposed  E. kigeziensis  to be autotetraploid, with  E. indica  being closely related to  E. kigeziensis  but not the direct genome donor to  E. kigeziensis .  Liu  et al.  (2011)  have concluded that all three tetraploids ( E. coracana, E. africana and E. kigeziensis ) are of allotetraploid origin. They suggested independent origins of  E. kigeziensis  and  E. africana — E. coracana . They are of the view that both events may have involved the diploids  E. indica  and  E. tristachya  as maternal parents, but the paternal parents remain unidentified.  Eleusine indica  and  E. tristachya  are considered to be very similar and the degree of relationship between the two remains unresolved ( Hiremath and Chennaveeraiah 1982 ;  Hiremath and Salimath 1991 ;  Hilu and Johnson 1992 ;  Werth  et al.  1994 ;  Bisht and Mukai 2001 a  ,   b  ;  Neves  et al.  2005 ;  Liu  et al.  2011 ).  In the present study, the cpDNA restriction site pattern variation of seven amplified chloroplast genes/intergenic spacers, the chloroplast  trn K gene sequence and cp microsatellite polymorphism were investigated for the first time in all nine  Eleusine  species, with the objective of constructing the phylogeny of the genus  Eleusine  and identifying the maternal genome donors of the polyploid species including  E. coracana . Both direct sequencing of the  trn K gene and polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP) of cpDNA regions and chloroplast simple sequence repeats (cpSSRs) are considered to be very good markers for detecting cpDNA variation. The chloroplast  trn K gene (which also contains the  mat K gene within the  trn K gene intron) sequence has been effectively used for the construction of grass phylogenies ( Hilu and Alice 1999 ;  Hilu  et al.  1999 ). The  mat K gene sequence is one of the seven loci widely utilized for the DNA barcoding of plants ( Babbar  et al.  2012 ). Specific chloroplast genes and/or intergenic spacers can be amplified ( Taberlet  et al.  1991 ;  Demesure  et al.  1995 ;  Tsumura  et al.  1995 ,  1996 ;  Dhingra and Folta 2005 ;  Heinze 2005 ). The amplicons can be directly sequenced or restriction endonuclease digested (PCR–RFLP or cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence), and the occurrence of microsatellites (cpSSRs) in the chloroplast genome has been widely utilized for species identification, reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships, taxonomic studies and the identification of maternal parents in polyploids ( Tsumura  et al.  1995 ,  1996 ;  Weising and Gardner 1999 ;  Ishii and McCouch 2000 ;  Lakshmi  et al.  2000 ;  Parani  et al.  2000 ,  2001 ;  Komatsu  et al.  2001 ;  Provan  et al.  2001 ;  Kishimoto  et al.  2003 ;  Nwakanma  et al.  2003 ;  Zhu  et al.  2003 ;  Asadi Abkenar  et al.  2004 ,  2008 ;  Van Droogenbroeck  et al.  2004 ;  Ibrahim  et al.  2007 ;  Angioi  et al.  2008 ;  Sehgal  et al.  2008 ;  Jena  et al.  2009 ;  Liu  et al.  2011 ;  Poczai  et al.  2011 ).  Seeds of the  Eleusine  species and one outgroup species ( Dactyloctenium aegyptium ) utilized in the present study were obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) (Beltsville, MD, USA), the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia), Dr Mathews M. Dida (Maseno University, Maseno, Kenya) and the National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR) (New Delhi, India). The accession numbers and source of the seed material are given in Table  1 . The seeds were grown under controlled conditions in the experimental field of the Department of Botany, University of Delhi.  The total genomic DNA of the  Eleusine  species and  D. aegyptium  was isolated from fresh young leaves using the cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide method as described by  Murray and Thompson (1980)  with some modifications. Instead of a CsCl–ethidium bromide ultracentrifugation step, the DNA was purified by phenol–chloroform extraction.  List of chloroplast genes/intergenic spacers amplified in the present study.  a Sizes in source.  Seven genes and intergenic spacers amplified from the chloroplast genome were separately restricted with 31 four-, five- and six-base cutter restriction endonucleases (AluI, AvaI, AccI, AfaI, BamHI, BalI, BglI, BglII, ClaI, DraI, EcoRV, EcoRI, HaeIII, HinfI, HindIII, HincII, MspI, KpnI, MboI, MluI, PstI, PvuII, SacI, SalI, SpeI, SphI, SmaI, SspI, TaqI, XhoI and XbaI). The 12.20 μL reaction mix contained 10 μL of the amplified gene product, 1.2 μL of enzyme buffer and 10 U of the restriction enzyme. After gentle mixing the mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C (except for TaqI, which was incubated at 60 °C). The digestion was terminated by adding 1.5 μL of 10× loading buffer. The digested products were fractionated on 1.5 % agarose gels containing ethidium bromide (0.05 μg mL −1 ) in 0.5× TBE buffer. A DNA ladder mix was loaded alongside the digested products to serve as size markers. After agarose gel electrophoresis, the gel was photographed in ultraviolet light. Reproducibility of the patterns was tested by repeating all the reactions at least twice.  For PCR–RFLP analysis, the presence (1) or absence (0) of a restriction fragment was recorded. Total and mean character differences between pairs of species were calculated using PAUP* 4.0 ( Swofford 2002 ). Nei and Li's coefficient of genetic distance ( Nei and Li 1979 ) was calculated between each pair of species after the optimality criterion was set to DISTANCE. Cluster analysis was carried out using the unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages (UPGMA) ( Sneath and Sokal 1973 ) and neighbour-joining (NJ) ( Saitou and Nei 1987 ) methods. Bootstrap values were calculated from 100 replicates using the BOOTSTRAP command in PAUP.  The  trn K gene was amplified from the nine  Eleusine  species and one outgroup as described above. The amplification products were separated on a 1 % agarose gel, excised from the gel and purified using a QIA quick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany). The purified amplification products were cloned and sequenced with an ABI PRISM 377 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). BLAST similarity searches were performed using the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BLASTN algorithm to confirm the identity of the  trn K sequences. The nucleotide sequences have been submitted to GenBank with accession numbers KF357736–KF357745. The nucleotide sequence of the partial  trn K gene from  Acrachne racemosa  available in GenBank (accession number JN681616.1) was also utilized for phylogenetic analysis. The consensus sequence for the  trn K gene from the nine  Eleusine  taxa and one outgroup ( D. aegyptium ) was generated using the software CLC Sequence viewer 6.1.  The sequences were aligned using Clustal-X, version 1.8 ( Thompson  et al.  1997 ). Phylogenetic analyses were carried out with the software MEGA 5 ( Tamura  et al.  2011 ). Pairwise sequence divergence rates between species were calculated using the maximum composite likelihood method. Phylogeny construction was carried out using NJ, minimum evolution (ME), maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony (MP) methods. Neighbour-joining and ME trees were obtained using the maximum composite likelihood criterion while ML and MP trees were constructed using the nearest-neighbour-interchange (NNI) and tree-bisection-reconnection algorithms, respectively. In all the analyses, all positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset (complete deletion option). Support values of the internal branches of NJ, ME, ML and MP trees were evaluated by bootstrap (500 replicates).  List of chloroplast microsatellites amplified in the present study.  An equal volume (10 mL) of formamide dye (98 % formamide, 10 mM EDTA, 0.026 g of bromophenol blue, 0.026 g of xylene cyanol) was added to each amplified product. The samples were heated for 5 min at 94 °C and immediately placed on ice. A total of 2.5 mL of each sample was loaded on a 6 % polyacrylamide gel (19 : 1 acrylamide : bisacrylamide, 7.5 M urea and 1× TBE buffer), and electrophoresis was conducted at 55 W and 55 °C for ∼2 h.  For silver staining, the gel was fixed in 10 % (v:v) acetic acid for 30 min. It was subsequently rinsed three times in de-ionized water (2 min per rinse). The gel was then kept for staining for 30 min in a 2 L solution containing 2 g of silver nitrate and 3 mL of 37 % formaldehyde (Promega, USA). The stained plate was rinsed with de-ionized water for 20 s and developed in a prechilled (10 °C) developer (2 L) solution containing 60 g of sodium carbonate, 3 mL of 37 % formaldehyde and 400 µL of sodium thiosulfate (10 mg mL −1 ). When bands became visible, the gel was immediately transferred to 10 % acetic acid solution to stop further reaction. The gel was finally rinsed with distilled water and air dried.  The PCR products of eight primer–template combinations were characterized by direct sequencing. A PCR was performed in 100 µL volumes as described above. An aliquot of the PCR product was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the remainder was purified through a QIA quick PCR clean up kit (Qiagen). Nucleotide sequencing was performed using an ABI PRISM 377 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The nucleotide sequences have been submitted to GenBank with accession numbers KF357730–KF357735.

Unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages dendrogram based on the restriction fragment data of amplified chloroplast gene/intergenic spacers. Numbers at the nodes represent bootstrap probability values out of 100 replicates.  The  trn K gene codes for tRNA-Lys UUU . In rice, the chloroplast  trn K gene is 2576 bp long, of which the exon is only 72 bp long. The exon is divided into two parts by a long intron of ∼2500 bp. The 5′ exon consists of 37 bp and the 3′ exon consists of 35 bp. The  mat K gene, which codes for maturaseK, is 1536 bp in length and is located within the chloroplast  trn K intron. In the present study, the  trn K gene was sequenced from the nine  Eleusine  species and  D. aegyptium . The aligned  trn K gene sequence of  Eleusine  corresponded to position 45 at the 5′ end to position 2531 at the 3′ end of rice. The length of the  trn K gene in the nine  Eleusine  species ranged between 2463 ( E. jaegeri ) and 2467 bp ( E. tristachya  and  E. floccifolia ). The length of  trn K in  A. racemosa  and  D. aegyptium  was 2466 and 2472 bp, respectively  [see   Supporting Information   ] . The GC content of the  trn K gene sequence varied from 32.3 to 33 % with an average of 32.6 %. The nucleotide frequencies were 0.162 for G, 0.164 for C, 0.324 for A and 0.350 for T. The dataset including alignment gaps and missing data comprised 2486 nucleotide positions, out of which 2254 were conserved, 214 were variable and 57 were parsimony informative sites.

Numbers at the nodes represent bootstrap probability values out of 500 replicates.  The robustness of the present data lies in the fact that the dendrograms based on ME, ML and MP analysis showed almost the same topology as that of the NJ tree (Fig.  4 ). Maximum parsimony analysis resulted in most parsimonious trees (Fig.  4 C) with a tree length of 232. The bootstrap consensus tree had a consistency index of 0.943, a retention index of 0.859 and a rescaled consistency index of 0.811.  Silver-stained polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns generated by ccmp5 (A) and ccmp6 (B) in  E. coracana  (1),  E. africana  (2),  E. tristachya  (3),  E. indica  (4),  E. floccifolia  (5),  E. intermedia  (6),  E. kigeziensis  (7),  E. multiflora  (8),  E. jaegeri  (9) and  D. aegyptium  (10). The size of the fragments in base pairs is indicated on the left.  Nucleotide sequences of cpDNA of  E. coracana  amplified using six cpSSR primer pairs. The location of repeats is underlined.  The restriction site variation identified in the amplified chloroplast gene/intergenic spacers has provided new insights into the origin and evolution of the three polyploid species, and the genetic relationships between the cultivated and wild  Eleusine  species. Species-specific markers were also identified. None of the amplicon–enzyme combinations could discriminate between  E. coracana  (AABB, 2 n  = 4 x  = 36),  E. africana  (AABB, 2 n  = 4 x  = 36),  E. tristachya  (AA, 2 n  = 2 x  = 18),  E. indica  (AA, 2 n  = 2 x  = 18) and  E. kigeziensis  (AADD, 2 n  = 4 x  = 38) on the one hand, and between  E. floccifolia  (BB, 2 n  = 2 x  = 18) and  E. intermedia  (AB, 2 n  = 2 x  = 18) on the other hand. Although the maximum number of polymorphic and phylogenetically informative markers was obtained in eight  trn K amplicon–enzyme combinations, the amount of variation that can be tapped with the PCR–RFLP method was lower than the variation tapped with sequencing of the  trn K gene. A total of 214 SNPs were found in the  trn K gene sequence, of which only 10 were causative to 8 polymorphic profiles. This clearly demonstrates that sequencing of the  trn K gene is more informative than the PCR–RFLP method. Moreover, the nucleotide sequence of the chloroplast  trn K gene fine-tuned the species relationships. The nine species of  Eleusine  were grouped into two clades, in both PCR–RFLP and  trn K gene sequence data analyses. The  trn K sequence data clearly showed that the three tetraploids were closer to  E. indica  than to  E. tristachya , as concluded from PCR–RFLP data.  The present observations based on restriction site variation and the  trn K gene sequence of cpDNA are congruent with the conclusions reached by various authors based on the multiple marker nuclear DNA assay, chloroplast markers and chromosome research. The strong affinities between  E. coracana ,  E. africana  and  E. indica  have been highlighted in earlier studies ( Hilu and Johnson 1992 ,  1997 ;  Hilu 1995 ;  Bisht and Mukai 2000 ,  2001 a  ,   b  ;  Neves  et al.  2005 ;  Dida  et al.  2007 ,  2008 ;  Liu  et al.  2011 ) as well. A number of studies based on chromosome research ( Hiremath and Chennaveeraiah 1982 ;  Hiremath and Salimath 1991 ), 2C DNA content ( Hiremath and Salimath 1991 ), crossability data ( Salimath  et al.  1995 b  ) and ribosomal DNA polymorphism ( Hilu and Johnson 1992 ;  Werth  et al.  1994 ;  Bisht and Mukai 2000 ), ITS sequence data ( Neves  et al.  2005 ) and cpDNA ( Hilu and Johnson 1997 ;  Neves  et al.  2005 ;  Liu  et al.  2011 ) also support the close affinity between  E. indica  and  E. tristachya . The allotetraploid  E. kigeziensis  exhibits the same maternal lineage as that of the two other allotetraploid species,  E. coracana  and  E. africana . The five species share some common morphological features, such as 1–3 nerved lower glumes with a winged keel, 3–7 nerved upper glumes with a more or less winged keel, the presence of 1–3 subsidiary nerves adjacent to the central nerve of the lemma and the generally winged keel of the palea ( Phillips 1972 ).  The present data unambiguously support the view of  Chennaveeraiah and Hiremath (1974) ,  Hilu (1988) ,  Hiremath and Salimath (1992) ,  Hilu and Johnson (1997) ,  Bisht and Mukai (2000 ,  2001 a  ,   b  ) and  Neves  et al.  (2005)  that  E. africana  is the wild progenitor of the cultivated species,  E. coracana , and that  E. indica  is one of the diploid progenitors of the two polyploid species ( Liu  et al.  2011 ). The present results further indicate that  E. indica  with the AA genome might be the maternal parent for all three tetraploid species, viz.  E. coracana ,  E. africana  and  E. kigeziensis.  Morphologically,  E. kigeziensis  resembles  E. indica . It is considered to be a hybrid between  E. indica  and one of the perennial species ( Phillips 1972 ).  Salimath (1990)  and  Bisht and Mukai (2002)  have also proposed  E. indica  as one of the genome donors of  E. kigeziensis .  The close affinity in the cpDNA PCR–RFLP profiles and  trn K sequences between  E. floccifolia  and  E. intermedia  is also supported by the occurrence of the same chromosome number (2 n  = 18), 2C DNA values ( Hiremath and Chennaveeraiah 1982 ;  Hiremath and Salimath 1991 ) and ITS sequence data ( Neves  et al.  2005 ). Close association between  E. jaegeri ,  E. floccifolia  and  E. intermedia  suggested in earlier studies ( Hiremath and Salimath 1991 ;  Hilu and Johnson 1992 ;  Liu  et al.  2011 ) is further supported by our data.  Eleusine jaegeri  in all combinations grouped together with  E. floccifolia  and  E. intermedia  except in the  psa A–MspI combination, where it shows a unique profile  vis-à-vis  the remaining species. In the case of  trn K sequence analysis also these three species are found to be closely associated.  Eleusine multiflora  also behaves in the same fashion. The species exhibits unique profiles  vis-à-vis  the remaining species in  trn K–DraI,  trn K–MspI,  trn K–SpeI,  psa A–TaqI and  psb D–HaeIII combinations, with the result that it represents the most diverged taxon among all the  Eleusine  species. These amplicon–enzyme combinations can therefore be used as species-specific markers for  E. jaegeri  and  E. multiflora . The position of  E. multiflora  within the genus  Eleusine  is questionable mainly on the basis of its unusual inflorescence morphology [considered to be intermediate between  Eleusine  and  Acrachne  ( Phillips 1972 ;  Clayton and Renvoize 1986 )], distinct chemical composition ( Hilu  et al.  1978 ), molecular data ( Hilu and Johnson 1992 ;  Hilu 1995 ), chromosome number (2 n  = 16), 2C DNA value and other cytogenetic features ( Mysore and Baird 1997 ;  Bisht and Mukai 2000 ) including the present results.  Dactyloctenium aegyptium  in restriction site analysis, and  A. racemosa  and  D. aegyptium  in  trn K sequence analysis indicate that they are the most diverged species  vis-à-vis   Eleusine  species analysed and thus represented as outgroups.  Chloroplast microsatellites are known to have potential for phylogenetic studies ( Powell  et al.  1995 a  ,   b  ,  1996 ;  Provan  et al.  1997 ,  2001 ;  Ishii and McCouch 2000 ;  Angioi  et al.  2008 ). The present cpSSR data on  Eleusine  species, however, were not helpful as very little polymorphism was obtained for various amplified microsatellites. Only two cpSSR loci (ccmp2 and ccmp5) were found to be polymorphic, displaying a total of four alleles. In the case of ccmp2, the variant allele was found in  E. tristachya , while for ccmp5 the variant allele was found in  E. jaegeri . Overall, the sequences seem to be highly conserved. This is in strong contrast to the observations made in the other genera such as  Glycine ,  Oryza  and  Hordeum , where different species within the genus and even within different subspecies displayed characteristic haplotypes ( Powell  et al.  1995 b  ,  1996 ;  Provan  et al.  1997 ,  1999 ). The reason for not obtaining polymorphism in the present study could be attributed to the fact that it is very difficult to design universal primers for microsatellites that show widespread polymorphism at the inter-specific level and at the same time are able to amplify across a broad range of plant genera. Although there are primers available that amplify across wide-ranging taxa, these rarely show widespread inter-specific polymorphism. This could be due to the contrasting requirements in a short stretch of DNA of extreme stability and sequence conservation for priming sites and consistently high levels of polymorphism in the intervening region ( Provan  et al.  2001 ). Second, size homoplasy may not necessarily mean identical intervening microsatellite regions; it may also be due to variation in flanking regions. It is also possible that back mutations have taken place, which might result in identical size but not identical sequence ( Bryan  et al.  1999 ).  Our results based on RFLP of the seven amplified chloroplast genes/intergenic spacers, and the  trn K gene sequence in the nine diploid and allotetraploid  Eleusine  species and two outgroup species resulted in well-resolved phylogenetic trees. The maternal genome donor ( E. indica , 2 n  = 2 x  = 18) of the allotetraploid (2 n  = 4 x  = 36, 2 n  = 2 x  = 38)  Eleusine  species, and the phylogenetic relationships between cultivated  E. coracana  (2 n  = 4 x  = 36) and wild species could be successfully resolved. The species-specific markers were also identified. The two diploid species  E. indica  and  E. tristachya  could not be resolved separately by PCR–RFLP of seven chloroplast genic/intergenic spacers, as not a single site change could be scored. However, the  trn K gene sequence clearly demonstrated that  E. indica  is more closely related to all three allotetraploids as compared with  E. tristachya . Therefore,  E. indica  is most likely the maternal parent to all three allotetraploids.  Eleusine multiflora  (2 n  = 2 x  = 16) was found to be the most diverged among all the species. The explicit identification of the maternal parent and that of the immediate wild progenitor of finger millet will be immensely useful for future genetic improvement and biotechnological programmes of the crop species.
