Callibaetis Eaton (Ephemeroptera: Baetidae) from BrazilCallibaetis Eaton remains poorly known in South America. Some of the species in the genus are difficult to identify with confidence and most are known only at the adult stage. In this paper we increase the number of species known to occur in Brazil from 11 to 18; diagnoses of species are improved; five new species are described based on nymphs and reared adults of both genders (C. calloventer sp. nov., C. cruentus sp. nov., C. gelidus sp. nov., C. itannae sp. nov., C. nigracyclus sp. nov.); first records of two species are reported from Brazil (C. gonzalezi and C. sellacki); descriptions of unknown stages are made (C. gonzalezi male imago and C. jocosus nymph); redescriptions of known stage are provided for male and female imago of C. jocosus. Based on these data, keys for nymph, male and female imago are proposed for Brazil. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:019D55A5-8979-4D9A-BB16-CB1451C8DF1B
