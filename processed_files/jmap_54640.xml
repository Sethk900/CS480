Relation between phosphorus fractions and development of soils from Galicia (NW Spain)The relationship between soil development and the distribution of P among its fractions in the surface horizons of native soils in Galicia (NW Spain) was studied. P forms were determined by sequential fractionations and the fractions were regrouped as slow-turnover and rapid-turnover organic and inorganic forms. In soils developed on siliceous rock, an accumulation of slow-turnover organic P (sonic-NaOH-extractable organic P) is accompanied by an increase in rapid-turnover inorganic P (resin-extractable P+bicarbonate-extractable inorganic P) and a decrease in slow-turnover inorganic P (NaOH∓sonic-NaOH∓HCl-extractable inorganic P), that could be due to destruction of inorganic P-adsorbing complex. In soils developed on carbonate-bearing rock, slow-turnover organic P declined and rapid-turnover organic P (bicarbonate∓NaOH-extractable organic P) increased. These trends are explained in terms of soil processes.
