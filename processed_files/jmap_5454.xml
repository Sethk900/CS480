Contrasting modes of handling moss for feeding and caseâ€building by the caddisfly Scelotrichia willcairnsi (Insecta: Trichoptera)Finalâ€instar larvae of the microcaddisfly, Scelotrichia willcairnsi sp. nov. (Trichoptera: Hydroptilidae) were discovered feeding on a moss, Platyhypnidium muelleri in northâ€eastern Queensland. Not only do the larvae feed on the moss, but their cases are constructed from fragments of moss leaves. Microscopic examination of larval guts and cases showed a total contrast in the angle at which the moss leaves are cut for each purpose: for cases the moss leaves are cut longitudinally, in parallel with the length of the cells, whereas for feeding the leaves are cut perpendicular to the leaf margin, across the cells, presumably an adaptation that releases the cell contents for digestion. The new caddisfly species is described based on the adult males. Scelotrichia willcairnsi represents the first Australian record of the Southâ€east Asianâ€New Guinean Stactobiini genus Scelotrichia.
