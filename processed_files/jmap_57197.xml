Municipal Wastewater Sludge Stabilization and Treatment Using Electrochemical Oxidation TechniqueAbstractThe objective of this research was to investigate, at the laboratory scale, the performance of an electrochemical process for enhancing dewaterability and stabilizing wastewater sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plants. This process has the advantage of simultaneous disinfection and odor removal from sludge. The equipment consisted of a 12-L cylindrical electrolytic cell containing a Ti/RuO2 anode and Ti cathode. Current intensities varying from 5.0 to 10 A were tested in the absence and presence of the electrolytes H2SO4 [10–27  kg/ton of dry matter (tDM)] and NaCl (88–354  kg/tDM). Best performance with respect to sludge treatment and stabilization was obtained when the electrolytic cell was operated for 60 min at 8.0 A, with energy consumption of 856  kWh/tDM, in the presence of 177 kg NaCl/tDM and 23.3  kg  H2SO4/tDM. The electrochemical treatment induces particles to agglomerate and enhances the filterability of wastewater sludge during dewatering in the presence of the cationic polymer Percol 789 (2.5  kg/tDM). The process was efficient in increasing the dryness of sludge. A 6 to 10% increase in total solids in dehydrated sludge was expected. The electrochemical process was also found to be effective in removing indicator pathogens (abatement>4–5 log units of total and fecal coliforms) and unpleasant odors. At the same time, it preserved the fertilizing properties of the sludge by maintaining concentrations of inorganic nutrients (total phosphorus and total Kjeldahl nitrogen) and organic matter (chemical oxygen demand) in dewatered sludge.
