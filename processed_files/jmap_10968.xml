MAID: a model to simulate UT/LS aerosols and ice cloudsThe comprehensive model MAID (model for aerosol and ice dynamics) was developed to simulate condensation and freezing in aerosol particles residing in the UT/LS (upper troposphere/lower stratosphere). The exact balancing of trace gas components is a particular emphasis of MAID. MAID is applied to and verified by experiments in the aerosol chamber AIDA, and, moreover, it is adapted to Lagrangian atmospheric cirrus cloud simulations. Here, the model is introduced, and as an example for model applications the significant influence of homogeneous or heterogeneous freezing on ice cloud microphysics and the water and nitric acid partitioning in cirrus clouds is shown.
