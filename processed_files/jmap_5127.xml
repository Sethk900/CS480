Contributions to the knowledge of the genera Haemerophygus Baudi, 1876 and Ceratanisus Gemminger, 1870 (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae: Ceratanisini) in the Anatolian regionPreviously known species of the genus Ceratanisus Gemminger, 1870 are studied, based on a comparison of specimens. This study is a first attempt to scrutinize the composition of this poorly known genus, as a preliminary approach to the tribe Ceratanisini Gebien, 1937. As a result of this study three previously described taxa are recognized as valid species and three new species from Turkey, Ceratanisus selimi sp. nov., Ceratanisus labriquei sp. nov. and Ceratanisus andiberti sp. nov., are described. A key for the separation of the genera of Ceratanisini is presented, including the new species described herein.
