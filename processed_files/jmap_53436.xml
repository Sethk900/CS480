Stockpiled Forage Yield and Nutritive Value of Summer-Dormant and Summer-Active Tall Fescue in a Marginal EnvironmentStockpiled forage for grazing during fall and winter can reduce winter feed costs for livestock producers. Tall fescue is used successfully as stockpiled forage in areas of the Midwest and Southeast. In the Southern Great Plains, drought conditions limit production, resulting in summer-active variety stand failure and summer-dormant variety persistence. This study compared the stockpiled production and nutritive value of summer-dormant type to summer-active type tall fescue [Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) Darbysh.]. The yield and nutritive value of stockpiled summer-dormant tall fescue were similar to that of summer-active tall fescue. At the end of the study, severe drought occurred in the area, resulting in summer-active failure but summer-dormant persistence.
