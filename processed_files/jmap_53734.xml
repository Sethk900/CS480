Forage Performance in Crop–Livestock Systems Designed to Reduce Water Withdrawals From a Declining Aquifer•In the semiarid Texas High Plains, integrating crops with grazing systems could conserve irrigation water and increase perennial grassland.  •We combined irrigated and nonirrigated exotic and native grasses with cotton production.  •We grazed and hayed the grasses, harvested grass seed, and harvested cotton.  •Strategically combining different forages, fertilizer, and water inputs can extend the grazing season, improve the quality of available forage, and provide a buffer against moderate drought.  •Nonirrigated, seeded native grass mixtures can provide valuable grazing and decrease total water use of an integrated crop-livestock system.
