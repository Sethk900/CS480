Redescription of Macrolaimus crucis Maupas, 1900 (Nematoda: Rhabditida: Chambersiellidae) from Spain, with scanning electron microscopy study and a compendium of the genusIberian material of Macrolaimus crucis, the type species of its genus, is described and illustrated based on light micropscope and scanning electron microscope observations. It is characterized by its body length, 654–863 μm in females and 654–767 μm in males; labial sensilla six conical setae forward directed; stoma nearly as long as wide (9–13 × 6–11 μm), with cheilostome slightly longer than gymnostome and cheilorhabdia and gymnorhabdia well developed; pharyngeal corpus 1.6–2.4 times isthmus length, with slightly swollen metacorpus; excretory pore located at isthmus level; female reproductive system prodelphic, lacking postvulval uterine sac; tail of both sexes conical (46–61 μm, c = 13.1–15.1, c′ = 3.1–4.0 in females, 38–48 μm, c = 14.6–17.2, c′ = 2.0–2.6 in males), ending in an acute and weakly bent dorsad tip, and phasmids at 60–70% of tail length; spicules 26–38 μm long; and gubernaculum 10–13 μm long. Iberian material is compared with type material and other known populations. The taxonomy of the genus is revised, including an emended diagnosis, an updated list of species, a key to their identification and a compendium of their morphometrics and diagnostic features.
