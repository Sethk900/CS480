Deer Browsing, Forest Edge Effects, and Vegetation Dynamics Following Bottomland Forest Restoration.Vegetation composition and forest stand development are frequently mediated by browsing herbivores. These relationships have received little attention in a forest restoration context even though White-tailed deer (<em>Odocoileus virginianus</em>) is likely to influence these agriculture, forest, and restored ecosystem mosaic landscapes. Tree species composition, herbaceous vegetation, and deer browsing patterns were assessed 5 and 7 years following bottomland hardwood forest restoration on a 526-ha site in the Cache River watershed in southern Illinois, United States. Light-seeded tree species (<em>Fraxinus pennsylvanica</em>, <em>Acer negundo</em>, <em>Liquidambar styraciflua</em>, and <em>Platanus occidentalis) </em>of volunteer origin dominated the woody vegetation component, with especially high stocking and density near existing forest cover and potential seed sources. At more distant locations, presumably planted <em>Quercus </em>spp. were more likely to dominate and were the only tree species found in 15% of plots in year 7. <em>Quercus </em>stocking increased over the course of the study, constituting 7% of trees during year 7. Deer herbivory was associated with reduced stem height and disproportionately impacted seedlings of <em>Quercus palustris </em>and <em>Celtis </em>spp. Our results suggest that deer browsing influences forest stand composition and density as a function of distance from the nearest forest edge. Herbaceous vegetation had little impact on early stand development. Continued spread of the exotic and invasive <em>Lonicera japonica </em>and potential mortality of <em>F. pennsylvanica </em>due to an anticipated Emerald ash borer (<em>Agrilus planipennis</em>) epidemic, combined with low stand density and delayed canopy closure, may result in persistent overstory gaps and compromise long-term restoration success.
