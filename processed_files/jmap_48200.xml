Use of high-resolution satellite imagery for investigating acid mine drainage from artisanal coal mining in North-Eastern IndiaAcid mine drainage (AMD) is one of the major environmental problems in coal mining districts. The present study explores the potential of high-resolution satellite (HRS) imagery, combined with field-based geochemical sampling, for investigating the AMD-related issues arising from artisanal coal mining activity in a part of North-Eastern India. The HRS imagery available from Indian remote sensing satellites (CARTOSAT-1 and RESOURCESAT-1) and QuickBird are used for this purpose. The study demonstrates that (1) the artisanal 'rat-hole' type coal mines prevalent in the study area can be mapped to a fair extent through merged CARTOSAT-1 PAN and RESOURCESAT-1 LISS-IV imagery; (2) coal mining-induced enhanced dissolution of pyrites appears to be the main mechanism for the occurrence of AMD exacerbating the problem of acid rock drainage (ARD); and (3) HRS imagery can be used to detect iron precipitates on streambeds indicating the presence of AMD.
