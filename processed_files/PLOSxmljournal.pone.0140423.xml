Focusing on tree diversity, soil erosion control, and climate change mitigation through carbon storage, we surveyed vegetation and monitored soil loss in various land-use areas in a northern Bornean agricultural landscape shaped by swidden agriculture, rubber tapping, and logging, where various levels and types of disturbance have created a fine mosaic of vegetation from food crop fields to natural forest. Tree species diversity and ecosystem service production were highest in natural forests. Logged-over forests produced services similar to those of natural forests. Land uses related to the swidden agriculture system largely outperformed oil palm or rubber monocultures in terms of tree species diversity and service production. Natural and logged-over forests should be maintained or managed as integral parts of the swidden system, and landscape multifunctionality should be sustained. Because natural forests host a unique diversity of trees and produce high levels of ecosystem services, targeting carbon stock protection, e.g. through financial mechanisms such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), will synergistically provide benefits for biodiversity and a wide range of other services. However, the way such mechanisms could benefit communities must be carefully evaluated to counter the high opportunity cost of conversion to monocultures that might generate greater income, but would be detrimental to the production of multiple ecosystem services.This study strictly complied with Indonesian laws. Authorizations to carry out research activities were obtained from appropriate sources both at national (Ministry of Forestry and Ministry of State for Research and Technology) and local level (Head of Kapuas Hulu regency). Permissions from local owners to work on their lands were obtained prior to any activity. Sending soil and herbarium samples from the field site to laboratories in Java for further analysis was done after authority approval. We did not collect endangered plants or any animals.The study area is located on the island of Borneo (top left panel), in the Indonesian province of West Kalimantan, in the regency of Kapuas Hulu (bottom left panel). In the main panel, plot location and broad land-use types (LUT) are displayed along with former logging roads (red) and rivers (blue). The black square indicates the location of the village.This site was chosen because of the diversity of land uses representative of northern Bornean traditional agricultural systems that were found within a limited perimeter (ca. 2 km Wâ€“E by 5 km Nâ€“S). Traditionally, the main crop, rice, is cultivated along with other annual crops (such as cassava, maize, etc.) in swiddens from either primary or secondary forest clearing before the plot is abandoned after 1âˆ’2 years of cultivation. Rubber seedlings and saplings, which are planted in some crop fields during the cultivation phase or just after plot abandonment, eventually lead to rubber-based secondary forests (also called â€œjungle rubberâ€ gardens) as a result of plant succession. Past and current uses of land by the local community (swidden agriculture system mixed with rubber gardens) and past logging activities have created a mosaic of vegetation reflecting various disturbance types, ages and intensities in the Keluin area.Indices were computed for each 20 Ã— 20 m plot before being averaged by land-use type (over 25 plots for logged-over and natural forest, and 12 otherwise). Mean values with the same letter are not significantly different (Tukeyâ€™s HSD test on uncorrected values in case no spatial autocorrelation was detected and corrected values otherwise, p &lt; 0.01).Older stands (for rubber gardens and secondary regrowth forest) consistently showed higher index values compared with young ones, but the difference was only significant for mean Fisherâ€™s Î±. For similar time intervals since last disturbance, all the diversity indices were consistently higher in secondary regrowth areas compared with rubber gardens, but the difference was not significant.Each dot (98 in total) represents a 20 Ã— 20 m plot.Means were computed over 12 to 25 replicates per land-use type for aboveground biomass, and over five replicates per land-use type for topsoil. Aboveground biomass (AGB) was split into four fractions according to tree diameter at breast height (Ã˜). Mean values with the same letter (lowercase for aboveground biomass, uppercase for topsoil) are not significantly different (Tukeyâ€™s HSD test on uncorrected values in case no spatial autocorrelation was detected and corrected values otherwise, p &lt; 0.01).For all types of land use, the highest proportions of aboveground carbon were contained in trees with DBH = 10âˆ’30 cm, while the lowest non-null proportions were contained in trees with DBH = 5âˆ’10 cm. Yet, for recently disturbed stands such as those in young secondary regrowth areas, small trees (those with DBH = 5âˆ’10 cm) could represent up to ca. 25% of aboveground carbon.Although natural forests stored on average twice as much carbon in topsoils as other land-use types, significant differences were observed only between natural forests and secondary regrowth areas (both young and old) or old rubber gardens due to high variability within land-use types (for logged-over and natural forests, especially).Each dot (98 in total) represents a 20 Ã— 20 m plot. Horizontal and vertical dashed lines represent median values of species richness (n = 25) and carbon stocks in aboveground biomass (68 Mg C ha-1), respectively. Regression lines (along with standard error) are computed independently for each land-use type. A second-order regression model (best-fit significant model selected among polynomial models with degrees 0 to 3) over the whole data set is also displayed (in black).Data are averaged over the monitoring period (June 2012 to September 2013) and over the different replicates for each land-use type. Values from three replicates (one in young secondary regrowth area, one in young rubber garden, one in logged-over forest) were discarded because they were abnormally high (&gt; two times mean value of the corresponding land-use type). Mean values with the same letter are not significantly different (Tukeyâ€™s HSD test on uncorrected values in case no spatial autocorrelation was detected and corrected values otherwise, p &lt; 0.01).Indicators are normalized so that the minimum possible value of an indicator is at the center of the radial plot and the maximum observed values are on the outer circles (for the service of soil erosion control, the indicator is the inverse of the measured soil loss).Service indicators: Ct = carbon stocks in topsoil; Cb = carbon stocks in aboveground biomass; Sr = tree species richness; Fi = Fisherâ€™s Î±; Bp = Bergerâ€“Parker index; Ec = soil erosion control.In addition to the need to preserve natural forests, another challenge is to maximize service production in human-modified land-use areas. With the noticeable exception of tree species richness and tree species composition, our data did not show significant differences in service production between logged-over forests, old rubber gardens and old secondary regrowth forests. Tree species richness is high in logged-over forests (one plot can simultaneously host a mixture of old growth and secondary species), but in such forests, aboveground carbon stocks are low. In contrast, aboveground carbon stocks can be large in some old rubber gardens and secondary regrowth forests, but tree species richness is low. Beyond the diversity of products from these land-use types, there is a complementarity in services produced by such human-modified landscapes. Despite continuous changes in land use and management, the diversification of human activitiesâ€”farming, rubber tapping, and loggingâ€”ensures the sustained delivery of multiple services.We found that carbon storage and tree diversity increased along a successional recovery of the forest after initial clearance: levels of service production were lowest in food crop fields, intermediate in young rubber gardens and secondary regrowth areas, and highest in old rubber gardens and secondary regrowth forests. More striking was no trend for carbon storage in topsoil and the slow recovery of different ecosystem services, either in old rubber gardens or secondary regrowth forests. Mean time since last disturbance for our old secondary regrowth forest plots was 47 years, and yet species richness was still significantly lower than for natural forests. Similarly, we found low similarity in tree species composition between old secondary regrowth forest and natural forest plots.In such a rapidly transforming traditional rural landscape in northern Bornean, natural forests host highly unique tree species diversity, have the lowest erosion rate, and store significantly more carbon (in aboveground biomass and topsoil) than do any other land-use type. Logged-over forests provide services similar to natural forest, except for soil erosion control, which is jeopardized by the presence of the remaining decaying road network that leads to soil loss at the landscape level.All land uses related to the swidden agriculture system largely outperform oil palm or rubber monocultures in terms of tree diversity, carbon storage, and soil erosion control. Natural and logged-over forests should be maintained or managed as an integral part of the swidden system, and landscape multifunctionality should be sustained as a safety net against the price volatility of traded goods (e.g. rubber, palm oil, timber, tengkawang oil), upon which the economy of monocrop systems is much more dependent.Because of the congruence of services in natural forest, protection of their carbon stocks, for example through financial mechanisms such as REDD+, will synergistically benefit biodiversity and a wide range of other services provided to communities in this area. However, how such mechanisms could benefit communities must be carefully evaluated to counter the high opportunity cost of conversion to monocultures; these may generate greater income, but may also be more detrimental to the production of multiple ecosystem services.Ecosystem service recovery time following initial slash-and-burn practices on the vegetation is longer in the study area than has been reported in the literature for similar study situations. As rotation length appears to be a key factor in the sustainability of swidden systems, it is critical to understand the socio-cultural and economic drivers of the reduction in rotation length and the potential feedback of this reduction on socialâ€“ecological systems. In the rapidly transforming socio-environmental context of this region, questions remain about the long-term persistence of the swidden agriculture system.Rarefaction level was the number of individuals surveyed in old rubber gardens (n = 449). Twelve plots (0.48 ha in total) were surveyed for fallows and rubber gardens (both young and old), and 25 plots (1 ha in total) for logged-over and natural forest.(TIFF)No vegetation plot was selected in food crop fields under the assumption that tree diversity and aboveground carbon would be null. The first plot size dimension is the dimension along the slope.(XLSX)Longitude and latitude of each plot are provided in decimal degrees (WSG84 datum). Plot mean diameter at breast height (DBH), height, wood specific gravity (WSG) and aboveground carbon (AGC) are also provided.(XLSX)Longitude and latitude of each plot are provided in decimal degrees (WSG84 datum). Plot annual soil loss (ASL) and topsoil carbon (TSC) are also provided. ASL values in grey-tinted cells were discarded for analyses.(XLSX)We used original indicator values when the distribution was normal and log<sub>10</sub>-transformed values otherwise. The vegetation set did not include food crop field plots under the assumption that tree diversity and aboveground carbon would be null. Depicted values are either test statistics (for Moranâ€™s I, Lagrange Multiplier and the selected model) or model coefficients, and are presented along with information on statistical significance. For the Berger-Parker index, despite some spatial auto-correlation, the spatial dependence coefficient of the spatial error model was not significant. We therefore used a regular linear model and acknowledge that results for this indicator might be slightly biased due to spatial auto-correlation.(XLSX)(XLSX)We thank all the villagers from Keluin for their hospitality, availability, and precious help in data collection.
