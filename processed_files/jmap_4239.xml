A Key to the Stick-Insect Genera of the 'Anareolatae' of the New World, with Descriptions of Several New Taxa (Insecta: Phasmatodea)A key to the anareolate stick-insect genera (Insecta: Phasmatodea) of the New World (North, Central and South America) is provided. Otocraniella flagelloantennata gen. n. sp. n. and Echetlus fulgens n. sp. are described as new. A new genus, Aplopocranidium gen. n., is erected for Bacteria waehneri (Günther, 1940). Baculum ramosum (Saussure, 1861) is redescribed. New synonyms have been traced during the works on this study. Hypocyrtus (Redtenbacher, 1908) is a subjective junior synonym of Lamponius (Stål, 1875), Steleoxiphus (Rehn, 1907) of Paraleptynia (Caudell, 1904), and both Abrachia (Kirby, 1889) and Ceratiscus (Caudell, 1904) of Baculum (Saussure, 1861). The anareolate tribe Hesperophasmatini is recognized as a member of the Pseudophasmatidae: Xerosomatinae. A new tribe, Paraleptyniini trib n., is introduced to encompass the anareolatae genera Paraleptynia (Caudell, 1904), Xiphophasma (Rehn, 1913) and Parabacillus (Caudell, 1903). A study of egg material showed these taxa to belong into Heteronemiidae.
