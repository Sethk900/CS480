Pilot-Scale Decontamination of Small-Arms Shooting Range Soil Polluted with Copper, Lead, Antimony, and Zinc by Acid and Saline LeachingAbstractThe objective of this study was to evaluate at the pilot scale the performance of a chemical leaching process for Pb, Cu, Sb, and Zn removal from a fine fraction (<125  μm) of soil at two Canadian small-arms shooting ranges (SASR; Batoche: 418 mg Cu/kg, 5,006 mg Pb/kg, 168 mg Sb/kg, and 96 mg Zn/kg; Normandie: 1,015 mg Cu/kg, 6,024 mg Pb/kg, 305 mg Sb/kg, and 177 mg Zn/kg). A comparison of different leaching reagents revealed that the use of H2SO4 (0.125M)+NaCl (4 M) is a very promising option from an economic point of view to solubilize metallic pollutants from highly polluted soils. The results showed that chemical treatment, including three successive acid-leaching steps (0.125MH2SO4+4MNaCl, PD=10%, t=1h, T=20°C) followed by one rinsing step using water [pulp density (PD)=10%, time (t)=15  min, temperature (T)=20°C], resulted in metal removal yields of 93% Cu, 97% Pb, 89% Sb, and 70% Zn in Batoche soil and 85% Cu, 96% Pb, 59% Sb, and 49% Zn in Normandie soil. Subsequently, Sb and other dissolved metals (Cu, Pb, and Zn) were successfully recovered via chemical precipitation/coprecipitation (99.1% Cu, >99.9% Pb, 95.1% Sb, and 99.9% Zn—Batoche; 90.4% Cu, >99.7% Pb, 79.1% Sb, and >99.9%Zn—Normandie) by adding NaOH until pH=9.
