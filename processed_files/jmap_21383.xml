Perlesta ephelida, a new Nearctic stonefly species (Plecoptera, Perlidae)Abstract A new Nearctic species of Perlidae (Insecta, Plecoptera), Perlesta ephelida sp. n., is described from the male, female, and egg stages. This species has been previously reported as, or confused with, Perlesta shubuta Stark from several central and eastern U.S. states. Perlesta ephelida is distinctive from Perlesta shubuta and other regional Nearctic congeners mainly according to male genitalic and egg characteristics. Perlesta ephelida is a widely-distributed eastern Nearctic species, whereas Perlesta shubuta appears to be restricted to a narrow latitudinal belt in the Gulf Coast region from Louisiana east conservatively to the Florida panhandle. The egg of Perlesta shubuta is depicted with scanning electron microscopy for the first time.
