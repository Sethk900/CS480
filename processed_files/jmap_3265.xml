Estimation of greater sage-grouse survival in North Park, ColoradoWe estimated survival rates of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) in North Park, Colorado, USA, from band-recovery data of 6,021 birds banded during spring, 1973-1990, with recoveries through 1993. Average annual adult female survival ((S) over bar = 0.59, SE = 0.011) was greater than average adult male survival ((S) over bar = 0.37, SE = 0.007), and average subadult (<1 yr old at time of banding) female survival ((S) over bar = 0.77, SE = 0.030) was greater than average subadult male survival ((S) over bar = 0.63, SE = 0.034). Four weather covariates (spring and winter precipitation and temperature) did not contribute to predicting annual survival.
