Suitability of two types of plastic covering on mini-tunnels for paprika seedling production in warm areasA trial was conducted at the ARC-Roodeplaat Vegetable and Ornamental Plant Institute to determine the difference between the two types of plastic (clear and opaque) used as covering for mini-tunnels during paprika (Capsicum anuum L.) seedling production. Two cultivars (PapriKing and PapriQueen) were tested in a split-plot experiment, with type of plastic allocated to main plots and cultivar to sub-plots. Tunnels were opened 33 days after planting and seedling survival rates determined. Seed germination tests were conducted in order to eliminate differences in germination between the two cultivars, and temperature sensitivity of the seed during germination was also determined. No differences between cultivars was noted, and both reacted in the same way. Type of plastic used to cover the tunnels significantly affected seedling survival, and position in the tunnel also played a role. Temperatures above 32Â°C during germination had a detrimental effect, resulting in reduced germination and abnormal seedlings. Temperatures below the opaque plastic were lower than those below the clear plastic, and it was concluded that the opaque plastic should be used when temperatures are high.
