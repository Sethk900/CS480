The effects of abiotic and biotic factors on web-decorating behaviour of an orb-weaving spider, Cyclosa octotuberculata Karsch (Araneae: Araneidae)In this study, we investigated the decorating material, frequency, form and total length of web decorations built by an orb-weaving spider, Cyclosa octotuberculata Karsch, and also determined the factors influencing decoration variation in the field. Cyclosa octotuberculata were found to decorate their webs using self-secreted materials such as silk, egg sacs and moults as well as collected materials such as prey remains and various plant debris. Importantly, they were able to respond to abiotic (study site and year) and biotic (developmental stage, web size, type and height) factors by changing their decorating behaviour. Spider size, web type, study site and year significantly affect the decoration length of C.Â octotuberculata. Abiotic factors such as the study site and year, but not biotic factors such as developmental stage, web size and height, had significant effects on the frequency of decorating materials, and decoration shape.
