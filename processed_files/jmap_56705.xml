Mobility of TX100 suspended multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and the facilitated transport of phenanthrene in real soil columnsThe transport behavior of TX100 suspended multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) through different soil columns as well as their effects on the mobility of phenanthrene was systematically studied. Results showed that the mobility of MWCNTs varied with soils, which was found to be correlated positively to the average soil particle diameters and soil sand contents, while correlated negatively to soil clay contents. The retention of MWCNTs on soil columns is most likely due to surface deposition and physical straining. Co-transport of phenanthrene with MWCNTs was tested in three selected soils (soil HB, DX and BJ), where MWCNTs could act as carriers of phenanthrene and enhance the mobility of phenanthrene in soils. However, during passing through the soil columns phenanthrene initially adsorbed onto MWCNTs could be partially â€œstrippedâ€ off. In soil with the lowest phenanthrene sorption affinity and highest water velocity (soil HB), only 8.5% phenanthrene was desorbed during transport, suggesting that a strong MWCNT-associated phenanthrene mobile may occur in this soil. More than 80% of phenanthrene was stripped off in soils with higher sorption affinity (soil DX and BJ), indicating the limitation of the co-transport of phenanthrene and MWCNTs in such soils.
