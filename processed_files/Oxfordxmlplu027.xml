Numerous species have contentious issues surrounding them as they provide both benefits and harm. <italic>Prosopis</italic> taxa are currently naturalised or invasive in 103 countries and are bioclimatically suitable for many more. There are numerous management practices available to control <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasions, each with their benefits and costs, however, in most areas management has had only limited success. There is need for more research to improve understanding and management success and for countries to develop strategic plants to guide managed in the future.Invasive species cause ecological, economic and social impacts and are key drivers of global change. This is the case for the genus <italic>Prosopis</italic> (mesquite; Fabaceae) where several taxa are among the world's most damaging invasive species. Many contentious issues (‘conflicts of interest’) surround these taxa, and management interventions have not yet sustainably reduced the negative impacts. There is an urgent need to better understand the factors that drive invasions and shape management actions, and to compare the effectiveness of different management approaches. This paper presents a global review of <italic>Prosopis</italic>, focusing on its distribution, impacts, benefits and approaches to management. <italic>Prosopis</italic> was found to occur in a 129 countries globally and many more countries are climatically suitable. All areas with naturalized or invasive <italic>Prosopis</italic> species at present are suitable for more taxa and many Asian and Mediterranean countries with no records of <italic>Prosopis</italic> are bioclimatically suitable. Several <italic>Prosopis</italic> species have substantial impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem services, and local and regional economies in their native and even more so in their invasive ranges; others provide multiple benefits to local communities. Management efforts are underway in only a small part of the invaded range. Countries where more research has been done are more likely to implement formal management than those where little published research is available. Management strategies differ among countries; developed nations use mainly mechanical and chemical control whereas developing nations tend to apply control through utilization approaches. A range of countries are also using biological control. Key gaps in knowledge and promising options for management are highlighted.The increased movement of humans around the world has facilitated transportation of many species to environments far from their native ranges. This has been done purposefully—to introduce new crops and horticultural and forestry species—and accidentally, for example as weed seed in grain shipments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C43">Mack 2003</xref>). These introductions have led to the rise of biological invasions that cause substantial ecological, social and economic impacts, and they are one of the key drivers of global change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C92">Vitousek <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C66">Pimentel <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>). However, many alien species have been embraced by humans and are crucial for local livelihoods and national economies through the goods and services they provide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C78">Shackleton <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C39">Kull <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C89">van Wilgen <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>).It is important to understand the dynamics of invasive species to reduce their negative impacts and maximize their benefits, but frameworks linking theory and management for biological invasions are lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C36">Hulme 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C94">Wilson <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>). Management is inefficient in many areas due to lack of knowledge on key aspects of the invasive species. It is crucial to understand the reasons for introductions, uses (benefits), costs, ecology and scales of invasions and to elucidate perceptions and potential contentious issues when creating sustainable management plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C39">Kull <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C88">van Wilgen and Richardson 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C94">Wilson <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>). This is true for invasive species in the genus <italic>Prosopis</italic>.Taxa of <italic>Prosopis</italic> (mesquite; Fabaceae) occur in most of the world's hot arid and semi-arid regions as native or introduced species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C62">Pasiecznik <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>). The genus <italic>Prosopis</italic> as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C11">Burkart (1976)</xref> consists of 44 species. They have been introduced globally and have become naturalized or invasive in many places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C71">Rejmánek and Richardson 2013</xref>). Several <italic>Prosopis</italic> species are also ‘weedy’ in parts of their native ranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C62">Pasiecznik <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>). In this paper we define native species as those whose presence in an area is not attributable to introduction by humans (this includes species that have spread into areas without assistance from humans by overcoming biogeographic barriers). Alien taxa are those whose presence in an area is attributable to introduction by humans. Naturalized taxa are alien taxa that are self-sustaining. Invasive taxa are naturalized taxa that have spread substantially from introduction sites (further details in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C67">Pyšek <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>). We define ‘weedy’ taxa as native taxa that have increased in abundance and/or geographic range in their native ranges.Numerous <italic>Prosopis</italic> taxa are recognized as major invaders across large parts of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C62">Pasiecznik <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C10">Brown <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>). ‘<italic>Prosopis</italic>’ is listed as one of the 20 weeds of national significance in Australia and taxa in the genus are declared as major invasive species in Ethiopia, India, Kenya and South Africa, and Sudan is advocating for its eradication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C30">FAO 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C3">Australian Weeds Committee 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C42">Low 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C90">van Wilgen <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). Factors that make many <italic>Prosopis</italic> species successful invaders include the production of large numbers of seeds that remain viable for decades, rapid growth rates, an ability to coppice after damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C31">Felker 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C79">Shiferaw <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>), root systems that allow them to efficiently utilize both surface and ground water (to depths of &gt;50 m) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C52">Nilsen <italic>et al</italic>. 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C26">Dzikiti <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>), and allelopathic and allelochemical effects on other plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C27">Elfadl and Luukkanen 2006</xref>). Many <italic>Prosopis</italic> species can also withstand climatic extremes such as very high temperatures and low rainfall, and they are not limited by alkaline, saline or unfertile soils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C62">Pasiecznik <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C79">Shiferaw <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>). Interspecific hybridization also enhances invasiveness in many introduced regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C98">Zimmermann 1991</xref>).<italic>Prosopis</italic> invasions generate environmental, social and economic benefits as well as harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C13">Chikuni <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C33">Geesing <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C95">Wise <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). This has led to contentious issues surrounding the genus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C73">Richardson 1998<italic>b</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C88">van Wilgen and Richardson 2014</xref>). Some advocates promote it as a ‘wonder plant’ while others call for its eradication, or contrast its positive and negative aspects, e.g. ‘Boon or bane’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C82">Tiwari 1999</xref>), ‘Pest or providence, weed or wonder tree?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C58">Pasiecznik 1999</xref>), ‘Invasive weed or valuable forest resource?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C59">Pasiecznik 2002</xref>). Contrasting views, contradictory perceptions and unclear policies are limiting options for constructive dialogue between different parties. This is exacerbated by problems in identifying and differentiating morphologically similar species, and by a general lack of knowledge on the distribution, scale of invasion, benefits, impacts and effective management approaches. Furthermore, many different approaches for managing <italic>Prosopis</italic> have been tried in different situations, without a thorough evaluation of the relative effectiveness of the methods. The Food and Agricultural Organization has called for a sound, unbiased global overview of <italic>Prosopis</italic> to act as a prerequisite for the holistic management of the genus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C30">FAO 2006</xref>). Such reviews have been useful for guiding and prioritizing management and improving knowledge in other groups of woody invasive plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C74">Richardson and Rejmánek 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C75">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C39">Kull <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C93">Wilson <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>).The aims of this paper are thus to (i) contrast benefits and costs of invasive <italic>Prosopis</italic>, (ii) update knowledge on <italic>Prosopis</italic> occurrence and introductions globally and highlight the potential range expansion of <italic>Prosopis</italic>, (iii) elucidate ecological, economic and social factors that shape attempts at managing <italic>Prosopis</italic>, (iv) compare and contrast the effectiveness of different management approaches in different regions, and (v) identify priorities for research and policy development.

Photos: S. Choge (J), G. Cruz (I), P. Manudu (E, F), R. Shackleton (A–D, G, K–N).Several species are also weedy and thus provide both benefits and costs in their native ranges (<italic>P. affinis</italic>, <italic>P. caldenia</italic>, <italic>P. campestris</italic>, <italic>P. chilensis</italic>, <italic>P. cineraria</italic>, <italic>P. farcta</italic>, <italic>P. glandulosa</italic>, <italic>P. hassleri</italic>, <italic>P. humilis</italic>, <italic>P. juliflora</italic>, <italic>P. kuntzei</italic>, <italic>P. nigra</italic>, <italic>P. pubescens</italic>, <italic>P. ruscifolia</italic>, <italic>P. strombulifera</italic>, <italic>P. tamarugo</italic>, <italic>P. velutina</italic>) <bold>[see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/plu027/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supporting Information</ext-link>]</bold>. At least 19 (invasive and weedy) of the 44 species in the genus are known to generate benefits and costs, with the rest being only beneficial. The invasiveness and potential negative impacts of many <italic>Prosopis</italic> species are still unknown as only a handful have been introduced.<italic>Prosopis</italic> species have been used for a variety of products for more than 5000 years in their native ranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C62">Pasiecznik <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>). The numerous goods and services provided by <italic>Prosopis</italic> have led to global introductions and have made some species important for local communities. <italic>Prosopis</italic> is commonly used for fuel, fodder, windbreaks, shade, construction materials and soil stabilization through its invasive ranges in Africa and Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C62">Pasiecznik <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C95">Wise <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). In some areas the benefits from <italic>Prosopis</italic> are, or were, regarded as a key income source for many households. In one village in Malawi, 44 % of people relied on <italic>Prosopis</italic> products as a primary or supplementary source of income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C13">Chikuni <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>). Communities in Kenya have benefited greatly from the sale of charcoal and <italic>Prosopis</italic> pods for fodder, boosting the local economy in some areas by US$1.5 million per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C17">Choge <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). In India, <italic>Prosopis</italic> provides up to 70 % of fuelwood needs for local households in some dry region villages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C62">Pasiecznik <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>).Although utilization is most common in rural settings to sustain local livelihoods, <italic>Prosopis</italic> products are also exploited on a large scale by private companies. In South Africa, pods are collected to produce organic medicines (‘manna’) that are said to have properties that stabilize blood sugar levels in humans. This company is making profits of US$100 000 per annum and has the potential to increase profits 10-fold if the product is marketed internationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C95">Wise <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). A company in Brazil, Riocon, has an annual turnover of US$6 million a year from the sale of <italic>Prosopis</italic> pod flour for animal feeds (A. Davi, Ricocon, pers. comm.).Cause-and-effect network diagram showing the negative effects of <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasions and management options that can be used to target each stage of invasion.Local communities in Kenya, Sudan, Eritrea, Malawi and Pakistan noted a range of negative consequences arising from invasive <italic>Prosopis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C15">Choge <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C13">Chikuni <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C48">Mwangi and Swallow 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C40">Laxén 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C8">Bokrezion 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C38">Kazmi <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>)<italic>.</italic> These included effects on livestock health, <italic>Prosopis</italic> thorns causing tyre punctures and flesh wounds, dense thickets reducing access to water points, roads, infrastructure and agricultural and range lands, drying up of water sources, reducing natural forest cover and the services from these forests, as well as providing refuge for thieves.In many parts of Africa <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasions are a leading cause of detrimental impacts on local community structure and functioning, leading to an increase in their vulnerability. This includes the potential loss of land rights for local livestock herders in Mali and violent conflict over limited natural resources between neighbouring communities in Ethiopia and Kenya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C12">Centre for Sustainable Development Initiatives 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C24">Djoudi <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C80">Stark <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). One Kenyan community has even taken the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and the Kenyan government to court over the harm created by the introduction of <italic>Prosopis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C63">Pasiecznik <italic>et al</italic>. 2006<italic>a</italic></xref>).Native weedy <italic>Prosopis</italic> taxa are also estimated to cause a loss of US$200–500 million per annum to the livestock industry in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C21">DeLoach 1984</xref>). In South Africa costs of managing <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasions are substantial, averaging $35.5 million per annum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C90">van Wilgen <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>).Perceptions on the benefits and costs of invasive alien species are strongly influenced by invasion abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C7">Binggeli 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C78">Shackleton <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). As abundance increases, associated costs rise and benefits fall due to issues such as resource accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C95">Wise <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). In India, <italic>Prosopis</italic> was initially seen as beneficial, but over time the negative consequences became more apparent, leading to increasingly negative perceptions of the plant from some quarters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C62">Pasiecznik <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>). A similar situation arose in Kenya where, as <italic>Prosopis</italic> became invasive, it was described as a ‘bad omen’ by some local people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C14">Choge and Chikamai 2004</xref>) and more than 65 % of people in three villages mentioned that their lives would have been better off if <italic>Prosopis</italic> was never introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C45">Maundu <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>). In Sudan, over 90 % of livestock farmers viewed <italic>Prosopis</italic> as a problem as it became more widespread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C29">Elsidig <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>).In many areas, invasive <italic>Prosopis</italic> trees do not sustain their full use potential due to intraspecific competition in dense stands which, generally, form over time. In such cases relatively few pods are produced for fodder and human consumption and dense invasive stands become impenetrable for humans and livestock making utilization of resources difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C13">Chikuni <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C48">Mwangi and Swallow 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C95">Wise <italic>et al</italic>. (2012)</xref> show that net economic benefits decrease as invasion densities increase in South Africa. They predict that the net cost of having <italic>Prosopis</italic> in the country will become negative in 4–20 years depending on future rates of spread. A framework by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C78">Shackleton <italic>et al</italic>.

This raises questions about the introduction of ‘miracle’ species in the past such as <italic>Acacia</italic>, <italic>Leucaena</italic> and <italic>Prosopis</italic> because the adverse impacts tend to exceed the benefits as the invasions progress, if left unmanaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C23">de Wit <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C60">Pasiecznik 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C95">Wise <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C42">Low 2012</xref>), as well as the continued promotion of invasive alien species like <italic>Prosopis</italic> for biofuels today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C96">Witt 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C49">Naseeruddin <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>).The fact that the detrimental effects emerge only after invasions have reached unmanageable levels exacerbates contentious issues surrounding invasive species and may delay management decisions, in many cases restricting the implementation of effective management. There have also been conflicts of interest regarding which form of management to implement—how best to preserve, exploit and even enhance benefits while reducing negative impacts of <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C98">Zimmermann 1991</xref>).Time scale of all <italic>Prosopis</italic> introductions globally (<italic>n</italic> = 82 known species–country introduction dates).Seed introductions have come both from native populations and from naturalized and invasive populations in countries where <italic>Prosopis</italic> was introduced previously. However, the original sources of seed and dates for introductions to many countries are poorly documented. Seed introduced to Hawaii came from a tree in France with a speculated provenance in Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C62">Pasiecznik <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>) and <italic>P. pallida</italic> introduced to Australia came from Hawaii (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C62">Pasiecznik <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>). South Africa had multiple introductions of many species and seed was most likely introduced from native ranges in Chile, Honduras, Mexico and USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C98">Zimmermann 1991</xref>). Seed from naturalized populations in South Africa was introduced into Egypt and seed introduced into Sudan came from South Africa and Egypt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C62">Pasiecznik <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>). The provenance of early <italic>Prosopis</italic> introductions to India is uncertain (likely Mexico or Jamaica); later introductions came from Argentina, Australia, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C62">Pasiecznik <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>).Most introductions of <italic>Prosopis</italic> were intentional, although there have been accidental cross-border introductions between neighbouring counties. <italic>Prosopis</italic> was introduced for many reasons: to provide fodder and shade in the arid areas of South Africa and Australia; for dune stabilization, afforestation and fuel wood supply in Sudan; for live fencing in Malawi; initially to rehabilitate old quarries and later for afforestation and the provision of fuelwood and fodder in Kenya; for fuelwood production and rehabilitating degraded soil in India; for local greening, ornamental cultivation and soil stabilization in many Middle Eastern countries; and for vegetation trials in Spain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C98">Zimmermann 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C34">Ghazanfar 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C62">Pasiecznik <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C15">Choge <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C13">Chikuni <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C27">Elfadl and Luukkanen 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C87">van Klinken <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C40">Laxén 2007</xref>; N.

It is unlikely that <italic>Prosopis</italic> has been introduced into more places in the 13 years since that review was undertaken, but rather that data availability has increased in the intervening period or that there has been unintentional spread e.g. into Tanzania. Of the 129 countries, 26 have only native species, 64 have only introduced <italic>Prosopis</italic> species, and 39 have both native and introduced species. <italic>Prosopis</italic> is weedy in 38 % of countries where it occurs naturally and 38 % of species in the genus are currently categorized as weedy in their native ranges. The distribution and scale of invasions in countries with invasive <italic>Prosopis</italic> are not well known, with only 13 % of countries having detailed distribution or percentage cover data and not just records of occurrence.Climate matching was used to assess areas of potential naturalization and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C65">Peel <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). We identified many regions that are climatically suitable for <italic>Prosopis</italic> where there are currently no records of any taxa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU027F5">5</xref>D).This includes countries in Europe (Greece, Italy, Portugal, Romania, etc.), South America (Guyana and Suriname), Asia (China, Japan, Nepal, South Korea, etc.) and numerous island/atoll countries and overseas territories (Comoros, Malta, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, etc.) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU027F5">5</xref>D; <bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/plu027/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supporting Information</ext-link></bold>). All countries where at least one <italic>Prosopis</italic> species has been introduced and has established have the potential for the naturalization of additional <italic>Prosopis</italic> species. For example, there are currently seven naturalized and invasive <italic>Prosopis</italic> species recorded in South Africa, but the country is climatically suitable for many more species <bold>[see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/plu027/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supporting Information</ext-link>]</bold>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C45">Maundu <italic>et al</italic>.

Currently 23 countries with weedy or invasive <italic>Prosopis</italic> (21 %) implement some form of formal management. No countries rely exclusively on biological control, 6 (26 %) use only mechanical or chemical control, 5 (22 %) use control through utilization and 11 (48 %) apply an integrated approach (three or more methods, including biological control, mechanical control, chemical control, control through utilization and cultural control) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLU027TB2">2</xref>).Countries that use only chemical and mechanical control are mainly found in the Middle East and have small isolated invasions and are usually wealthier nations, whereas control through utilization is applied in poorer countries such as Kenya and Ethiopia. Biological control is driven by Australia and South Africa; however, there are also areas where ‘biological control agents’ are present but were not deliberately introduced, for example, Egypt (seed-feeding beetles—Coleoptera and Burchidae), Sudan and Yemen (<italic>Algarobis prosopis</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C22">Delobel and Fediere 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C1">Al-Shurai and Labrada 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C4">Babiker 2006</xref>).

There are concerns, however, that introduced insects could affect less invasive <italic>P. pallida</italic> populations in these areas that are utilized by local communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C63">Pasiecznik <italic>et al</italic>. 2006<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C64"><italic>b</italic></xref>). Another view is that any effect of such insects could improve the usefulness of less invasive taxa by reducing seed production and therefore potential invasiveness and could lead to less dense stands with larger trees and greater pod production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C97">Zachariades <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>).Logistic regression highlighting the importance of different ecological, economical and social factors in determining management of <italic>Prosopis</italic> within a country.Simple socioeconomic variables are poor predictors of the existence of management strategies as there is evidence of management in countries at all levels of development (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLU027TB1">1</xref>). Many of the poorer countries receive foreign aid to implement and run management programmes, at least at the outset.The findings of this review contradict previous publications that have argued that less developed countries have conducted less research and management of invasive alien species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C47">McNeely <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C68">Pyšek <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C54">Nuñez and Pauchard 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C46">McGeoch <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>). Some developing countries are at the forefront of <italic>Prosopis</italic> research and management such as Kenya (control through utilization, social impacts) and South Africa (biological control), along with developed countries such as Australia and the USA. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C96">Witt (2010)</xref> noted that the prominence and severity of the impacts of <italic>Prosopis</italic> in developing countries has motivated this investment in research and understanding. However, there may be a lack of research for less prominent invasive alien species in poorer regions of the world.A classification and regression tree model using social, ecological and economic variables to explore the drivers of different types of <italic>Prosopis</italic> management globally.A comparison of techniques for managing <italic>Prosopis</italic> and their advantages and disadvantages.The benefits and impacts and choice of different management approaches of <italic>Prosopis</italic> have led to contentious issues regarding management. Control through utilization is advocated by some as a management technique that enables benefit of invasive <italic>Prosopis</italic> to be utilized while simultaneously reducing the negative impacts of invasions and promoting local development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C14">Choge and Chikamai 2004</xref>). However, many believe that this approach is inefficient at reducing invasions and leads to other problems such as dependencies (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLU027TB2">2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C89">van Wilgen <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>) and that other approaches such as chemical and mechanical clearing should be prioritized, although they are costly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C96">Witt 2010</xref>). To date, there is no evidence of the success of control through utilization as a management technique (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLU027TB2">2</xref>). The control through utilization approach is motivated around local development (which is needed) more so than managing invasions at large spatial and temporal scales.There are conflicting views on best management approaches (eradication vs. control through utilization) in different villages in Kenya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C48">Mwangi and Swallow 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C53">Njoroge <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). Similar cases of contentious issues and conflicts of interest have been seen for other management approaches such as biological control. In South Africa only seed-feeding beetles were introduced so that neither the <italic>Prosopis</italic> trees themselves nor the production of pods would be harmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C72">Richardson 1998<italic>a</italic></xref>)—even though better biological control agents have been identified that would harm trees and be more effective in reducing invasions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C97">Zachariades <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>).Despite the growing body of research on management options for weedy and invasive <italic>Prosopis</italic> stands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C87">van Klinken <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>), there is an ongoing debate on how to effectively manage large-scale invasions. Different approaches are currently being used to manage <italic>Prosopis</italic>, each with their own set of advantages and disadvantages (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLU027TB2">2</xref>). The following case studies were selected as being representative of different management strategies and also encompass the approaches most commonly employed in countries with different levels of socioeconomic development (developed—Australia; emerging economies—South Africa; developing—Kenya). The case studies are also characteristic of management strategies driven and implemented by different stakeholders, e.g. government driven with mainly private implementation (Australia), mainly government driven and implemented (South Africa) and government driven with some non-government organization (NGO) and international support (Kenya).<italic>Prosopis</italic> has invaded over one million hectares and could potentially spread over 70 % of Australia's land area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C55">Osmond 2003</xref>). <italic>Prosopis</italic> taxa are considered as one of the 20 worst invasives in Australia, and in accordance with the <italic>Weeds Management Act</italic> 2001, a strategic plan has been developed to guide management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C3">Australian Weeds Committee 2012</xref>). <italic>Prosopis</italic> is a declared weed in all the mainland states and one territory in Australia and has been categorized in accordance with the threats it poses and the corresponding management responses that need to be implemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C85">van Klinken and Campbell 2009</xref>). This includes preventing introductions, trade, sale or movements of <italic>Prosopis</italic> taxa and the eradication of small populations and control of large populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C3">Australian Weeds Committee 2012</xref>). In general, most landowners use mechanical and chemical control measures to manage <italic>Prosopis</italic>. Although control and eradication programmes are primarily funded by the state, many private landowners also fund management operations. For example, in Queensland $A4 million was allocated for <italic>Prosopis</italic> management by the government, which was supplemented further by over $A600 000 by landholders between 1995 and 1999 and over $A2 million was spent on clearing between 2001 and 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C44">Martin and van Klinken 2006</xref>).Control of <italic>Prosopis</italic> first started in 1954 at Mardie Station, Western Australia, and by 1962 a major reduction in <italic>Prosopis</italic> density had been achieved. Populations increased again when funding diminished, but in the mid-1970s the allocation of government funding led to substantial progress with clearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C85">van Klinken and Campbell 2009</xref>). In other areas of Western Australia control was improving, but after funding lapsed many infestations returned in the 1990s with the exception of some areas such as Yeeda Station where control had been successful due to annual monitoring and clearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C85">van Klinken and Campbell 2009</xref>). In Queensland substantial funding was invested for clearing in the area around Comongin Station, and by 2005 over 4000 ha of dense <italic>Prosopis</italic> stands had been removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C85">van Klinken and Campbell 2009</xref>). In northern Queensland research concluded that eradication was feasible in the region and significant steps have been made towards this goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C85">van Klinken and Campbell 2009</xref>). New South Wales and South Australia have similar examples of good control efforts and others that have had limited success due to a lapse in control and monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C85">van Klinken and Campbell 2009</xref>).Four biological control agents have been released in Australia: <italic>Algarobius bottimeri</italic> and <italic>A. prosopis</italic> (seed-feeding bruchids), <italic>Evippe</italic> species (a leaf-tying moth) and <italic>Prosopidopsylla flava</italic> (a sap sucker) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C86">van Klinken <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C84">van Klinken 2012</xref>). Two have established widely (<italic>A. prosopis</italic>, <italic>Evippe</italic> species), and the latter has had noticeable impacts on <italic>Prosopis</italic> populations through reducing long-term growth rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C84">van Klinken 2012</xref>). Biological control in Australia has been more successful than in other places like South Africa and the benefit-to-cost ratios are positive (0.5), with expectations to increase in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C56">Page and Lacey 2006</xref>). The release of more agents is recommended to further improve control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C86">van Klinken <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C84">van Klinken 2012</xref>).Experiments have shown that some species are highly fire tolerant (especially the hybrids), which reduces the potential for using fire as a control method in many areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C87">van Klinken <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>). Grazing control has also been advised to help prevent establishment and further spread of <italic>Prosopis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C19">Csurhes 1996</xref>), although this approach has had limited success in Argentina and the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C25">Dussart <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C9">Brown and Archer 1989</xref>). There are also regulations on the transport of livestock in areas infested with <italic>Prosopis</italic> to prevent its spread and accidental introduction elsewhere in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C3">Australian Weeds Committee 2012</xref>). Management policy is backed up by good legislation; Australia is one of two countries with a national management strategy. The government has also published many easily accessible documents on <italic>Prosopis</italic> management methods to inform landowners on control measures, and the <italic>Prosopis</italic> strategic plan places a lot of emphasis on educating and making stakeholders aware of <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasions and how to manage them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C3">Australian Weeds Committee 2012</xref>). There have been rewarding examples of control success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C85">van Klinken and Campbell 2009</xref>); however, <italic>Prosopis</italic> populations continue to spread in many areas and further management is needed.<italic>Prosopis</italic> invasions in South Africa cover an estimated 1.8 million hectares, and are increasing at 8 % per annum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C91">Versfeld <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C83">Van den Berg 2010</xref>). They have the potential to invade between 5 and 32 million hectares of South Africa based on climatic suitability—about a third of the area of the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C77">Rouget <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>). <italic>Prosopis</italic> is declared as a category 2 invasive alien species because it provides benefits and causes harm; this status means that it is legal to grow <italic>Prosopis</italic> in demarcated areas once a permit has been issued. A combination of mechanical, chemical and biological control methods is used to control <italic>Prosopis</italic>, mainly by the government-managed Working for Water programme. Three seed-feeding beetles (<italic>A. prosopis</italic>, <italic>A. bottimeri</italic> and <italic>Neltumius arizonensis</italic>) were introduced as biological control agents to try and reduce spread while maintaining its benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C98">Zimmermann 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C18">Coetzer and Hoffmann 1997</xref>). <italic>Neltumius arizonensis</italic> failed to establish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C97">Zachariades <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). Although biological control is considered the most cost-effective way of managing large-scale invasions of many species, there are many cases where the agents fail to make a significant impact and <italic>Prosopis</italic> is one of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C90">van Wilgen <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). The overall return on investment is low compared with biological control programmes for <italic>Opuntia</italic> species and Australian <italic>Acacia</italic> species in South Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C90">van Wilgen <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). There is potential to release more agents, such as the <italic>Evippe</italic> species which is already successful in Australia (see above), should the contentious issues surrounding the benefits and costs of <italic>Prosopis</italic> be resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C97">Zachariades <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). <italic>Prosopis</italic> cover increased by ∼35 % between 1996 and 2008, despite the expenditure of R435.5 million (US$42.7 million) on control over this period. Only 15 100 ha were cleared using mechanical and chemical control with this substantial budget (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C90">van Wilgen <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>), which makes the cost/ha very expensive (US$2828). The limited success to date may be due to lack of a management strategy and of prioritization of management projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C32">Forsyth <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). There is a need for researchers, managers and policy-makers to agree on new strategies for prioritizing areas for interventions to curb the spread of <italic>Prosopis</italic> and to ensure that the limited resources are used effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C32">Forsyth <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). There have been some attempts at controlling <italic>Prosopis</italic> through utilization, but they had no noticeable impacts on invasions, and these initiatives failed as input and transport costs were too high and financial returns were low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C99">Zimmermann <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>). South Africa also has many particularly aggressive hybrids that form dense shrub-dominated stands, which makes the utilization approach difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C99">Zimmermann <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>).<italic>Prosopis</italic> is estimated to have invaded one million hectares and has the potential to invade nearly half of Kenya's surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C45">Maundu <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C96">Witt 2010</xref>). It was declared a noxious weed in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C42">Low 2012</xref>). Biological and mechanical control was initially proposed as the management approach to combat <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasions, but the government later opted for a control-by-utilization approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C30">FAO 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C61">Pasiecznik and Felker 2006</xref>). The FAO, with support from several NGOs, initiated programmes to manage <italic>Prosopis</italic> through utilization. These efforts were continued by the government's forestry department and forestry research organization (KEFRI) following the end of these projects. Considerable time and effort was taken to build capacity, formulate good policies and educate communities to utilize the goods and services from <italic>Prosopis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C63">Pasiecznik <italic>et al</italic>. 2006<italic>a</italic></xref>). For example, small-scale utilization projects were established and a cookbook using <italic>Prosopis</italic> flour was created and supplied to communities to promote its use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C16">Choge <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C63">Pasiecznik <italic>et al</italic>. 2006<italic>a</italic></xref>). Although initial costs for training and purchasing appropriate small-scale processing machinery are high, they are considered to be lower than other control approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C63">Pasiecznik <italic>et al</italic>. 2006<italic>a</italic></xref>). In 2002, trade in <italic>Prosopis</italic> goods and services was worth US$2122 per household per year in some villages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C15">Choge <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>). Ten years later, trade in <italic>Prosopis</italic> products in four selected areas was estimated to exceed US$1.5 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C17">Choge <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). Each tonne of pods that are collected and milled into flour is estimated to remove approximately two million viable seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C63">Pasiecznik <italic>et al</italic>. 2006<italic>a</italic></xref>). Changes in legislation, and the promotion of <italic>Prosopis</italic> use, helped drive the substantial rise in use and led to 100 % of the locals in one village supporting control through utilization as the most preferred management method to adopt in Kenya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C53">Njoroge <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). However, in other villages 85–90 % of people surveyed considered complete eradication of <italic>Prosopis</italic> to be the best option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C48">Mwangi and Swallow 2005</xref>). There are still, however, contentious issues surrounding the benefits and costs of the species and management approaches in Kenya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C63">Pasiecznik <italic>et al</italic>. 2006<italic>a</italic></xref>). There are many publications on the profits that are being made through utilization, but there is no evidence that these utilization programmes have contained or reduced the extent of <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasions. There is, therefore, a need for further investigation of the successes and failure of control through utilization programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C33">Geesing <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>). A common problem with trying to promote <italic>Prosopis</italic> utilization is that it is seen as an inferior resource in many communities, with people preferring to use native species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C33">Geesing <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>). Recently, a new utilization approach to increase invasive <italic>Prosopis</italic> use has been adopted in Kenya—a power station (based on technology from India) is currently being built in the Kenyan Rift Valley which aims to produce electricity for the local area from burning <italic>Prosopis</italic> biomass (S. Choge, pers. comm.).Requirements for research and management needs regarding <italic>Prosopis</italic> and factors limiting success.National strategies and management/action plans need to be created and adopted to guide the coordinated control of <italic>Prosopis</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU027F7">7</xref>)<italic>.</italic> Such national strategies and plans are important to set up frameworks on how to guide <italic>Prosopis</italic> management and research<italic>.</italic> Numerous organizations and national governments globally have undertaken projects to control <italic>Prosopis</italic>, and planning and prioritization from the outset would ensure greater success. Country-specific strategic plans need to be created as there are large differences in invasion rates and scales and socio-economic situations within different areas of the world.Introductions of known invasive <italic>Prosopis</italic> species to climatically suitable countries where it does not already exist should be undertaken such as in China, European countries along the Mediterranean and North East Asia, and spread of <italic>Prosopis</italic> into new areas within countries where it is invasive should be prevented. Risk assessments for purposeful introductions need to be conducted in the future. Pathways of accidental introductions between neighbouring countries and into new areas in countries with invasive <italic>Prosopis</italic> need to be managed. This could include regulations on livestock and fodder transport which is currently implemented in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C3">Australian Weeds Committee 2012</xref>). This is done by holding livestock in feed lots for a week before they are transported to ensure that all <italic>Prosopis</italic> seeds have excreted.Countries need to eradicate small naturalized populations before they become invasive. Early detection and rapid response is a cost-effective way of preventing invasive species from getting out of hand and causing devastating, irreversible impacts in the future. For example, in Spain, <italic>Prosopis</italic> has started to show signs of naturalization at a single location where it was planted for experiments and eradication attempts now would be most cost effective in the long run (N. Pasiecznik and E. Peñalvo López, unpubl. res.).There is also an urgent need for managers and researchers to monitor the effectiveness of control measures. Adaptive management needs to be promoted and applied for controlling <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasions where operational success is so far limited, so that the causes of the failures can be identified and addressed to improve overall control. Managers and researchers need to collaborate in research to design from the outset successful adaptive management strategies to be implemented.There are many research questions regarding <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasions in many parts of the world that need to be answered to improve management (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU027F7">7</xref>).These include correctly identifying <italic>Prosopis</italic> species present and gaining consensus on the status introduced and weedy species (e.g. following the criteria proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C69">Pyšek <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). There have been numerous misidentifications of introduced <italic>Prosopis</italic> species, especially in Africa. This has caused much taxonomic confusion and contradictions between different sources of information that are only starting to be clarified. There are also hybridized populations in many areas where <italic>Prosopis</italic> has been introduced, further hindering identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C98">Zimmermann 1991</xref>. It was recently recognized that <italic>P. pallida</italic>, which was seen as not being as invasive as other species, is more widespread than originally thought as it was misidentified as <italic>P. juliflora</italic> in Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C64">Pasiecznik <italic>et al</italic>. 2006<italic>b</italic></xref>). Most species introduced to Africa were described as <italic>P. chilensis</italic>, but this is not the case, and accurate species lists are not available for many African countries such as Angola. Molecular methods are useful for clarifying taxonomic issues, especially in areas where hybridization has taken place. It is important to know which taxa are present for management, e.g. when looking for biological control agents and understanding ecology and rates of spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C69">Pyšek <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>).There is a need to improve the understanding of <italic>Prosopis</italic> distribution and population sizes in introduced ranges to guide management planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C94">Wilson <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>). As indicated earlier, only 13 % of countries with naturalized and invasive <italic>Prosopis</italic> have maps or detailed records of occurrence and scale of invasion. No information is available on the scale of <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasions on any of the Pacific (besides Hawaii), Indian Ocean or Caribbean Islands. Only a few African countries have a good understanding of the scale of invasions and, in Asia, information on the distribution of invasive <italic>Prosopis</italic> is only available for India and Pakistan. Such knowledge is essential for planning and implementing management. Bioclimatic mapping at board local scales is useful for understanding potential spread and occurrence of invasive species. However, bioclimatic models can be of limited value at very local scales as other biotic and abiotic factors come into play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C76">Robinson <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). On a global scale, bioclimatic modelling is useful for highlighting which countries and species need risk assessments for purposeful introductions, and where introduction pathways need to be monitored to prevent unintentional introductions, e.g. between India and China or Iran and Turkmenistan.Further knowledge on the ecology, local perceptions, and the ecological, economic and social benefits and impacts of <italic>Prosopis</italic> is needed to guide management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C94">Wilson <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>). Our study has highlighted that knowledge on <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasions is essential for management (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLU027TB1">1</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU027F6">6</xref>). Most of the literature comes from a handful of countries (Australia, India, Kenya, South Africa, USA), and research in other areas is needed since each region has its own set of factors that drive invasions and complicate management. There is also a need for research to better predict trends such as future densities, extent and impacts which is particularly important when it comes down to developing strategic responses. Drivers of weediness in areas where it is native such as Argentina, Mexico, Middle East and the USA require further study to improve understanding of what drives native plants to become invasive and provide insight into how to manage them.The issue of the lack of knowledge is also present for research on the effectiveness of controlling populations using different methods. Utilization as a control method is becoming popular in many areas such as Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya. However, despite many reports showing how much monetary benefit <italic>Prosopis</italic> has provided, there is no information on how successful this approach is for controlling <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasions. There are also conflicting ideas on the role and success of biological control in Australia and South Africa and further work is needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C97">Zachariades <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). There is scope for identifying and potentially releasing additional biological control agents to improve control success in areas where this has been limited until now, such as in South Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C97">Zachariades <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). Research is needed to identify novel solutions to aid the dilemma of management and contentious issues regarding invasive <italic>Prosopis</italic> globally. These include methods that retain the benefits, but reduce the impacts substantially.Risk assessments need to be run for <italic>Prosopis</italic> species that have not been introduced yet to determine whether they might be better candidates for introduction, by providing benefits with fewer costs associated with invasiveness.Organizations involved in addressing land degradation and invasions should promote the dissemination of knowledge and awareness of both the impacts and benefits of <italic>Prosopis</italic> to prevent unwise introductions and promote management (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU027F7">7</xref>). Some people still advocate the introduction of <italic>Prosopis</italic> species long after the severe impacts caused by invasions of these species were widely publicized; this has been described as ‘dangerous aid’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU027C42">Low 2012</xref>). Having regular multidisciplinary international meetings or workshops on <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasions may help to spread knowledge and create dialogue between parties, which could help to reduce contentious issues surrounding many invasive <italic>Prosopis</italic> species. The creation of management strategies using transdisciplinary approaches would also help to provide solutions acceptable to all stakeholders in situations where conflicting goals exist.<italic>Prosopis</italic> species are among the most widespread and damaging invasive woody plants in semi-arid and arid regions of the world and there is much potential for taxa to spread further. The detrimental effects on the environment and human livelihoods are escalating rapidly and there is an urgent need to devise more effective management approaches to drastically reduce adverse impacts and enhance benefits. However, there are still critical gaps in our knowledge of its ecology, impacts and how to retain benefits and reduce costs, and a lack of management capacity in many countries. Clearly focused research and strategic planning is needed to improve management, reduce costs and improve benefit flows.The DST-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology and Working for Water Programme through their collaborative research project on ‘Integrated management of invasive alien species in South Africa’ – <grant-sponsor id="cs1" rid="cn1" xlink:type="simple">National Research Foundation</grant-sponsor> (grant <grant-num id="cn1" rid="cs1" xlink:type="simple">85417</grant-num>).R.T.S. and D.M.R. conceived the idea.
