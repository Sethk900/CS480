VARIATION IN LITTER SIZE: A TEST OF HYPOTHESES IN RICHARDSON'S GROUND SQUIRRELS.We studied litter size variation in a population of Richardson's ground squirrels (<em>Spermophilus richardsonii</em>) in Alberta, Canada, from 1987 to 2004. Litter size at first emergence of juveniles from the natal burrow ranged from 1 to 14; the most common litter sizes, collectively accounting for 41.0% of 999 litters, were 6 and 7. The number of offspring surviving to adulthood (attained on emergence from hibernation as yearlings) increased with increasing litter size, a result that was not predicted by Lack's â€œoptimal litter sizeâ€ hypothesis, Mountford's â€œcliff-edgeâ€ effect, or the â€œbad-yearsâ€ effect. Contrary to the negative effects predicted by the â€œcost of reproductionâ€ hypothesis, litter size had no significant influence on survival of mothers to the subsequent year or on the size of the subsequent litter. Rather, our results best fit the predictions of the â€œindividual optimizationâ€ hypothesis, which suggests that litter size is determined by the body condition and environmental circumstances of each mother. Supporting this hypothesis, survival of individual offspring was not significantly associated with litter size. Additionally, year-to-year changes in maternal body mass at mating were positively associated with concurrent changes in litter size (<em>r</em> = 0.56), suggesting that litter size depends on the body condition of the mother. Because the mean number of recruits to adulthood increased as litter size increased (<em>r</em><sup>2</sup> = 0.96) and litter size increased with maternal condition, offspring productivity was greater for mothers in better body condition.
