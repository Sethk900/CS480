Effects of elevated atmospheric CO2, cutting frequency, and differential day/night atmospheric warming on root growth and turnover of Phalaris swards.We investigated seasonal root production and root turnover of fertilized and well-watered monocultures of <em>Phalaris</em> for 2 years using minirhizotrons installed in six newly designed temperature gradient tunnels, combined with sequential soil coring. Elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> treatments were combined with two cutting frequencies and three warming scenarios: no warming, +3.0/+3.0 and +2.2/+4.0Â°C (day/night) atmospheric warming. The elevated CO<sub>2</sub> treatment increased both new and net root length production primarily when combined with atmospheric warming, where the constant warming treatment had a greater positive effect than the increased night-time warming treatment. Responses to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> were greater when the swards were cut more frequently and responsiveness varied with season. For <em>Phalaris</em> swards, 17% of total net primary productivity went belowground. On account of root turnover, only one-third of the new roots produced in the year following establishment could be expected, on average, to be recovered from soil cores. The interaction between the effects of CO<sub>2</sub> and warming, combined with the differential effects of the two warming treatments, has important implications for modelling belowground responses to projected climate change.
