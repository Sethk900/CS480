Body Temperature and Thermoregulatory Behaviour of the Lizard Ameiva ameiva in Central Amazonian ForestsBody temperatures and thermoregulatory behaviour of the teiid lizard Ameiva ameiva inhabiting the edge and the understory were studied in Central Amazonian forests. Despite of differences in the thermal profile of the habitats, the mean body temperature was the same for active lizards observed at the edge or inside the forest, where only slight peculiarities in thermoregulatory behaviour were observed. A. ameiva is capable of maintaining body temperature significantly above microhabitat temperature.
