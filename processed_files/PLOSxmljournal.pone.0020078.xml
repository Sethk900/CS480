To explain the N-induced species loss, three functionally based hypotheses have been proposed: the aboveground competition hypothesis, the belowground competition hypothesis, and the total competition hypothesis. However, none of them is supported sufficiently by field experiments. A main challenge to testing these hypotheses is to ascertain the role of shoot and root competition in controlling plant responses to N enrichment. Simultaneously examining both aboveground and belowground responses in natural ecosystems is logistically complex, and has rarely been done.  In a two-year N addition experiment conducted in a natural grassland ecosystem, we investigated both above- and belowground responses of plants at the individual, species, and community levels. Plants differed significantly in their responses to N addition across the different organizational levels. The community-level species loss was mainly due to the loss of perennial grasses and forbs, while the relative abundance of plant species was dependent mainly on individual-level responses. Plasticity in biomass allocation was much smaller within a species than between species, providing a biological basis for explaining the functionally based species loss. All species increased biomass allocation to aboveground parts, but species with high belowground allocations were replaced by those with high aboveground allocations, indicating that the increased aboveground competition was the key process responsible for the observed diversity loss after N addition in this grassland ecosystem.  Our findings shed new light on the validity of the three competing hypotheses concerning species loss in response to N enrichment. They also have important implications for predicting the future impacts of N deposition on the structure and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. In addition, we have developed a new technique for ascertaining the roles of aboveground and belowground competition in determining plant responses to N fertilization.  The experiment was established in 1999, which included 7 treatments in total, each with 9 replicates (5 m×5 m plots). The 63 plots were arranged following a randomized block design, and separated from each other by 1 m buffers. Six levels of N addition (0, 1.75, 5.25, 10.5, 17.5, and 28.0 g N.m −2 .yr −1 ) were created by adding NH 4 NO 3  to plots early July (July 1–5) from 2000. To ensure that N was the only limiting element, following nutrients and trace elements were added: P (10 g P 2 O 5 ·m −2 ·yr −1 ), S (0.2 mg·m −2 ·yr −1 ), Zn (190 µg·m −2 ·yr −1 ), Mn (160 µg· m−2 ·yr −1 ), and B (31 µg·m −2 ·yr −1 ). We also had a set of control plots without any nutrient addition.  At the level of individual plants, we measured the individual biomass (IB), the belowground biomass (BB), and the aboveground biomass (AB). We calculated biomass allocation as follows: Belowground allocation (BA) = BB/IB; Aboveground allocation (AA) = AB/IB. We also computed the coefficients of variations (CVs) in IB, BA and AA as indices of plasticity for these variables. We estimated the biomass response of individuals as: R IB  = ln (IBt/IBc), where IBt and IBc are the mean biomass of individuals in the treatment and control plots, respectively. A positive R IB  value indicates an increase in individual biomass for a given species after N addition. In the same way, we estimated the belowground allocation response (R BA ) and aboveground allocation response (R AA ).  At the species level, we calculated the relative abundance of plant species as: RAB = plant density of a species/plant density of the community. Change in species relative abundance was estimated as: V RAB  = ln (RABt/RABc), where RABt and RABc are the mean relative abundance of a given species in treatment and control plots, respectively. Similarly, we calculated the species richness change at the community level.  Considering that the measurements of variables for co-occurring species in the same plot may not be completely independent, we used linear mixed models to test the overall effects of species, N addition rate, and their interaction. For each species, we also carried out separate ANOVAs to examine the effects of N addition rates. Duncan's multiple range tests at a significance level of 0.05 were used for multiple comparisons.  Bars are means ± s.d. Different letters between treatments indicate statistically significant differences determined by Duncan's multiple comparison.  Bars are means ± s.d.

Numbers with the same letter are not statistically different at the significance level of 0.05.  Unfilled bars represent aboveground allocations and solid bars represent belowground allocations. Bars are means ± s.d. Different letters between treatments indicate statistically significant differences determined by Duncan's multiple comparison.  Our results also suggest that there are hierarchical linkages between the responses at different organizational levels, and the changes at higher organizational levels can be explained by the responses at lower organizational levels. First, the divergent responses at the species level provide a biological basis for explaining plant diversity loss at the community level. Specifically, our study indicates that the decline of perennial bunchgrasses and forbs, which dominate the Eurasian grasslands, was the dominant reason for the observed community-level species loss after N addition. Second, changes in species relative abundance were closely related to responses of individual biomass and belowground allocation. Moreover, we found that species-level changes were positively correlated with aboveground allocation pattern but negatively with belowground allocation pattern. These results suggest that both ecological functions and evolutionary strategies of species have important effects on species-level responses to N addition.  Although our results are based on a short-term experiment, the main conclusion that the increased aboveground competition is the primary mechanism for species loss following N addition in the Inner Mongolia grassland seems robust regardless of time scales as long as N enrichment continues. Our findings from this study have several implications for predicting the dynamics of plant diversity in grasslands with increasing N deposition and for the management practices of these ecosystems. In the Inner Mongolia grassland, perennial grasses are dominant species with well developed root systems that allow them to cope with environmental stresses, such as long-term drought and low N availability. N addition, however, ameliorates or even removes such limitation, thus disrupting the balance between above- and belowground allocations of resources. This disruption may lead to a decline of perennial grasses and forbs, and subsequently a shift in species dominance from perennial grasses to annuals. Such changes in community structure will inevitably result in alterations in ecosystem function and services, and reduce the resilience of these systems to climate change. Thus, controlling N enrichment from anthropogenic sources seems a necessary strategy for maintaining the biodiversity and ecosystem functioning of the Eurasian natural grasslands.
