Arctic species of the cheilostome bryozoan Microporella, with a redescription of the type speciesThis investigation focuses on the diversity and taxonomy of species of Microporella found north of the Arctic Circle. Firstly, however, a neotype is chosen for the Mediterranean type species M. ciliata (Pallas) in order to stabilize the taxonomy of this â€œpseudocosmopolitanâ€ species, which has been recorded in the past from the Arctic. Study of type and other material using scanning electron microscopy shows that only two Arctic species of Microporella can be recognized, M. arctica Norman and M. klugei sp. nov. The first of these is characterized by a large ascopore divided by thin radial septa and situated close to the proximal rim of the orifice. Microporella klugei sp. nov. differs in having a smaller, undivided ascopore situated in a more proximal position on the frontal shield. Both Arctic species are notable among Microporella species for having a high proportion of autozooids without associated avicularia.
