Here, an assessment was carried out by comparing the responses of invasive and native species to thermal stress. The goal was to identify physiological patterns that facilitate invasion success and to investigate whether these traits are widespread among invasive ectotherms. Four hypotheses were generated and tested using a review of the literature to determine whether they could be supported across taxonomically diverse invasive organisms. The four hypotheses are as follows: (i) broad geographical temperature tolerances (thermal width) confer a higher upper thermal tolerance threshold for invasive rather than native species; (ii) the upper thermal extreme experienced in nature is more highly correlated with upper thermal tolerance threshold for invasive vs. native animals; (iii) protein chaperone expressionâ€”a cellular mechanism that underlies an organism's thermal tolerance thresholdâ€”is greater in invasive organisms than in native ones; and (iv) acclimation to higher temperatures can promote a greater range of thermal tolerance for invasive compared with native species. Each hypothesis was supported by a meta-analysis of the invasive/thermal physiology literature, providing further evidence that physiology plays a substantial role in the establishment of invasive ectotherms.One of the fundamental questions in invasion ecology is what makes an invading species successful (Elton, 1958). Over 50â€…years of research addressing this question has illustrated that a variety of life-history traits and other biological characteristics promote invasion success. For example, generalist predatory habits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C81">Snyder and Evans, 2006</xref>), dynamic population growth after an initial lag period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C77">Sakai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>) and superior competitive ability relative to native organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C8">Callaway and Ridenour, 2004</xref>) are among several of the components that have been shown to facilitate the establishment of non-native species.To date, much of the research conducted on invasive species has taken the ecosystem- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C34">Gordon, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C24">Dukes and Mooney, 2004</xref>) or community-level approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C52">Kourtev <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C78">Sanders <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), describing the impacts that invaders have on native flora and fauna from a broad-scale perspective. This work has developed and tested hypotheses that have brought about significant advances in our understanding of the unintended consequences of human-mediated invasions. There are, however, many questions that remain unanswered. Despite the extensive literature on the role that physiology has played in the shaping of evolutionary trajectories and biogeographical distributions of native species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C82">Somero, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C83">2005</xref>), there has, until recently, been a dearth of studies that aim to evaluate the physiology of non-native species. Ecophysiology of invasive species is an emerging field that drives to illuminate the physiological mechanisms that play a role in the establishment of non-native species. Narrative reviews of invasion physiology and niche modelling have provided anecdotal evidence of mechanisms that have had broad taxonomic success, but the empirical support for such mechanisms is lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C72">PyÅ¡ek and Richardson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C46">JimÃ©nez-Valverde <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).In order for invaders to become established in a recipient environment, they must first pass through the â€˜ecological filterâ€™ of that environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C16">Crowl <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The ecological filter is composed of two major components, the biotic and the abiotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C16">Crowl <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Invaders new to a recipient habitat must be able to maintain performance and fitness with respect to species interactions such as competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C54">Levine <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) and predation (deRivera <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005); failing to do so can prevent establishment or further range expansion. Likewise, for the abiotic component, successful establishment requires invaders to tolerate, through physiological adjustments, abiotic stressors such as temperature, desiccation and disturbance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C66">Olyarnik <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Abiotic parameters have been shown to serve as the first â€˜ecological filterâ€™ to invasion by non-natives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C66">Olyarnik <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) and have been proven to prohibit the establishment of invasive populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C42">Holway <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C32">Gerhardt and Collinge, 2007</xref>). In some cases, abiotic factors can have a greater impact on invasion success than biotic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C22">Dethier and Hacker, 2005</xref>).Temperature is often regarded as the most important abiotic factor in determining species distribution owing to its impact on biochemical and cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C82">Somero, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C83">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C47">Johnston and Bennett, 2008</xref>), which, in turn, affect organismal performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C69">PÃ¶rtner, 2002</xref>). Particularly for ectotherms, understanding how an invading organism might respond to variations in environmental temperature can bring about significant insight regarding the patterns and processes of species invasion. Organismal, cellular, genetic and metabolic processes, each play a part in setting the limits of physiological tolerance and are differentially regulated depending on the intensity and amplitude of environmental stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C71">Prosser, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C47">Johnston and Bennett, 2008</xref>). A rich history of research on the thermal physiology of native species provides many measurements that characterize the upper thermal tolerance threshold (UTT) of a species or population, such as LT<sub>50</sub>/CTmax (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C59">Lutterschmidt and Hutchison, 1997</xref>), and these techniques have recently been applied to the study of invasive species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C49">Kelley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C94">Zerebecki and Sorte, 2011</xref>). These measurements allow a comparison of physiological tolerances both within and among species, and can be used to highlight the physiological differences that may exist between native and invasive organisms.This review provides a framework in which physiology is used to increase our understanding of the mechanisms that influence the successful establishment of non-native organisms. Here, I compare the responses of invasive organisms (those species that have become successfully established in novel environments) vs. native species (those species that have never become established beyond their native habitat ranges). While many organisms (native and non-native alike) use these physiological responses, they are commonly found among invaders and are likely to help such species overcome potential abiotic resistance of recipient habitats. Many of the invasive and native species included in this review do co-occur in areas, while some do not. The goal is to determine empirically what physiological phenotypes invaders have in common, across taxa and habitat types. In doing so, species that have these physiological phenotypes can be identified, and their potential distribution to new habitats monitored by scientists and resource managers alike. I examined four related hypotheses that are not mutually exclusive. The rationale for each hypothesis is explained below.Theoretical diagrams graphically illustrating key concepts. Blue lines/dots represent native species and red lines/dots represent invasive species.

(<bold>D</bold>)â€…Hypothesisâ€…3; a graph showing the shift in laboratory-measured UTT after acclimation to a higher temperature, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C14">Claussen (1977)</xref>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C94">Zerebecki and Sorte (2011)</xref> tested the hypothesis that the geographical temperature range (thermal width) that an organism experiences is related to that organism's upper thermal tolerance threshold. Their work compared a small number of invasive and native marine sessile benthic invertebrates in Bodega Harbor, CA, USA, and found that the invasive species, in general, had broader thermal widths as well as higher UTTs when compared with the native species in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C94">Zerebecki and Sorte, 2011</xref>). Here, I test for concordance of this hypothesis, comparing range widths and UTTs of native and invasive species representing many taxonimic groups, with the <italic>a priori</italic> expectation that invasive species will have a wider thermal width that is more positively correlated with a higher UTT than for native species (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU045F1">1</xref>B).It has been reported that animals that experience high environmental temperatures have UTTs that are strongly correlated with their respective environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C89">Stillman and Somero, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C94">Zerebecki and Sorte, 2011</xref>). Invasive species often have UTTs that exceed what is physiologically necessary for the environment that they inhabit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C39">Hofmann and Somero, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C2">Braby, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C91">Tomanek and Zuzow, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C94">Zerebecki and Sorte, 2011</xref>). This review examines the hypothesis that the relationship between the highest habitat temperature experienced and the UTT is more positively correlated for non-native species than for native ones (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU045F1">1</xref>C).Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are molecular chaperones that aid in the refolding of macromolecules that have become denatured due to heat and other stressors (Lindquist, 1986; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C26">Feder and Hofmann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C28">Fink, 1999</xref>). Much work evaluating the functional significance of these protein chaperones has led to a clear understanding of their ecological importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C38">Hochachka and Somero, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C82">Somero, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C83">2005</xref>). The expression of these gene products is thought to be integral to the setting of organismal thermal tolerance limits, and they have been used as molecular indicators to compare the capacity of organisms to tolerate thermal stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C90">Tomanek and Somero, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C38">Hochachka and Somero, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C82">Somero, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C83">2005</xref>). Induction of HSPs is theorized to be greater for invasive organisms relative to native species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C94">Zerebecki and Sorte, 2011</xref>); however, this trend has not yet been identified across taxa. Additionally, it is hypothesized that invaders have a higher HSP induction temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>on</sub>) and maximal expression temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub>) than native species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C39">Hofmann and Somero, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C2">Braby, 2004</xref>).The ability of an organism to make physiological adjustments that alter its thermal tolerance threshold after exposure to different thermal regimes is referred to as acclimation and has been thoroughly explored in the scientific literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C23">Dietz and Somero, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C6">Buckley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C4">Braby and Somero 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C92">Wada and Matsukura, 2007</xref>). It is hypothesized that invaders have the faculty to provide a greater increase to their UTT after acclimation to a warmer temperature than do native species (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU045F1">1</xref>D). This physiological mechanism may allow an invader to maintain physiological function over a wider range of temperatures relative to a native species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C13">Chown <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C80">Slabber <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C40">Hofmann and Todgham, 2010</xref>).Glossary of termsTo test the hypothesis that temperature tolerance increases with thermal width, a regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between the thermal width (the difference between the upper and lower temperature range experienced by the organism in the environment) and the UTT of native and invasive organisms (as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C94">Zerebecki and Sorte, 2011</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU045F1">1</xref>B). Student's unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test was then conducted to compare the thermal width between native and invasive species. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/conphys/cou045/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link> lists the species, general taxonomy, upper and lower environmental thermal limits (in degrees Celsius), thermal range (in degrees Celsius), UTT (in degrees Celsius), origin (native or invasive), acclimation temperature (in degrees Celsius), rate of thermal ramping, life stage and citation(s) for the above data. When multiple temperature ramping rates were used in a study or when different UTT values for one species were found in the literature, the highest UTT value that was recorded was used. For example, <italic>Dreissena polymorpha</italic> and <italic>Dreissena bugensis</italic>, the zebra mussel and quagga mussel, respectively, were tested at several different ramping rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C63">Mills <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>), but the rate that elicited the highest UTT was used in the analysis.A comparison investigating the relationship between the upper environmental temperature experienced <italic>in situ</italic> and the UTT was carried out (as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C89">Stillman and Somero, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C94">Zerebecki and Sorte, 2011</xref>). A regression analysis using these data was used to assess the relationship between upper lethal thermal tolerance and the highest temperature that each species experienced in nature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU045F1">1</xref>C). In order to determine whether UTTs were greater for invasives than natives, Student's unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test was performed. Where applicable, comparisons within taxonomic groups were made between native and non-native species using summary statistics. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/conphys/cou045/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link> lists the upper temperature that each species experiences in nature, as well as the laboratory-derived UTT.Given the methodological inconsistencies of HSP measurements, e.g. mRNA vs. protein expression, a meta-analysis was not possible. However, there are a small number of research articles that directly compare HSP expression between invasive species and their native competitors. These data were used to test the hypothesis that HSP expression is greater in invasive organisms than in native ones. Also reviewed were the temperature at which induction of the heat shock response occurred (<italic>T</italic><sub>on</sub>) and the temperature that produced the greatest expression of HSPs (<italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub>), which have been shown to vary across thermally heterogeneous environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C90">Tomanek and Somero, 1999</xref>).

The mean ARR and standard error for invasives and natives was 0.268â€…Â±â€…0.044 (<italic>n</italic>â€…=â€…18) and 0.086â€…Â±â€…0.065 (<italic>n</italic>â€…=â€…25), respectively. Some native taxonomic groups, e.g. bivalvia, had many negative ARR values (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU045F8">8</xref>). Conversely, invasive teleosts had ARR values that ranged between 0.28 and 0.46, relatively higher than native teleosts, whose ARR values spanned from 0.06 to 0.44 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU045F7">7</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/conphys/cou045/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary Table S3</ext-link>).The organisms in this study that successfully invaded new regions had several key physiological features that potentially broaden their scope of thermal tolerance. It may be that several of these mechanisms acted synergistically to aid invasives in overcoming abiotic constraints present in the recipient environment. Below is a discussion of how each of these mechanisms may be beneficial to invasive organisms and how they are ecologically relevant in the context of invasion success.It should be noted that there are several caveats to this approach, and these results should be viewed with caution. First, the rate of heat ramping was not consistent across all UTT experiments, which is reasonable given the different physiologies of the different taxa considered in this review. Second, the acclimation times varied between a week and a month. Variations in either of these parameters can affect the final UTT value, and there are insufficient data to use thermal ramping rate and acclimation temperature as covariates in an analysis. Here, as with the other predictions, the intent is to start examining these mechanisms across taxa to identify the most promising avenues for future experimentation and research.The multispecies comparison revealed that higher temperature tolerance was positively related to the thermal width for invasive but not native species (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU045F2">2</xref>). The eurythermality of these non-native species, perhaps a byproduct of their fundamental niche, is likely to have played a critical role in their establishment. The fundamental niche of a species can be described as the combination of abiotic variables in which an organism can maintain a population without immigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C41">Holt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). For successful invaders, the abiotic constraints these species were exposed to in the recipient range often bore great similarity to the abiotic parameters experienced in their ancestral range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C41">Holt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C93">Wiens and Graham, 2005</xref>). For some invasive species, the niche occupied in the recipient range is nearly identical to that occupied in their home range, as is the case for the invasive decapod <italic>Hemigrapsus sanguineus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C57">Lohrer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). The opposite is true for the invasive green crab, <italic>Carcinus maenas</italic>, as this invasive decapod has invaded variable and spatially disjunct abiotic habitats (Grosholz and Ruiz, 1996). Furthermore, environmental niche modelling has shown that the invasive range of <italic>Carcinus maenas</italic> extends beyond what would be predicted by the native range alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C15">Compton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Nonetheless, when the ancestral environmental niche is broad, invasive organisms are capable of occupying a wide range of abiotic habitats, which is likely to be a key element in establishing viable, self-sustaining populations in novel habitats.Other studies examining broad thermal ranges (eurytolerance) and invasion success report results similar to the ones found in this study. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C64">Moyle and Marchetti (2006)</xref> found that among invasive fishes in California, 66% of successful invasions were found to be fish that were extremely tolerant to high temperatures relative to native species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C64">Moyle and Marchetti, 2006</xref>). Also in the genus <italic>Mytilus</italic>, the invasive <italic>Mytilus galloprovincialis</italic> exhibited a thermal niche reflective of its home range (broad thermal range, high UTT), which allowed this species to outcompete the native <italic>Mytilus edulus</italic> at the edge of the <italic>Mytilus edulus</italic> range, facilitating a cryptic invasion along the central Californian coast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C2">Braby, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C3">Braby and Somero, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C4">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C55">Lockwood and Somero, 2011</xref>).An invasive organism's ancestral thermal niche, characterized by a discrete thermal range, has been shown to modulate physiological performance on several levels of biological organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C82">Somero, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C83">2005</xref>). From a molecular standpoint, environmental temperature plays a key role in organismal performance due to its impacts on enzyme kinetics, enzymeâ€“substrate affinity, cell membrane viscosity and the pool of enzymes capable of operating across the thermal range experienced by an organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C38">Hochachka and Somero, 2002</xref>). A loss of function in any of these molecular processes can affect organismal performance, indicating that an invasive organism may be maladapted to the new environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C38">Hochachka and Somero, 2002</xref>).For invasives, an observable trend was identified between the upper thermal temperature experienced <italic>in situ</italic> and the corresponding UTT (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>â€…=â€…0.5; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU045F3">3</xref>). This study indicates that many invasive species had UTT values that were similar to the upper thermal boundaries present in their ancestral range, allowing them to function closer to their absolute thermal threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C89">Stillman and Somero, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C83">Somero, 2005</xref>). This is especially true for intertidal ectotherms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C38">Hochachka and Somero, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C48">Jones <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The prior habitat characteristics of an invading species can influence the capacity for establishment. For example, intertidal species occupy habitats that vary widely with regard to temperature, salinity, ultraviolet exposure and many other abiotic parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C18">Dayton, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C68">Paine and Levin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C62">Menge and Sutherland, 1987</xref>). The occupation of such dynamic environments has led to the evolution of high thermal tolerance thresholds that leave these species poised to pass through the abiotic filter and become established, if introduced to new environments. Many invasive species identified in this review hail from the intertidal range, including <italic>Mytilus galloprovinciallis</italic>, <italic>Carcinus maenas</italic>, <italic>Botryllus schlosseri</italic> and <italic>Didemnum vexillum</italic>.Although there was no statistical difference between UTTs for native and invasive ectotherms, this is perhaps an artifact of the uneven taxonomic comparison. Many of the native species used in this comparison are terrestrial ectotherms, whereas the majority of invasive species are derived from aquatic habitats (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/conphys/cou045/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link>). However, this result makes sense in that the majority of the native species used in the analysis are terrestrial arthropods, a group that has been shown to have high temperature tolerances due to the lack of thermal buffering that is present in aquatic environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C69">PÃ¶rtner, 2002</xref>). The results of the present analysis are similar to those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C87">Sorte <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref>, who found that invasive species were less affected by increases in environmental temperature (as a product of climate change) than native species in aquatic but not terrestrial environments. The results of both studies highlight the difference in upper lethal thermal limits between terrestrial and aquatic ectotherms, with only the aquatic invasive species tending to have a physiological advantage over native ones.Pairwise comparisons between closely related species found that invasives, in general, had higher UTTs than native species. For example, the invasive <italic>Mytilus galloprovincialis</italic> had an upper critical thermal temperature that was 3 and 4Â°C higher than the native <italic>Mytilus trossulus</italic> after acclimation to 14 and 21Â°C, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C4">Braby and Somero, 2006b</xref>). This was also the case for springtails from the sub-Antarctic Marion Islands; the invasive springtail <italic>Ceratophysella denticulata</italic> exhibited an UTT of 35.4Â°C after acclimation to 0.1Â°C, while the native <italic>Cryptopygus antarcticus</italic> had a lower UTT, 32.7Â°C, after acclimation to 1.2Â°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C80">Slabber <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).Owing to the small number of studies available, the statistical power of the pairwise comparisons of protein chaperone expression is low; nevertheless, the expression levels between native and invasive organisms revealed distinct differences in <italic>T</italic><sub>on</sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> among three classes of heat shock proteins. Below, the functional significance of each HSP is examined, with a discussion of how variation in the expression of these HSPs can affect physiological performance, thereby potentially affecting invasion success.The inducible isoform of Hsp70 has been widely studied within an ecological context and is thought to be crucial to the establishment and maintenance of the upper thermal tolerance threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C86">SÃ¸rensen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Indeed, this study showed that <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> was between 2 and 15Â°C higher for invasive species than for native species (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/conphys/cou045/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link>), indicating that invasives had a greater ability to withstand increased thermal stress. Moreover, non-native species had a higher, <italic>T</italic><sub>on</sub> than natives (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/conphys/cou045/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link>). For invasive bivalves and hemiptera, <italic>T</italic><sub>on</sub> was 2Â°C higher, while for macrophytes, <italic>T</italic><sub>on</sub> was 5Â°C higher for invasives vs. natives (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/conphys/cou045/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link>). These results suggest that the invasive organisms investigated were more tolerant to heat stress in terms of both intensity and duration, as indicated by the higher <italic>T</italic><sub>on</sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> temperatures. This response may directly support a higher UTT for invasive species, which, in turn, would allow invasives to maintain physiological function at higher environmental temperatures when compared with native species that occupy the same habitat. These results are congruent with work conducted on congeners of the native <italic>Tegula</italic> (marine intertidal snail), where those species that inhabited the upper intertidal zone, and consequently experienced a greater frequency and magnitude of heat stress, had a higher <italic>T</italic><sub>on</sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> than those species that occupied the mid to low intertidal zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C90">Tomanek and Somero, 1999</xref>). Although the present analysis included only four species, the taxonomic breadth covered was quite broad and captured the response of organisms from four major clades, namely hemiptera, tunicata, bivalvia and macrophyte.Heat shock proteinâ€…20 has been shown to be responsive to both heat and osmotic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C53">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C35">Gracey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The results presented here demonstrate the role that Hsp20 plays as a stress response in two distinct taxa, hemiptera and bivalvia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU045F5">5</xref>). For both clades, the invasive species had a greater maximal induction than the native congener (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU045F5">5</xref>). Functionally, Hsp20 has been shown to inhibit apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C1">Beere, 2004</xref>), and from a mechanistic standpoint, it acts as a chaperone involved in the maintenance of cytoskeletal structure during bouts of environmental stress (Derham and Harding, 1999). In addition, Hsp20 ameliorates the cytotoxic protein aggregation that occurs during heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C43">Horwitz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C44">Horwitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>). For hemiptera, the <italic>T</italic><sub>on</sub> of Hsp20 was the same for both native and invasive species, 37Â°C (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/conphys/cou045/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link>). The <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> for the invasive hemiptera was 41Â°C, 3Â°C higher than the native species (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/conphys/cou045/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link>). Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C56">Lockwood <italic>et al.</italic> (2010)</xref> found that of all HSPs available, only Hsp20 was upregulated in the warm-adapted, invasive <italic>Mytilus galloprovincialis</italic> when compared with the native <italic>Mytilus trossulus</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU045F5">5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C56">Lockwood <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Hence, upregulation of a single HSP class protein may, in part, confer a higher UTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C4">Braby and Somero, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C55">Lockwood and Somero, 2011</xref>), highlighting the impact that a single HSP class can have in extending the UTT of an organism.The role of Hsp90 as a molecular chaperone has been well documented (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C70">Pratt, 1998</xref>). Heat shock proteinâ€…90 overlaps functionally with Hsp70 and is also involved in cell signalling pathways, transcriptional regulation and cell cycle control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C70">Pratt, 1998</xref>). Heat shock proteinâ€…90 is an important mediator of continued cell cycle progression during bouts of thermal stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C60">McClellan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). In stressful conditions, the ability of an organism to continue cell proliferation (facilitated by the expression of Hsp90) may give an invasive organism a physiological advantage over a native competitor. In hemiptera, Hsp90 expression was significantly greater in the invasive <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> biotypeâ€…Q than in its native congener (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU045F6">6</xref>). Like the Hsp20 expression in this taxonomic group, Hsp90 had the same <italic>T</italic><sub>on</sub>, at 35Â°C, but the <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> was 2Â°C higher for <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> biotypeâ€…Q than for the native <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> biotype ZHJ1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/conphys/cou045/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link>).Taken together, these results indicate that the non-native species had greater expression levels in all HSP classes investigated (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU045F4">4</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU045F6">6</xref>). Furthermore, the studies reviewed showed that in every case, the invaders had a higher UTT, which directly corresponded to higher HSP expression levels in this group.The ability of ectotherms to make adjustments to organismal thermal tolerance via acclimation has been widely explored and is thought to allow species to persist across highly variable spatiotemporal thermal landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C79">Segal, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C45">Hutchison and Maness, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C76">Roberts <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C33">GonzÃ¡lez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). The ARRs for invasive species were higher than for the native species examined (0.268â€…Â±â€…0.044, <italic>n</italic>â€…=â€…18 and 0.0859â€…Â±â€…0.0649 <italic>n</italic>â€…=â€…25, respectively; <italic>P</italic>â€…=â€…0.04). Results from the present study indicate a divergent response to acclimation. Invasive organisms in all acclimatory conditions increased their UTT after acclimation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU045F7">7</xref>). Native species, in contrast, expressed a variety of responses to acclimation; some responded positively, like <italic>Mytilus trossulus</italic>, some responded negatively, as seen in <italic>Ellipsaria lineolata</italic>, and some made no adjustments to their organismal thermal tolerance after acclimation, e.g. <italic>Alasmidonta varicose</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU045F8">8</xref>). One possible reason why some native species responded with negative ARR values to higher acclimation (and a resulting lower UTT) is that the higher acclimation temperatures were stressful and very near the UTTs of those species, potentially preventing them from mounting a robust physiological response to acute heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C89">Stillman and Somero, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C88">Stillman, 2003</xref>). Moreover, it has been noted that invasive species tend to be more tolerant of high temperatures, and native species are more tolerant of low temperatures when comparing the two across a recipient range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C4">Braby and Somero, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C80">Slabber <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). In this scenario, increases in environmental temperature via global climate change may be less problematic or even beneficial for some invasive species, in contrast to native ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C84">Somero, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C85">2012</xref>).Acclimatory induced shifts in organismal thermal tolerance are underscored by a broad suite of molecular level processes. These processes include the following: a modification in the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C30">Fowler and Thomashow, 2002</xref>); a variation in phase behaviour of the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C37">Hazel, 1995</xref>); and a change in the specific isozyme used, to conserve the kinetic activities of <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> (Michaelis constant) and <italic>K</italic><sub>cat</sub> (the number of substrate molecules that can be converted to product) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C38">Hochachka and Somero, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C27">Fields <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). For the regionally endothermic bluefin tuna, <italic>Thunnus orientalis</italic>, acclimation to two different temperatures prompted a shift in the gene expression, where genes involved in protein biosynthesis, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism were upregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C12">Castilho <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, thermal acclimation facilitated reordering of the glycerophospholipids within the lipid bilayer, which helped to maintain membrane function at different temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C67">Overgaard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C27">Fields <italic>et al.</italic> (2006)</xref> compared <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>cat</sub> values of malate dehydrogenase orthologues between the invasive <italic>Mytilus galloprovincialis</italic> and the native <italic>Mytilus trossulus.</italic> This work discovered that the native <italic>Mytilus trossulus</italic> had higher <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub><sup>NADH</sup> (where NADH is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and <italic>K</italic><sub>cat</sub> values of malate dehydrogenase, which pointed to a lower substrate affinity and a higher catalytic rate, reflecting an adaptation to colder temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C27">Fields <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).The ability of an invasive organism to acclimate and make physiological adjustments that maintain performance across a range of temperatures is integral to overcoming abiotic resistance within recipient environments. For invasive ectotherms, abiotic constraints pose a substantial barrier that must be surmounted in order for invasive populations to become established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C42">Holway <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C32">Gerhardt and Collinge, 2007</xref>). For cases when the physiological cost of acclimation inhibits performance, the invader would be at a physiological disadvantage when competing with a native species and would be likely not to establish.In a broader context, distinguishing physiological traits that are common among successful invaders can identify biological characteristics that may predispose a species to become established if introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C75">Ricciardi and Rasmussen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C51">Kolar and Lodge, 2001</xref>). In doing so, particular attention can be paid to prevent such species from becoming introduced, or their spread from the zone of introduction can be minimized. For example, the considerable ecological and economic cost that the non-native zebra mussel (<italic>Dreissena polymorpha</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C58">Ludyanskiy <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>) has imposed on the Great Lakes region of the United States has spurred a national interest in the prevention of further expansion of this species. Both federal and local agencies have protocols in place to prohibit the further spread of this prolific invader. The zebra mussel is highly fecund, a trait associated with invasion success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C65">Nalepa and Schloesser, 1993</xref>). The Great Lakes may have been less impacted by the zebra mussel if recreational users had been screened for aquatic hitchhikers that exhibited the trait of high fecundity.Concerning physiological phenotypes that have been correlated with invasion success, an effort can be made by resource managers to identify species that have the physiological capacity to tolerate the abiotic conditions present in the areas they manage. Moreover, if invaders are detected in new habitats, the physiological parameters that these animals exhibit can be used to make predictions concerning their probable distribution within the context of the new environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C17">Crozier, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU045C50">Kelley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). The over-arching goal of such predictions is to identify potential areas for invasion or range expansion, prevent the establishment non-native species or allow some degree of management of these species once a population has been established. It has been shown that attempts at eradication have a greater degree of success when populations are recently established and relatively small (de Rivera <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006).The work presented here has identified a methodological approach that compares and elucidates physiological differences between native and invasive species. Nonetheless, it has granted only a correlative relationship between physiological traits that differ between these two groups. Though general trends have been highlighted here, a direct assessment of native and invasive competitors from both aquatic and terrestrial habitats subjected to identical laboratory acclimation, heat ramping rate and upper lethal threshold protocols would further strengthen the support for these hypotheses. This review also establishes the need for further investigations that include more representation from vertebrate and terrestrial species. Additionally, inquiries that look at how invasive organisms might respond to global climate change and what their potential impacts might be on native species, communities and ecosystems need to be undertaken.<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/conphys/cou045/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary material is available at <italic>Conservation Physiology</italic> online</ext-link>.Financial support was provided by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Grant to A.L.K., grant number 220005, and a National Science Foundation GK-12 Graduate Fellowship to A.L.K., National Science Foundation grant number 0948041.I would like to thank Drâ€…Catherine de Rivera and Drâ€…Jay Lunden for their helpful suggestions on the manuscript.
