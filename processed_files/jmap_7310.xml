Seasonal fluctuations in the flight activity of aquatic Heteroptera (Nepomorpha) on Barro Colorado Island, Panam√°Flight activity seasonalities of seven waterbug species (aquatic Heteroptera) were analysed using light‚Ätrap data from Barro Colorado Island, Panam√°. Three species only made important dispersal flights at the beginning of the rainy season; one species only at the beginning and at the end. Two made flights throughout the rainy season. The flight activity of one species was randomly distributed over the year. Most flight activity patterns could be interpreted in terms of adaptations for colonizing temporary habitats. The distribution of waterbug flying season durations seems to resemble those of Sphingidae, Homoptera, and Blattaria from the same area, but the most important flight activity of waterbugs seems to be more concentrated in shorter periods.
