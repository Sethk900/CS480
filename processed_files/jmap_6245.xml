A comparison of culture methods for tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) anthersThree different anther culture methods for the South African tobacco cultivars C11 Ã— WOSB and CDL 28 were tested. The yield of haploid plantlets produced using a solidified or double-layer medium was significantly higher than with the use of a liquid culture medium. The former two media showed no significant differences. Important considerations which must be taken into account when deciding on the optimum culture method for anther cultures are also discussed.
