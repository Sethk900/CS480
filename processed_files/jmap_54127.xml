Strengths of a densipan, humus-pan and clay-pan in a Spodosol developed under kauri (Agathis australis) and the implications for soil classificationThree hard layers have formed in a Spodosol developed on aeolian coastal sands under the influence of litter from kauri (Agathis australis). A densipan in the albic horizon and a humus-pan in the spodic horizon slaked in water whereas a clay-pan in a buried soil only softened in 1 M HCl. Blocks sawn from these three pans showed a maximum of unconfined compressive strength in the humus-pan. Specimens made from remoulded pan materials with minimum compaction developed only a proportion of the original strength. Greater compaction enhanced the strength of all three materials. Raising the pH during remoulding caused a marked increase in strength, but above pH 10.5 all the pan materials lost strength when silicate was solubilised from surfaces of clay and quartz particles. Scanning electron micrographs showed that the densipan was a close-fit configuration of sand- and silt-sized quartz particles that attained a high density without cementation of particles. In the humus-pan organic matter bridged across a third of the surfaces of the quartz particles and prevented a close-fit configuration. The clay-pan below the spodic horizon had all its particles thickly coated with clay and humus and these were aggregated into an open-fit arrangement of lower density. According to Soil Taxonomy procedures, the Te Kopuru sand lies within the Aquod sub-group of Spodosols. In the absence of a non-slaking duripan it was the presence of a fragipan below the spodic horizon that directed the soil into being a Fragiaquod. It is the densipan in the albic horizon above the spodic horizon, however, that controls plant roots and cannot be ignored in soil classification. We suggest that a new great group, Densiaquod, be recognized for these soils.
