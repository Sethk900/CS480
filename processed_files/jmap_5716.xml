Description of two new freeâ€living marine nematode species of the subgenus Desmolorenzenia (Desmoscolecida, genus Desmoscolex) from KoreaTwo new species of marine desmoscolecid nematodes, Desmoscolex (Desmolerenzenia) coreensis sp. nov. and D. (D.) pedunculus sp. nov., are described based on specimens obtained from the washings of shallow sublittoral invertebrates from the eastern and southern coasts of Korea. Both species possess 17 desmens and a typical setal pattern. Desmoscolex (D.) coreensis sp. nov. is most similar to D. (D.) hupferi (Steiner, 1916) in the number of desmens, setal pattern, and head shape, but differs by the structure of the cephalic setae, the cylindrically elongated end ring, and a lower â€œcâ€ value. Desmoscolex (D.) pedunculus sp. nov. is closely related to D. (D.) crassicauda (Timm, 1970) in the number of desmens, setal pattern, subdorsal setae inserted on a peduncle, and a similarly shaped end ring, but is easily discernible by the globular head shape, the distinctly differentiated lip region and the position of the cephalic setae, centrally on the head capsule.
