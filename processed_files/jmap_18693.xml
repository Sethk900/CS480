Effects of pasture introduction on soil CO2 emissions during the dry season in the state of Rondonia, BrazilSoil CO2 evolution rates, soil temperatures and moisture were measured during the dry season in two forest-to-pasture chronosequences in Rondonia, Brazil. The study included pastures ranging from 3 to 80 years-old. Mean dry-season CO2 evolution from the forest in chronosequence I, 88.8 mg CO2-C m(-2) h(-1) was lower than from the pastures which ranged from 111 to 158 mg CO2-C m(-2)h(-1). We found that temperature was not a good predictor of CO2 emissions from pasture but that there was a significant relationship (r = 0.72, p < 0.05) between soil moisture and pasture emissions. The delta(13)C of the soil CO2 emissions also was measured on chronosequence I; delta(13)C of the CO2 emitted from the C-3 forest was -29.43 parts per thousand. Pasture (CO2)-C-13 delta values increased from -17.91 parts per thousand in the 3 year-old pasture to -12.86 parts per thousand in the 80 year-old, reflecting the increasing C-4 inputs with pasture age. Even in the youngest(3 year-old) pasture, 70 percent of the CO2 evolved originated from C-4 pasture-derived carbon.
