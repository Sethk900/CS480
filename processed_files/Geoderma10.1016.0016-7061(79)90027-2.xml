Inositol phosphate esters in some surface soils of  Bangladesh. Geoderma, 22: 315--321.    Concentrations of inositol mono-, di- and tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexaphosphate ranged  from 5.0 to 12.5, 10.0 to 27.6, 20.0 to 45.0, 22.5 to 64.6, and 20.0 to 275.4 ppm, res-  pectively, in samples of soils that were poorly drained and mostly derived from alluvium.  Multiple correlation suggested that the amounts of esters of inositol phosphate other than  inositol monophosphate were significantly correlated with organic phosphorus, total  phosphorus, organic carbon, total nitrogen, inositol phospate, clay, exchangeable iron  and aluminium, and pH. Individually, inositolhexa-, penta-, and di- and triphosphates  were significantly correlated with organic phosphorus, total phosphorus, organic carbon,  total nitrogen, inositol phosphate, and exchangeable iron and aluminium; inositol tetra-  phosphate with organic carbon, total nitrogen, inositol phosphate, and exchangeable  iron and aluminium; inositol monophosphate with none.    INTRODUCTION    A significant proportion of the organic phosphorus in soil has been found  to occur as inositol phosphate (Cosgrove, 1967). The observed concentra-  tions differed with the type of soil, mode of extraction and presence of  other soil constituents (McKercher and Anderson, 1968). Moreover, frac-  tionation studies of hydrolysis products of inositol phosphate indicated that  this compound yields six esters (mono- to hexaphosphate of inositol)  (Anderson and Malcolm, 1974), but little has been done to estimate their  amounts in soils.  An attempt was made to determine the relative amounts of inositol phos-  phate esters and the relationships of those with selected soil properties in  some surface softs of Bangladesh. Amounts of inositol phosphates were also  estimated by two different methods.

(1954); exchangeable iron by the method  of Olson (1965); exchangeable aluminium by the method of McLean {1965),  and inositol phosphate esters by the method of Anderson and Malcolm  (1974). Extraction and estimation of inositol phosphate were by the  methods of Anderson (1964) and McKercher and Anderson (1968).

The values ob-  tained in the present study compared well with the findings of Anderson  (1964), Omotoso and Wild (1970) and Islam and Ahmed (1973). The quan-  tities of inositol phosphate determined by Anderson's procedure were slight-  ly lower, presumably because of incomplete precipitation, than those deter-  mined by the method of McKercher and Anderson. Anderson (1964) also  reported similar amounts of inositol penta- and hexaphosphate in some  British softs by these two methods.    Distribution of inositol phosphates    Amounts of inositol mono-, di- and tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexaphosphate  ranged between 5.0 and 12.5, 10.0 and 27.6, 20.0 and 45.0, 22.5 and 64.6,  and 20.0 and 275.4 ppm, respectively (Table IV). These components com-  prised 1.8--10.9, 6.5--15.8, 8.1--29.5, 15.4--27.3, and 18.2--65.6% of the  inositol phosphate, respectively, and 1.3--6.7, 4.0--11.0, 5.0--18.1, 9.4--  17.3 and 11.1--49.2% of the organic phosphorus contents of the soft sam-  ples, respectively.  The amounts are comparable to those obtained by other authors. The  lower forms of esters (mono-, di- and triphosphates of inositol) accounted  collectively for 11.4--41.1% of the organic phosphorus in some Iowan soils  (Bower, 1945) and more than 50% in some Scottish soils (Anderson, 1967).  In contrast, lower values of 1--7% in New Zealand soils (Martin and Wicken,  1966), less than 3% in Nigerian soils (Omotoso and Wild, 1970) and about  2.4% in Aberdeenshire softs (Anderson and Malcolm, 1974) have also been  reported. Inositol hexaphosphate ranged from 3 to 52% of the organic phos-  phorus in some British soils (Caldwell and Black, 1958a) and from 26 to 35%  in Alberta soils (Thomas and Lynch, 1960).

Multiple  correlations suggested that all these factors contributed to differing amounts  of the esters except inositol monophosphate. Individually, inositol hexa- and  pentaphosphates were significantly correlated with organic phosphorus, total  phosphorus, organic carbon, total nitrogen, inositol phosphate and exchange-  able iron and aluminium at the 0.1% level. Inositol tetraphosphate was sig-  nificantly correlated with organic carbon, inositol phosphate, and exchange-  able iron and aluminium at the 5% level and total nitrogen at the 10% level.  Inositol di- and triphosphates together were significantly correlated with or-  ganic phosphorus at the 2% level, inositol phosphate at the 1% level, and  exchangeable iron and aluminium at the 10% level. Inositol monophosphate  was significantly correlated with none of the factors.  Caldwell and Black (1958b) reported that inositol hexaphosphate was  associated to some extent with pH, the content of free iron oxide (Fe), and  the content of organic phosphorus in forms other than inositol hexaphos-  phate in soils. Inositol penta- and hexaphosphates together were significantly  correlated with both organic and total phosphorus and jointly with organic  phosphorus, total phosphorus, organic carbon, total nitrogen and pH of the  soil samples (Islam and Mandal, 1977). Inositol hexaphosphate, like ortho-  phosphate, is known to be strongly absorbed by clay minerals and sesqui-  oxides (Anderson and Arlidge, 1962) and its stability is thought to be    TABLE V    Single and multiple correlation coefficients between inositol phosphate esters and  various soil properties    Soil factors    Correlation coefficient (r) for different inositol phosphate esters    mono   di- and tri- tetra       penta      hexa    Organic p                 -0.110  +0.661*3   +0.469    +0.908*s   +0.974*~  Total p                   -0.153  +0.643*2  +0.494     +0.942*s   +0.989*5  Organic C                 -0.096  +0.626*2   +0.602*2   +0.948*s   +0.969*s  Total N                    -0.099  +0.617*2   +0.564.1   +0.960*s   +0.974*5  Inositol P                  -0.007  +0,727*4   +0.645*2   +0.967*s   +0.994*5  Clay                      -0.395 -0.247    -0.302     +0.191     +0.167  Exchangeable Fe and AI  -0.145  +0.525.1   +0.622*2  +0.953*5   +0.956.s  pH                       -0.253  +0.012    -0.250     +0.159     +0.337  All factors                 +0.389  +0.685*5   +0.862*s   +0.985*s   +0.998*s    *1Denotes significancy at 10% level; *2denotes significancy at 5% level; *3denotes sig-  nificancy at 2% level; *4denotes significancy at 1% level; *Sdenotes significancy at 0.1% level.    321    associated with that behaviour. Evidence from the present study supports  this idea as the esters of inositol, except inositol monophosphate, were sig-  nificantly correlated with exchangeable iron and aluminium and only the  higher esters (penta- and hexaphosphate of inositol) were positively correlat-  ed with clay contents of the samples (Table V).

AbstractConcentrations of inositol mono-, di- and tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexaphosphate ranged from 5.0 to 12.5, 10.0 to 27.6, 20.0 to 45.0, 22.5 to 64.6, and 20.0 to 275.4 ppm, respectively, in samples of soils that were poorly drained and mostly derived from alluvium. Multiple correlation suggested that the amounts of esters of inositol phosphate other than inositol monophosphate were significantly correlated with organic phosphorus, total phosphorus, organic carbon, total nitrogen, inositol phospate, clay, exchangeable iron and aluminium, and pH. Individually, inositol hexa-, penta-, and di- and triphosphates were significantly correlated with organic phosphorus, total phosphorus, organic carbon, total nitrogen, inositol phosphate, and exchangeable iron and aluminium; inositol tetraphosphate with organic carbon, total nitrogen, inositol phosphate, and exchangeable iron and aluminium; inositol monophosphate with none.
