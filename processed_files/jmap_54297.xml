Soil temperature regimes in Cameroon as defined in soil taxonomySoil temperature regimes of Cameroon were estimated from the relationships between mean annual air temperature (MAAT) and mean annual soil temperature (MAST) and their seasonal fluctuations. In the normal range of MAAT in Cameroon (20–30°C), the MAST is 2.3° to 2.6°C higher than the MAAT. The difference between mean summer (MSST) and mean winter soil temperatures (MWST) being always less than 5°C, only isotemperature regimes occur in Cameroon. We estimated that MAST decreases by 0.46°C per 100 m increase in altitude. A provisional soil temperature regime map has been prepared from the estimates, which indicates isohyperthermic temperature regimes as predominant in Cameroon. Isothermic regimes are believed to occur above 1,600 m altitude and isomesic regimes probably above 3,100 m altitude on Mount Cameroon.
