A model for soil CO2 production and transport 1: Model developmentIn this paper, we describe a one-dimensional, process-based model to simulate production and transport of CO2 in soil (PATCIS). The model is used to predict CO2 efflux from the surface and respiration rates within the soil. In the model, gaseous diffusion and liquid phase dispersion are the major mechanisms governing the transport of CO2. The contribution to the CO2 efflux from vertical movements of soil gas and water is also included. In simulating CO2 production, it is assumed that there is no direct interaction between root and soil microbial respiration and that the indirect interactions between them in different soil layers can be specified by their relationship to oxygen concentration in soil gas and the soil carbon pool. Soil temperature, moisture content, O-2 concentration in soil gas, and live and dead biomass are assumed to be direct influencing factors on CO2 efflux or soil respiration. The influence of soil moisture content on CO2 efflux is considered separately through its limitation on respiratory activity (defined by a logistic equation) when soil is dry and its restriction on gas transport when soil is wet. The relationship between soil respiration and soil temperature is described by an Arrhenius equation with the activation energy varying inversely with temperature, and between soil respiration and O-2 concentration in soil gas by a Michaelis-Menten equation.
