A taxonomic review of the Neotropical genus Anchimacheta (Lepidoptera: Urodidae) with descriptions of a new congener and an allied, new genus and species from Sri LankaThe urodid genus Anchimacheta is reviewed by examination of the type species, A. iodes, from Mexico and description of a new congener, A. costaricae n. sp., from Costa Rica. The genus is characterized by having a hind wing vein CuP complete; 1A + 2A vestigial; a male uncus bilobed apically; a female antrum with dentations anteromarginally. Lectotypes are designated for A. iodes and A. capnodes. A new genus, Glaucotunica n. gen., is proposed on the basis of a new species, G. tamila n. sp, from Sri Lanka. The relationships and biogeography of Anchimacheta and Glaucotunica are discussed.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:19D0038D-051C-4ACC-A7B2-400056F0F9B8
