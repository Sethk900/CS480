Local Adaptation and Effects of Grazing among Seedlings of Two Native California Bunchgrass Species: Implications for Restoration.Adaptation to environmental factors may influence the germination and establishment of focal species in ecological restoration. Reciprocal transplants remain one of the best methods to detect local adaptation, but long-term studies are often not feasible. We conducted reciprocal transplants of the native California bunchgrasses <em>Elymus glaucus </em>and <em>Bromus carinatus </em>between two central California locations to seek evidence of adaptation to local environmental conditions in a single growing season. Experimental plots at one location included grazed and ungrazed sites. The combination of locations and grazing treatments allowed us to determine whether the ability to detect evidence for adaptation depended on grazing regime. In addition, we measured the direct effects of grazing on seedling growth and survival concurrent with our investigation of local adaptation. We detected a homesite advantage for seedling growth or survival in both species, but the factors contributing to adaptive differentiation were species specific. Evidence of local adaptation was detected for seedling biomass in <em>Bromus </em>and for survivorship in <em>Elymus</em>. The homesite advantage observed in both species was greatly reduced under grazed conditions and in <em>Elymus </em>was significant only in the ungrazed plots. Climate and soil analyses detected significant differences between locations in five soil attributes and two climate variables. In particular, differences in exchangeable magnesium indicated that one of the two transplant locations consisted of serpentine soil, which is widely known to drive adaptation in plant populations. Together, these results suggest that it is possible to investigate the scale and factors involved in local adaptation with short-term transplant studies.
