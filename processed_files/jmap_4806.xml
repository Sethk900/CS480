Dicerapanorpa, a new genus of East Asian Panorpidae (Insecta: Mecoptera: Penorpidae) with descriptions of two new speciesDicerapanorpa gen. nov. is erected with Panorpa magna Chou as its type species. The genus is recognizable by the following characters: body yellowish with two blackish lateral longitudinal stripes on dorsum; tergum VI of males with two anal horns; abdominal segment VII of males much thinner at the basal half and abruptly thicker at apical half; parameres of males trifurcate; female genital plate with the axis not extending beyond the main plate. Six new combinations, Dicerapanorpa magna (Chou in Chou et al., 1981), D. diceras (MacLachlan, 1894), D. stotzneri (Esben-Petersen, 1934), D. tjederi (Carpenter, 1938), D. kimminsi (Carpenter, 1948) and D. triclada (Qian and Zhou, 2001) are transferred from Panorpa Linnaeus. Dicerapanorpa baiyunshana sp. nov. and Dicerapanorpa shennongensis sp. nov. are described and illustrated. A key to the genera of Panorpidae is updated to include the new genus. A key to the species of Dicerapanorpa gen. nov. is also presented. http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:F50E44C3-7275-4EC8-B048-4C7B2C6D57EF
