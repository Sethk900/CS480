Clay minerals and potassium status in some soils of JordanThe physical, chemical and mineralogical characteristics of some soils in the Jordan Valley (Rift Valley) and the Highland (Irbid-region) were investigated. The soils of the Highland (Chromoxererts) contained more clay and smectite than those of the Jordan Valley (Camborthids and Torriorthents). Higher contents of carbonates, salts and mica were found in the latter. In addition to smectite and micam interstratified clay minerals (mica/smectite and smectite/chlorite) and kaolinite were present in the clay fractions of the soils in the two regions. Soils of the Highland, especially those under higher rainfall with larger amounts of highly charged smectite, had lower contents of available and total potassium and higher degrees of potassium fixation than those of the Jordan Valley. Soil properties such as carbonate, salt and potassium contents and clay mineral composition were related to the amounts of annual rainfall in soils of the Highland, whereas differences among the Jordan Valley soils were related to the parent materials, especially the underlying Lisan Marl.
