Caracter√≠sticas poblationales y aspectos biol√≥gicos del cirripedio Elminius kingii Gray en el estuario del R√≠o Lingue (Mehu√≠n, Chile)Abstract Population Characteristics and Biological Aspects of the Barnacle Elminius kingii Gray in the Estuary of the R√≠o Lingue (Mehu√≠n, Chile) The population of the barnacle Elminius kingii covers from the intertidal down to the bottom of the Lingue river estuary (Mehu√≠n, Chile). The individuals settle on rocks, stones and shells of Mytilus edulis chilensis. The barnacle covers always more than 70% of the substrate, presenting an average density of 252 individuals dm‚Ä2. The average maximum size decreases with increasing depth. The reproductive period extends from July to March, with a short resting period between April and June. The first sexual maturity is acquired 70 ‚Ä 140 days after settlement, having the individuals an apical rostro carenal length of 5 mm. The life cycle of the species is of eight month. The characteristics of the biology of E. kingii explain the abundance of the species in the estuaries of southern Chile.
