Here we test the hypothesis that habitat fragmentation changes the relative contribution of tree species within categories of reproductive traits (frequency of traits) and reduces the functional diversity of tree assemblages. The study was carried out in an old and severely fragmented landscape of the Brazilian Atlantic forest. We used published information and field observations to obtain the frequency of tree species and individuals within 50 categories of reproductive traits (distributed in four major classes: pollination systems, floral biology, sexual systems, and reproductive systems) in 10 fragments and 10 tracts of forest interior (control plots). As hypothesized, populations in fragments and control plots differed substantially in the representation of the four major classes of reproductive traits (more than 50% of the categories investigated). The most conspicuous differences were the lack of three pollination systems in fragments-pollination by birds, flies and non-flying mammals-and that fragments had a higher frequency of both species and individuals pollinated by generalist vectors. Hermaphroditic species predominate in both habitats, although their relative abundances were higher in fragments. On the contrary, self-incompatible species were underrepresented in fragments. Moreover, fragments showed lower functional diversity (H' scores) for pollination systems (âˆ’30.3%), floral types (âˆ’23.6%), and floral sizes (âˆ’20.8%) in comparison to control plots. In contrast to the overwhelming effect of fragmentation, patch and landscape metrics such as patch size and forest cover played a minor role on the frequency of traits. Our results suggest that habitat fragmentation promotes a marked shift in the relative abundance of tree reproductive traits and greatly reduces the functional diversity of tree assemblages in fragmented landscapes.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Financial support was provided by CAPES (a Master's Thesis scholarship to L.

The Atlantic forest of Brazil is a biodiversity hotspot that has been reduced to less than 8% of its original distribution due to forest clearing and fragmentation that dates to the 16<sup>th</sup> century <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-GalindoLeal1">[32]</xref>.

This scenario offers an excellent opportunity to investigate long-term fragmentation-related changes in tree assemblages and how they influence functional diversity.</p><p>Here we test the hypothesis that the habitat fragmentation changes the frequency of tree species and individuals within categories of reproductive traits and consequently reduces the functional diversity of tree assemblages in a fragmented landscape of the Brazilian Atlantic forest. We begin by comparing the pollination systems, floral biology, sexual systems, and reproductive systems of trees in forest fragments and tracts of forest interior (control plots). We then compare the diversity of these traits in these two habitats based on the relative contribution of both species and individuals. Finally, we discuss potential mechanisms driving the patterns we observed. We conclude that habitat fragmentation promotes a marked shift in the relative abundance of tree reproductive traits, including the lack of some specialized pollination systems and a parallel increase in the frequency of generalist ones. Collectively, shifts in reproductive traits promote a conspicuous reduction in the functional diversity of tree assemblages in fragmented landscapes, which may strongly influence forest dynamics and the persistence of biodiversity.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study site and landscape attributes</title><p>This study was conducted in the State of Alagoas in northeastern Brazil on the property of Usina Serra Grande (8Â°58â€²50â€³S, 36Â°04â€²30â€³W), a large, privately-owned sugar producer.

We calculated these indices twice for each of the 20 plots: first, using categories as the equivalent of species, and the number of tree species within each category as the equivalent of individuals; and second using categories as the equivalent of species and the number of individual within each category.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Differences in (1) the average percentage of species and individuals within each category of reproductive trait, and in (2) the average functional diversity of reproductive traits between the control area and fragments were compared with <italic>t</italic> or Mann-Whitney tests <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Sokal1">[58]</xref>. General linear models (GLM) were used to detect any effect of explanatory variables on the frequency of traits in tree assemblages by first examining the effects of habitat type (fragments <italic>vs.</italic> control plots), soil type and distance to the nearest edge considering all 20 plots in the two habitats, and then the effects of forest fragment size and surrounding forest cover considering the 10 fragments (since these patches and landscape metrics had no variance in Coimbra forest). Normality of all response variables were checked using Lilliefors tests; for GLMs the percentage-expressed dependent variables were arcsine transformed as suggested by Sokal &amp; Rohlf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Sokal1">[58]</xref>.</p><p>Additionally, to examine the effect of habitat and soil type on species similarity between plots these variables were considered as factors in Analysis of Similarities (ANOSIM) tests <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Clarke1">[59]</xref>.

Species abundance were square-root transformed and standardized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Clarke1">[59]</xref> to avoid any bias resulting from very abundant species and differences in the sample size of individuals recorded within each plot. We also performed a Mantel test with Weighted Spearman rank correlations to address the effect of plot geographic location on levels of taxonomic similarity.

The most conspicuous differences concerning species richness within categories of pollination systems can be summarized in four aspects. First, fragments lacked three categories of pollination systemsâ€“pollination by birds, flies and non-flying mammals. Second, scores for hawkmoth- and bat-mediated pollination in fragments were about half of the scores recorded in the control plots. Third, when comparing pollination by vertebrates as whole (birds, bats, and non-flying mammals) fragments had a <italic>ca.</italic> threefold decreased frequency than control plots. Finally, fragments had a 33% increase in the proportion of tree species pollinated by diverse small insects (DSI) in comparison to control plots (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000908-t002">Table 2</xref>). The proportion of tree individuals within categories of pollination systems showed similar trends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000908-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), although for some categories the differences between fragments and control plots were even more dramatic than for species richness (<italic>e.g.</italic> hawkmoth and vertebrate pollination).

Under this approach, fragments showed a prevalence of species with inconspicuous/open type, which was significantly higher than in control sites.

fragmentation promotes marked changes in both the presence and relative abundance of the reproductive traits of tree species, resulting in a reduced functional diversity of tree assemblages in forest

Moreover, small forest patches in severely-fragmented landscapes may be strongly impoverished in terms of the number of species and individuals with particular pollination systems (<italic>e.g.</italic> pollination by bats, birds, non-flying mammals, Sphingids) and may be dominated by tree species pollinated by generalists. Finally, strategies that are more dependent on long-distance pollen movement and animal-mediated services, such as self-incompatibility, may be negatively affected. These statements are supported by the fact that the differences we found between fragments and control plots could not be explained by soil type or the relative spatial position of the plots in the landscape.

Plant assemblages in small fragments (&lt;10 ha) and forest edges are impoverished (scores of alpha diversity reduced by a half) and biased in taxonomic and ecological terms towards pioneer species. These patch-level findings suggest that fragmented landscapes tend to retain just a small subset of species from the original biota. Despite the recent findings on this topic, our study is one of the first to document a marked shift on the signature of tree assemblages inhabiting a fragmented landscape with respect to the frequency of reproductive-related traits and its functional diversity. Similar results were reported by Chazdon <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Chazdon1">[72]</xref> for tree assemblages in second-growth, logged, and old-growth forests in Costa Rica.

In addition, Murcia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Murcia1">[27]</xref> suggested fragmented forests tended to have an increased frequency of self-compatible hermaphrodites at the expense of other sexual systems.

In tropical forests, myriad processes triggered by the creation of forest edges promote a proliferation of short-lived pioneers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Laurance1">[8]</xref> and the local extirpation of shade-tolerant trees, including canopy and understory species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Tabarelli2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Oliveira1">[19]</xref>, emergent trees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Laurance7">[73]</xref> and large-seeded trees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Melo1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Melo2">[34]</xref>.

Some of our findings, such as higher scores of pollination by DSI and flowers with easily accessible resources (inconspicuous+open/dish flowers) in fragments, may simply reflect the dominance of pioneer trees in this habitat as these traits appear to be more frequent among pioneers (65% of the DSI-pollinated species and over 68% of the species with inconspicuous/open/dish flowers are pioneers). On the other hand, a trait such as pollination by bats that was significantly more frequent in control plots (richness and abundance) is also positively associated with a subset of shade-tolerant speciesâ€“75% of the bat-pollinated species are shade-tolerant (<italic>e.g. Bauhinia, Hymenaea-</italic>Fabaceae; <italic>Manilkara-</italic>Sapotaceae; <italic>Quararibea-</italic>Malvaceae <italic>sensu</italic> APG II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-APG1">[75]</xref>). Because the pioneer species recorded in the fragments - including both short- and long-lived pioneers - belong to 16 orders and eight superordinal clades (<italic>sensu</italic> APG II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-APG1">[75]</xref>), the patterns documented here cannot be explained by phylogenetic clustering among pioneers. Even pioneer species that were recorded exclusively in forest fragments belong to four families in four orders and three superordinal clades. Unfortunately, because of the large number of categories for each reproductive trait and the low number of tree species within each category, it was not possible to properly test trait-associated differences between pioneer and shade-tolerant tree species.</p><p>In tropical forests, 98â€“99% of the flowering plant species (and 97.5% of the trees) rely on biotic vectors such as insects and vertebrates for successful pollination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Bawa1">[76]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Bawa2">[77]</xref>, and it has been broadly assumed that plant-pollinator interactions are largely detrimentally affected by habitat loss and fragmentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Rathcke1">[26]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Aguilar1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Ghazoul1">[78]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Renner1">[81]</xref>. Some of the changes we documented in our fragments are therefore expected, particularly the lack or reduced occurrence of some pollination systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Murcia1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Harris1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Hobbs1">[82]</xref>. For instance, fragmented habitats may support less pollinators than continuous habitats due to limited resource availability for pollinators (area-related effects on animal populations). In turn, plants can have a depressed reproductive output as consequence of changes in pollinator diversity, composition, or behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Vamosi1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Harris1">[28]</xref>, <italic>i.e.</italic>, reproductive impairment driven by pollination limitation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Aguilar1">[<italic>sensu</italic> 29]</xref>. Studies on pollinator diversity carried out in our landscape have documented a decreased diversity of nectarivorous bats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-SNeto1">[83]</xref> and hawkmoths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Lopes1">[84]</xref> in small fragments. However, empirical evidence to determine which pollination-related traits and plant-pollinator mutualisms are particularly susceptible to habitat disturbance is still scarce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Harris1">[28]</xref>. Our results suggest that the reduced number of tree species and individuals pollinated by bats and Sphingids in fragments and the absence of fly-, bird-, and non-flying-mammal-pollinated trees, together with the changes in floral traits and sexual systems, may be a higher order effect promoted by habitat fragmentation.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Implications of reduced functional diversity</title><p>The reduced reproductive functional diversity documented in our study landscape's fragments resulted primarily from the lack or skewed representation of some pollination systems, floral types, and floral size categories in terms of both species and individual (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000908-t003">Table 3</xref>). In other words, tree assemblages in this habitat appear to carry a narrower range of floral traits and pollination systems in comparison to patches of forest interior, particularly for pollinators such as mammals and hawkmoths (reduced support capacity). Regardless the underlying mechanism, this narrow range may (1) promote the collapse of pollinator populations; (2) restrict the ecological range of plant and animal groups able to colonize remaining patches of forest or even turn fragments into sink habitats for both plants and their pollinators; and (3) alter the course of natural regeneration or the dynamics of forest fragments toward the establishment of impoverished assemblages in terns of species richness, ecological composition and trophic structure.</p><p>Unfortunately, few studies have addressed shifts on the diversity of plant reproductive traits in human-disturbed habitats, especially those traits associated with plant-pollinator interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Mayfield1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Chazdon1">[72]</xref>. Studies linking these shifts to functional diversity are even more scarce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Mayfield1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Fontaine1">[2]</xref>, despite the fact that pollination processes influence biodiversity maintenance and ecosystem functioning. Fontaine <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Fontaine1">[2]</xref>, for example, argued that even simple structured plant-pollinator communities may have their persistence threatened due to reduced functional diversity, thereby suggesting that functional diversity of pollination networks is critical to avoid biodiversity loss.</p><p>In summary, it is reasonable to propose as a working hypothesis that the persistence of biodiversity and consequently the long-term conservation value of isolated tropical forest fragments may be negatively affected by reduced functional diversity to such an extent yet not anticipated by conservation biologists. Collectively, the proliferation of pioneer species, extirpation of shade-tolerant trees, and reduced functional diversity have the potential to disrupt some trophic interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000908-Wirth1">[<italic>e.g.</italic> 85]</xref>; even landscapes such as ours that were fragmented long ago and are dominated by pioneers may face future biodiversity loss. We believe it would be beneficial for future research to 1) validate and assess the generality of both the patterns and the underlying mechanisms observed here and 2) address more ecosystem level effects driven by reduced functional diversity in fragmented landscapes, such as changes in biodiversity persistence, primary productivity, nutrient cycling, succession, and ecosystem resilience.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0000908.s001" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000908.s001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Species studied and their abundance in forest fragments (Nâ€Š=â€Š10) and control plots (Nâ€Š=â€Š10) in a fragmented landscape of Atlantic forest, northeastern Brazil.</p><p>(0.55 MB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are very grateful to Alexandre Grillo and Marcondes Oliveira (UFPE-Brazil) for their immeasurable cooperation and for permitting us to use data from their botanical surveys; LuÃ­s AntÃ´nio Bezerra and Clodoaldo Bakker for permitting this research on the private property of the Usina Serra Grande; Carlos Peres (University of East Anglia-England) for discussions and help with analyses; AndrÃ© Santos (UFPE-Brazil) and AntÃ´nio Aguiar-Neto (UF-USA) for discussions and help in several phases of this study; JÃ©rÃ´me Chave (Academic Editor) and an anonymous reviewer for valuable suggestions on the manuscript.
