Mediterranean native shrubs can be very useful for green roofs in hot and arid regions. Our data show that both  Arbutus unedo  L. and  Salvia officinalis  L. could be successfully utilized, although the choice of species should be based on the drought-resistant strategy relative to the desired technical performance of the green roof. Moreover, substrate selection was found to have a crucial role in the success of green roof installations in the Mediterranean area.  Recent studies have highlighted the ecological, economic and social benefits assured by green roof technology to urban areas. However, green roofs are very hostile environments for plant growth because of shallow substrate depths, high temperatures and irradiance and wind exposure. This study provides experimental evidence for the importance of accurate selection of plant species and substrates for implementing green roofs in hot and arid regions, like the Mediterranean area. Experiments were performed on two shrub species ( Arbutus unedo  L. and  Salvia officinalis  L.) grown in green roof experimental modules with two substrates slightly differing in their water retention properties, as derived from moisture release curves. Physiological measurements were performed on both well-watered and drought-stressed plants. Gas exchange, leaf and xylem water potential and also plant hydraulic conductance were measured at different time intervals following the last irrigation. The substrate type significantly affected water status.  Arbutus unedo  and  S. officinalis  showed different hydraulic responses to drought stress, with the former species being substantially isohydric and the latter one anisohydric. Both  A. unedo  and  S. officinalis  were found to be suitable species for green roofs in the Mediterranean area. However, our data suggest that appropriate choice of substrate is key to the success of green roof installations in arid environments, especially if anisohydric species are employed.  Green roofs are engineered ecosystems designed to favour plant establishment on manufactured layers installed over rooftops, and typically comprise lightweight mineral substrate, drainage and moisture retention layers and a root-resistant waterproofing barrier ( VanWoert  et al . 2005 ;  Berndtsson 2010 ). Modern green roofs were first developed in the 1960s in Germany and, over the last 15 years, this technology has received increasing attention in several countries of Northern and Central Europe, North America, Australia, Japan and China ( Bowler  et al . 2010 ;  Dvorak and Volder 2010 ;  Williams  et al . 2010 ;  Chen 2013 ). This renewed interest for green roofs is a consequence of recent experimental evidence highlighting the ecological, economic and social benefits provided by this technology to urban areas. In fact, green roofs have been reported to improve urban management of water runoff (e.g.  Getter  et al . 2007 ;  Lundholm  et al . 2010 ;  MacIvor and Lundholm 2011 ;  Nardini  et al . 2012 a  ), reduce the consumption of energy for thermal comfort of buildings (e.g.  Theodosiou 2003 ;  Sailor  et al . 2008 ;  Blanusa  et al . 2013 ), mitigate the ‘urban heat island’ effect ( Gill  et al . 2007 ;  Takebayashi and Moriyama 2007 ;  Mackey  et al . 2012 ), improve acoustic insulation ( Van Renterghem and Botteldooren 2008 ,  2009 ), improve air ( Rowe 2011 ) and water quality ( Carter and Jackson 2007 ;  Berndtsson 2010 ) and sequester CO 2  ( Getter  et al . 2009 ;  Li  et al . 2010 ). Moreover, this technology could prove useful for recycling of waste materials ( Solano  et al . 2012 ;  Mickovski  et al . 2013 ) and might provide effective instruments to ameliorate the urban appeal, increase the number of recreational spaces and improve urban biodiversity ( Brenneisen 2006 ;  MacIvor and Lundholm 2011 ).  Green roofs are rather hostile environments for plant growth, because of shallow substrate, high temperatures and irradiance and wind exposure ( Getter and Rowe 2008 ;  Liu  et al . 2012 ). In particular, structural features of buildings frequently require the use of reduced substrate depths, with predictable impacts on water availability to vegetation. This, in turn, limits the number of species that can thrive over green roofs, especially in hot and arid regions like Mediterranean countries ( Fioretti  et al . 2010 ;  Nardini  et al . 2012 b  ), where drought, high irradiance and temperatures are common stress factors even for natural vegetation ( Sánchez-Gómez  et al . 2006 ;  David  et al . 2007 ;  Nardini  et al . 2014 ). Under these environmental conditions, the plants' growth over green roofs is particularly challenging and thus requires specific technological and ecophysiological strategies to improve plant survival ( Dvorak and Volder 2013 ).  In particular, the selection of substrates with high water holding capacity and high amounts of water available to plants is apparently a key requirement to improve the performance of green roofs in arid climates. As an example,  Farrell  et al . (2012)  reported a correlation between the survival rate of different succulent species under drought stress and the water holding capacity of different substrates. Similarly,  Razzaghmanesh  et al . (2014)  reported significant effects of substrate type on growth and survival of different grass species native to the Australian flora. Moreover, improving water holding capacity of the substrate, amended with different materials, has been reported to be effective in increasing plant survival rates and ameliorating plant water status under drought conditions ( Farrell  et al . 2013 ;  Papafotiou  et al . 2013 ;  Savi  et al . 2014 ).  The selection of drought-resistant plant species is as important as substrate features in order to assure the success of green roofs in arid environments. Specific studies addressing the relative suitability of different plant species for green roof development have appeared in recent years ( Dvorak and Volder 2010 ;  MacIvor and Lundholm 2011 ;  Cook-Patton and Bauerle 2012 ;  Papafotiou  et al . 2013 ;  Van Mechelen  et al . 2014 ), but the most commonly used species are still small succulents, mainly belonging to the genus  Sedum  ( Snodgrass and Snodgrass 2006 ;  Oberndorfer  et al . 2007 ;  Rowe  et al . 2012 ). These are characterized by shallow roots, high drought tolerance and relatively fast propagation ( Snodgrass and Snodgrass 2006 ;  Getter and Rowe 2009 ;  Farrell  et al . 2012 ). In contrast, only few studies have explored the possibility to use alternative plant species over green roofs in arid regions, despite the high number (and drought adaptation) of species native to the Mediterranean region ( Benvenuti and Bacci 2010 ;  Papafotiou  et al . 2013 ;  Benvenuti 2014 ;  Van Mechelen  et al . 2014 ). In particular, the impressive heterogeneity in plant hydraulic strategies and water relations displayed by Mediterranean plants ( Nardini  et al . 2014 ;  Vilagrosa  et al . 2014 ) might represent an important resource for designing green roofs with specifically requested technical features. As an example, isohydric species that display tight stomatal control of transpiration might help to design green roofs with high resistance against drought, as well as with low irrigation requirements ( Rowe  et al . 2014 ). On the other hand, anisohydric species that maximize transpiration and photosynthesis while tolerating very negative water potential values might represent a more interesting choice in order to favour transpirational cooling of buildings ( Schweitzer and Erell 2014 ) and/or improve the capacity of green roofs to intercept water during intense albeit sporadic rainfall events ( Nardini  et al . 2012 a  ).  In the present study, we provide experimental evidence for the importance of substrate characteristics, with special reference to water retention properties, to assure sufficient water availability to plants over green roofs under drought stress conditions. Moreover, we provide insights into the importance of species-specific drought-resistance strategies and hydraulic properties for selecting Mediterranean native species best suited for specific technical functions and ecological requirements of green roofs. To this aim, experiments were performed using two Mediterranean shrub species:  Arbutus unedo  L. and  Salvia officinalis  L.  Salvia officinalis  (sage) is a perennial, evergreen, sub-shrub species widely naturalized even outside its original habitat.  Arbutus unedo  (arbutus) is an evergreen shrub or small tree widely distributed in the Mediterranean Basin ( Pignatti 2002 ). Both species are well known for their drought tolerance, although a specific comparison of their hydraulic strategies has not been previously performed.  Experiments were performed between May and July 2012 on 36 plants of  A. unedo  and 36 plants of  S. officinalis . Plants were provided at the end of April 2012 by a local nursery and planted in 24 experimental green roof modules with dimensions 75 × 23 × 27 cm (i.e. 12 modules per species, 3 plants per module  [see  Supporting Information ] ). The modules were assembled with the SEIC ®  extensive system (Harpo Spa, Trieste, Italy). The layering included a water retention geotextile (MediPro MP), a drainage and aeration element (MediDrain MD), a filtering layer (MediFilter MF 1) and 18 cm of one of the two different experimental substrates provided by SEIC. Species-specific modules were divided into two main categories on the basis of substrate type tested: substrate A and substrate B. In summary, six modules per species contained substrate A and six modules were filled with substrate B  [ see Supporting Information ] .  Percentage of different grain sizes, organic matter, porosity and values of electrical conductivity and pH of the two substrate types utilized (i.e. A and B). Data are kindly provided by SEIC.  The water retention properties of the two substrates were preliminarily measured using a dewpoint potentiameter (WP4, Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA, USA). In particular, the relationships between water content (WC) and water potential (pressure–volume curve) of the two substrates were measured to estimate the amount of water available to plants ( Whalley  et al . 2013 ). Samples of the two substrates were watered to saturation. After complete drainage of excess water, small samples (a few grams each) were collected and placed in dedicated WP4 sample-holders. Water potential of substrate (Ψ s ) was measured in the continuous mode and after each reading, samples were weighed with an electronic balance (Basic BA110S, Sar-torius AG, Göttingen, Germany) to obtain their fresh weight (FW), and then oven-dried at 70 °C for 24 h. Samples were weighed again to get their dry weight (DW). Water content of samples was calculated as (FW − DW)/DW. Measurements were performed on fully hydrated samples as well as on samples air-dehydrated for increasing time intervals.  Green roof modules were randomly located over the flat rooftop of the Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of Messina. On the basis of irrigation regime, experimental modules were further divided in four experimental groups per species  [ see Supporting Information ] : three modules per substrate type category were regularly watered to field capacity (well-watered plants: WA and WB), while the other three modules per substrate-type category received irrigation up to 75 % field capacity (stressed plants: SA and SB). Irrigation was supplied at 48 h intervals for 10 weeks. At the end of the treatment, all plants were irrigated to field capacity and physiological measurements were performed again 24 and 48 h after irrigation.  During the study period, mean air temperatures and relative humidity in the area were 19 ± 1 °C and 74 ± 7 % in May, 24 ± 2 °C and 75 ± 5 % in June and 28 ± 1 °C and 74 ± 5 % in July, respectively. The total rainfall was 13 mm only. Climatic data were obtained from the weather station of Torre Faro, Messina, Italy.  At the beginning and at the end of the experiment (i.e. beginning of May and end of July, respectively), two plants within each module of  S. officinalis  and two plants within each module of  A. unedo  per each experimental group (i.e. WA, SA, WB and SB) were selected and the following parameters were measured: plant height (H), trunk diameter at the root-stem transition zone (Ø) and total number of leaves per plant ( N  leaves/plant). During the study period, substrate water status (Ψ s ) of both W and S-modules was estimated by measuring the pre-dawn water potential (Ψ pd ) of six leaves wrapped in cling-film the day before measurements (two leaves per species and per module) and sampled at 0500 hours (solar time). Measurements were performed with a pressure chamber (3005 Plant Water Status Console, Soilmoisture Equipment Corp., Goleta, CA, USA), assuming that under nocturnal low transpiration conditions leaf water potential equilibrated with Ψ s , so that Ψ pd  ∼ Ψ s  ( Richter 1997 ;  Nardini  et al . 2003 ). The indirect estimation of Ψ s  was preferred to direct sampling of the substrate, in order to avoid the risk of damage to the root system. Measurements of Ψ pd  were performed on the same days selected for gas exchange and midday leaf water potential measurements (see below).  At the end of the 10-week treatment period, both 24 and 48 h after irrigation, maximum leaf stomatal conductance to water vapour ( g  L ) and transpiration rate ( E  L ) were measured between 1200 and 1400 hours on leaves of at least one plant per module per experimental group and species using a steady-state porometer (LI-1600, LICor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). At the same time, midday diurnal leaf water potential (Ψ midday ) was estimated using a portable pressure chamber (3005 Plant Water Status Console, Soilmoisture Equipment Corp.).  In order to quantify eventual acclimation of water relation parameters in terms of leaf water potential at the turgor loss point (Ψ tlp ), osmotic potential at full turgor ( π  0 ) and bulk modulus of elasticity ( ɛ  max ), leaf water potential isotherms of leaves of at least one plant per module per experimental group were determined from pressure–volume (P–V) curves ( Tyree and Hammel 1972 ). Measurements were performed before starting the treatment and repeated at the end of the 10-week period, respectively.  Whole-plant hydraulic conductance ( K  plant ) was estimated  in planta  using the Evaporative Flux Method on at least one plant per module per species and per experimental group ( Nardini  et al . 2003 ).  K  plant  was calculated as:  E  L /(Ψ midday  − Ψ s ), where  E  L , Ψ midday  and Ψ s  were measured as described above. All hydraulic conductance values were corrected to a temperature of 20 °C, to take into account changes in water viscosity.  Data were analysed with the SigmaStat 2.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) statistics package. To test the differences among substrate type and the effects of both irrigation regimes and time after last irrigation on Ψ s ,  g  L  and  K  plant , a three-way ANOVA was performed (soil, irrigation and time as factors) with Type III sums of squares. The same test was used to check the significance of the differences among substrate type and the effects of irrigation regime and time (i.e. May and July) on H, Ø and N leaves/plant. To test the differences among substrate type and effects of irrigation regime on Ψ tlp ,  π  o  and  ɛ  max  a two-way ANOVA test was performed. Data have been analysed by nesting the plant observations within each module ( n  = 3).  When the difference was significant, a post hoc Tukey's test was carried out. Relationships between the studied characteristics and independent variables were assessed by Pearson's correlations.  Means ± SD ( n  = 3) of plant height (H), trunk diameter (Ø) and number of leaves per plant ( N  leaves/plant) as recorded in May and in July (i.e. at the beginning and at the end of treatment irrigation regimes) in plants of  S. officinalis  and  A. unedo  growing in two types of substrate (A and B) and irrigation regimes (W: plants irrigated to field capacity; S: plants irrigated to 75 % field capacity) (for details, see text).

Our data suggest that the use of species selected from the native flora of the Mediterranean region might be a valuable strategy for implementation of green roof systems in hot and arid areas. On the other hand, our findings reveal that even subtle differences in terms of substrate properties, with special reference to water relation parameters, can have very important consequences for the performance and persistence of vegetation over green roofs.  Substrate A was more suitable than substrate B for installation of efficient and fully functional green roofs in arid-prone areas. This was mainly due to the higher water retention capability related to the particle size, and especially to the higher amounts of water potentially available to plants (Fig.  1 ). This feature resulted in the maintenance of higher soil water potential values over 48 h after the last irrigation in plants growing in modules containing substrate A than in samples growing in modules filled with substrate B, as observed in both species, despite their different water relations strategies (Figs  2  and  3 ).  Arbutus and sage plants apparently adopted contrasting strategies to cope with drought stress. On the basis of relationships between  g  L  and leaf water potential, it can be suggested that  A. unedo  adopted a rather typical isohydric behaviour, while  S. officinalis  displayed a significant level of anisohydry, although a recent study has highlighted the fact that there might be a continuum of water relations strategies along these two ideal extremes ( Klein 2014 ). Values of  g  L  were lower in arbutus than in sage, even in well-watered samples (∼130 versus 300 mmol m −2  s −1 , respectively, Fig.  3 A and B), and a further reduction of stomatal conductance was observed in arbutus plants under water stress (∼70 mmol m −2  s −1 ). Progressive stomatal closure apparently allowed arbutus plants to limit water loss and maintain relatively stable leaf water potential values both under well-watered and drought stress conditions, especially in samples growing in modules filled with substrate type A (Figs  3 D and  5 B). In contrast,  S. officinalis  plants maintained values of  g  L  as high as ∼300 mmol m −2  s −1  as long as soil water potential remained above a critical value of about −0.6 MPa (Figs  3 C and  5 A). Below this threshold, gas exchange rates were reduced by ∼50 % (from 300 to 150 mmol m −2  s −1 , as recorded in SB samples 48 h after last irrigation Fig.  3 A). This, in turn, induced statistically significant differences in leaf water potential values as a function of the time after the last irrigation, regime of irrigation and the type of substrate (Fig.  3 C, Table  4 ). The different water use strategies adopted by arbutus and sage plants to face drought stress were also confirmed by the analysis of leaf water potential isotherms. In fact, water-stressed plants of  S. officinalis  lowered the leaf water potential at the turgor loss point by osmotic adjustment. In the case of arbutus, water stress induced a significant increase of the bulk modulus of elasticity ( ɛ  max , Tables  3  and  4 ).  Isohydric and anisohydric behaviour of different species/genotypes could arise from different stomatal sensitivity to xylem-born ABA ( Tardieu and Simonneau 1998 ;  Beis and Patakas 2010 ;  Gallè  et al . 2013 ) and/or to different levels of xylem hydraulic safety/efficiency ( Schultz 2003 ;  Tombesi  et al . 2014 ). Different levels of stomatal control of transpiration under drought stress are known to affect photosynthetic productivity and plant growth ( Medrano  et al . 2002 ;  Xu and Zhou 2008 ). In the present study, the anisohydric behaviour recorded in sage plants was coupled to a strong reduction of the number of leaves per plant as recorded in July in stressed versus watered samples (i.e. ∼100 % versus ∼40 %). Isohydric and anisohydric behaviours of the two study species were further supported by estimates of plant hydraulic conductance (Fig.  5 ). In fact, arbutus plants (isohydric) showed three times lower  K  plant  than sage plants (anisohydric, Fig.  4 ), and this parameter remained quite constant up to 48 h after the last irrigation in samples growing in modules filled with substrate B, despite wide variations in terms of soil water availability (Figs  2 B,  4 B and  5 B). In contrast,  K  plant  of  S. officinalis  strongly changed as a function of Ψ s  (Figs  4 A and  5 A). In other words, the isohydric behaviour of arbutus allowed to maintain stable  K  plant  values, while anisohydry in sage implied a drop of  K  plant  as drought progressed.  Data recorded in the present study suggest that arbutus plants could overcome intense drought conditions and, then, might be more suitable for Mediterranean green roofs than to sage plants. In fact, the higher water use of the latter species might imply the need of additional irrigation to prevent foliage damage and/or desiccation under prolonged drought. In the literature,  A. unedo  is frequently reported to be able to survive even severe drought stress (i.e.  Castell and Terradas 1995 ;  Gratani and Ghia 2002 ;  Munné-Bosch and Peñuelas 2004 ), as it apparently maintains a positive carbon balance until pre-dawn leaf water potential values of −4 MPa ( Filella and Peñuelas 2003 ). In contrast, sage plants are known to show leaf senescence symptoms when exposed to severe drought conditions (i.e. Ψ pd  &lt; −1 MPa,  Munné-Bosch  et al . 2001 ;  Abreu and Munné-Bosch 2008 ;  Savi  et al . 2013 ). Hence, while arbutus might represent a suitable species for green roofs with very low input of additional irrigation, sage might be more recommendable in order to maximize the transpirational cooling of buildings and/or to favour fast water depletion from substrates, thus improving the effectiveness of green roofs to mitigate water runoff during occasional storms, although the use of this species would probably be possible only when regular albeit low irrigation inputs are guaranteed ( Savi  et al . 2013 ). Additional studies focussed on testing the physiological performance and water requirements of a large number of Mediterranean species over green roofs are required to conclude about possible relationships between plant hydraulic strategies and green roof performance under drought.

The following additional information is available in the online version of this article –   Figure S1.  Schematic representation of the experimental design. Twenty-four modules (75 × 23 × 27 cm) were divided in two groups of 12 modules in which 36 plants of  A. unedo  and 36 plants of  S. officinalis  were planted, respectively (i.e. 3 plants per module). Two types of substrate (A and B) and two irrigation regimes (well watered, W and stressed, S) were tested. More in detail, 12 modules per species were divided in two categories on the basis of substrate type tested: 6 modules per species contained substrate A and the other 6 modules contained substrate B. These modules were further divided in four experimental groups on the basis of irrigation regime: 3 modules per substrate type category were regularly watered to field capacity (i.e. WA and WB modules), and 3 modules per substrate type category received irrigation up to 75 % field capacity (i.e. SA and SB modules).
