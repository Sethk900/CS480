K., 1981. The effect of temperature on the selectivity of EDTA as an  extractant for amorphous iron oxides, Geoderma, 26: 121--124.  Two soil samples, one from Denmark and the other from Tanzania, were extracted with  EDTA at temperatures of 40 or 90 and various pH values for periods up to a maximum  of 50 days. The amounts of iron removed were then compared with those extracted by a  ,,standard" method, which consisted of treatment with an alkaline solution of EDTA at 21  (room temperature) f,~r periods ranging from 3 to 9 months. The amounts extracted at the  higher temperatures and also at lower pH values were compared to those from the ,,standard"  method. Amounts removed at 90 were appreciably higher than the ,,standard" for both  samples, indicating attack on crystalline forms of iron oxides and other soil minerals. Simi-  lar attacks apparently occurred for the sample from Tanzania at 40. Extraction of the sam-  ple from Denmark at 40C and at pH values above 8.8 removed the same amounts of iron  as did the ,,standard" method. Even so, the experimental results suggest that the possibility  of shortening extraction times by the use of higher temperatures is not feasible.    INTRODUCTION  A procedure developed for the selective extraction of amorphous iron oxides  from soil samples requires several months, which is too long for routine analy-  ses. The procedure, which will be called the ,,standard" method in this paper,  consists of extraction of a soil sample with a weakly alkaline solution of EDTA  (ethylenediamine-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid) at 21 for periods ranging from  3 to 9 months (Borggaard, 1979, 1981). If that time period could be shortened  appreciably,-the procedure would promise to be more widely useful. It seemed  possible that extraction time might be reduced if higher temperatures were  used. Consequently, extractions of samples were conducted at temperatures  of 40C and 90C and at several pH values. Results of those experiments are  reportod in this note.    0016-7061/81/0000--0000/$02.50 1981 Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company    122    MATERIALS AND METHODS    Soils    Two soil samples were used in the experiments, one from Denmark and the  other from Tanzania. The first sample came from the surface layer of sandy  loam of a Eutric Cambisol at Hem in Jutland, Denmark; it was also used in de-  velopment of the ,,standard" method (Borggaard, 1979). The second sample  was of clay texture from the deeper part (60--90 cm) of a profile of a Ferric  Acrisol in the West Lake region of Tanzania (Merg, 1972; Borggaard, 1981).  In this paper, the first one is called the Hem sample and the second one the Bull  2A sample.    Methods    The preparation of the EDTA solutions and the extraction procedure have  been described previously (Borggaard, 1979). In the latest experiments, the  solutions were at several different pH values and extractions were made at  higher temperatures than those of the ,,standard". The extractions were carried  out in plastic bottles in a thermostatically controlled water bath with continual  shaking. At the end of the extraction period the bottles were centrifuged at  3000 g for 20 min and the supernatant filtered. Amounts of extracted iron  were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.    RESULTS    The amounts of iron removed from the two samples are shown in the two  graphs in Fig. 1 as functions of extraction time. Within the graphs are given the  soil: solution ratios, the pH values of the solutions, and the temperatures. For  comparison, the amounts of iron extracted by the ,,standard" method are shown  as straight lines in the two graphs.  Selective extraction of iron oxides in amorphous form is considered to have  been achieved if two conditions are met. First, amounts of iron removed be-  come stable and do not increase significantly (95% level) after some extraction  time. Second, the amounts extracted within that time do not exceed those  removed by the ,,standard" method.  A temperature of 90 is clearly too high for extraction of amorphous iron  oxides only. For both samples, the removal of iron continued at that temper-  ature for the full time interval of the longest extractions. For sample BuII 2A  from Tanzania, results of the extraction at pH 4.9 and 90 agree with those  of Torrent et al. {1980) who found that ~he amounts removed by EDTA at  pH 4.7 5 and 90 became '.arger with increasing extraction time in an almost  linear fashion.  A temperature of 40 showed limited promise; it did allow shorter extrac-  tion times for one sample but did not work for the other.

Amounts of iron extracted from the two soil samples by various EDTA solutions  at 40 and 90 plotted against the extraction time, ionic strength 1.0 (NH, Ac). The  straight lines indicate iron extracted by the ,,standard" method, i.e. treatment of the  samples with alkaline EDTA solutions at 21 for periods ranging from 3 to 9 months.    removed in 14 days from the Hem sample (Denmark) at 40 and pH 8.8  was the same as that removed by the ,,standard" method. Furthermore, extrac-  tions at pH 10.3 could be made at temperatures up to 50 with the same re-  subs. In contrast, a temperature of 40 was too high for sample BuII 2A from  Tanzania. The amounts of iron removed increased with increased extraction  times and did not stabilize in periods up to 50 days.  The pH as well as the temperature greatly affects the amounts of iron extrac-  ted from the samples in a given period of time. This was found true when the  procedure was initially developed (Borggaard, 1979). The amounts of iron re-  moved at 21 during periods ranging from 3 to 9 months were directly re-  lated to pH below a value of 7.5. Above that value, however, pH no longer af-  fected the amounts of iron removed in the extractions. The data plotted in  Fig. 1 show that selective extractions of amorphous iron oxides from the Hem  sample can be achieved above a temperature of 21 if pH of the EDTA solu-  tion is kept relatively high, e.g. pH &gt; ~ 8.8, if the extraction temperature is  40C and pH 10.3 at 50C. Higher temperature increases the susceptibility of    124    the crystalli;  ,~oil minerals to attack by EDTA, whereas an elevation of pH  has the opposite effect.  The differing results obtained with the two soil samples are believed due to  differences in the nature of component minerals and their susceptibility to at-  tack by EDTA. Chief minerals in the Hem sample from Denmark are 2:1 and  1:1 layer sfli.'cates, amphiboles, quartz, and feldspars, whereas those in sample  BuII 2A from ~I anzania are kaolinite, goethite, hematite, and the like. No at-  tack of crystalline minerals seems to occur in treatment of the Hem sample at  pH 9--10 and 40C. This inference is based on the amount of magnesium ex-  tracted. The amount equaled exchangeable magnesium and was independent  of the extraction time. By way of contrast, some of the crystalline minerals in  sample BuII 2A were apparently attacked at pH 9.9 and 40C. Such attack is  inferred from the continued removal of iron as the time interval of treatment  was increased. The susceptibility of the Tanzanian sample to attack is ascribed  to poor crystall,:nity of iron oxide minerals. Torrent et al. {1980) reported pref-  erential dissolution by EDTA of poorly crystalline hematite at pH 4.75 and  90C. Similar attacks on both hematite and goethite are believed to have oc-  curred in extractions of the sample from Tanzania.  CONCLUSIONS  Extractions ~vith EDTA at higher temperatures to shorten the time required  for selective removal of amorphous iron oyides do not seem feasible generally.  The results with t.~,e soil sample from Dem~ark suggest that a temperature of  40 might work for some soils. On the other hand, results with the sample  from Tanzania demonstra'!;e that temperatures higher than that of the ,,stan-  dard" method (21) were not suitable for other soil samples. The possibility  of reducing the time required for selective extraction of amorphous iron ox-  ides by EDTA thus seem doubtful at best.  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  My thanks are due to Dr. J. P.

AbstractTwo soil samples, one from Denmark and the other from Tanzania, were extracted with EDTA at temperature of 40Ã‚Â°C or 90Ã‚Â°C and various pH values for periods up to a maximum of 50 days. The amounts of iron removed were then compared with those extracted by a Ã¢Â€ÂœstandardÃ¢Â€Â method, which consisted of treatment with an alkaline solution of EDTA at 21Ã‚Â°C (room temperature) for periods ranging from 3 to 9 months. The amounts extracted at the higher temperatures and also at lower pH values were compared to those from the Ã¢Â€ÂœstandardÃ¢Â€Â method. Amounts removed at 90Ã‚Â°C were appreciably higher than the Ã¢Â€ÂœstandardÃ¢Â€Â for both samples, indicating attack on crystalline forms of iron oxides and other soil minerals. Similar attacks apparently occurred for the sample from Tanzania at 40Ã‚Â°C. Extraction of the sample from Denmark at 40Ã‚Â°C and pH values above 8.8 removed the same amounts of iron as did the Ã¢Â€ÂœstandardÃ¢Â€Â method. Even so, the experimental results suggest that the possibility of shortening extraction times by the use of higher temperatures is not feasible.
