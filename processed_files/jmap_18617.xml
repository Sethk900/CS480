ON THE EFFECTS OF SOIL FERTILITY ON THE RATE OF SOIL RESPIRATION IN A FORESTThe effects of soil fertility on the rate of soil respiration was studied in three Chamaecyparis obtusa stands differing in soil conditions on Mt. Hiei, Shiga Prefecture [Japan]. The rate of soil respiration increased exponentially with the increase of temperature. The estimated value of Q10 was about 2 for three stands. The annualr ats of soil respiration ranged from 4.54 to 6.40 (C .cntdot. t .cntdot. ha-1 .cntdot. yr-1) for three plots studied which were small compared with the rates reported in southern Japan. P-1 was located on lower-slope, where the soil is classified into BD and the fertility is higher than the soil (tye BB) of P-4 located on upper-slope. The accumulated amount of carbon and the rate of litterfall were high in P-1 and low in P-4. However, the rate of soil respiration was higher in P-4 than in P-1. The soil samples collected from P-1 and P-4 were incubated in 27.degree. C incubator. The rate of CO2 evolution was higher for soils of P-4 than of P-1. These results indicate the rate of soil respiration changes depending on the soil type or soil fertility.
