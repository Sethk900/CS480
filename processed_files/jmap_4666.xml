Release of Rambo, a new groundnut cultivarThe groundnut industry in South Africa has, for some time, been in need of a large kernel cultivar for both the kernel and pod confectionary market. The only available cultivars until now were Billy, a cultivar with a variegated testa, and Selmani, a runner type cultivar. Both these cultivars were unacceptable to the industry. The new cultivar, Rambo, will address the market demand for a large kernel cultivar, and compares well to the existing two cultivars with regard to kernel size and yield potential.
