Wrote the paper: ZD.Plant C storage ranged from 258.6 to 295.2 g C m<sup>−2</sup>, and soil C storage ranged from 2086.9 to 2752.5 g C m<sup>−2</sup> for the three treatments as measured in July, 2011. Plant N storage ranged from 5.8 to 7.0 g N m<sup>−2</sup>, and soil N storage ranged from 199.8 to 223.0 g N m<sup>−2</sup> for the three treatments as measured in July, 2011. No difference in C and N storage was found among the three treatments in July, 2011 (data were not presented).The authors gratefully acknowledge the help of Dr Cheng Xiaoli in providing valuable revisions of the manuscript.
