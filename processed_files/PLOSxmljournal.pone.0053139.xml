Kowalczyk TS.The European Alps harbour a unique and species-rich biodiversity, which is increasingly impacted by habitat fragmentation through land-use changes, urbanization and expanding transport infrastructure. In this study, we identified the 50 most important questions relating to the maintenance and restoration of an ecological continuum â€“ the connectedness of ecological processes across many scales including trophic relationship and disturbance processes and hydro-ecological flows in the European Alps. We initiated and implemented a trans-national priority setting exercise, inviting 48 institutions including researchers, conservation practitioners, NGOs, policymakers and administrators from the Alpine region. The exercise was composed of an initial call for pertinent questions, a first online evaluation of the received questions and a final discussion and selection process during a joint workshop. The participating institutions generated 484 initial questions, which were condensed to the 50 most important questions by 16 workshop participants. We suggest new approaches in tackling the issue of an ecological continuum in the Alps by analysing and classifying the characteristics of the resulting questions in a non-prioritized form as well as in a visual conceptualisation of the inter-dependencies among these questions. This priority setting exercise will support research and funding institutions in channelling their capacities and resources towards questions that need to be urgently addressed in order to facilitate significant progress in biodiversity conservation in the European Alps.In this study, we identified the 50 most important questions relating to the maintenance and restoration of an ecological continuum in the European Alps. We initiated and implemented a trans-national priority setting exercise, inviting researchers, practitioners, NGOs, policy makers and other stakeholders from the Alpine region to participate. The exercise was composed of an initial call for pertinent questions, a first online evaluation of the received questions and a final discussion and selection process during a joint workshop. Furthermore, we suggest new approaches in tackling the issue of an ecological continuum in the Alps by analysing and classifying the characteristics of the resulting questions in a non-prioritized form as well as a visual conceptualisation of the inter-dependencies among these questions.The largest proportion of questions (46%) was attributed to the nature context. The nature context questions are rather evenly distributed between the three subtopics. This is followed by the management context (44%) where by far the largest proportion of questions relates to the legislation, policy and planning needs subtopic (63%). Finally the people context makes up a mere 10% of the total questions. From the 50 questions, by far the largest fraction (60%) was formulated as â€œhowâ€ questions, followed by â€œwhatâ€ (26%) and â€œwhichâ€ questions (14%). Consequently, most attention was given to transformation processes aiming at practices to improve the current situation in Alpine connectivity.The nine sub-topics of the three context areas (nature: green; people: red; management: blue) mark the edges of the web. The questions of each context area are interlinked and marked in the same colour as the sub-topics they were assigned to. Questions (numbers; see text) which also address another context area are further linked with a second sub-topic, highlighting the interactions. Bold arrows indicate that one or more questions need to be solved before a subsequent question can be answered.Overall, 27 questions were assigned to a second context area due to their transdisciplinary nature. The sub-topics 6 â€œeconomic, social and political needsâ€ (PC) and 9 â€œtools, incentives, knowledgeâ€ (MC) showed the most inter-relations to other context areas (8 and 7 links, respectively).Similarly question 15 â€œWhat is an effective set of indicators (for species and habitats) that can be used to evaluate and monitor connectivity at different scales?â€ is a prerequisite in addressing 3 other questions: namely question 2 â€œHow are corridors best implemented; with clearly spatially defined borders or as functional units integrated in wide ecological continuums?â€, question 19 â€œAre artificially engineered ecological networks a threat or benefit to endemic species?â€ and question 46 â€œWhat methods can be used to record the effectiveness of functional connectivity, or its elements, across different spatial and temporal scales?â€. Essential questions like question 15, dealing with indicators and methodological approaches, should be given clear priority, as their answer is a precondition for scientifically sound answers to other, subsequent questions.including core team.Initiation. Based on the individual networks of the core team and striving to depict a representative cross-section of the main players in Alpine biodiversity conservation, we invited 48 institutions including researchers, conservation practitioners, NGOs, policymakers and administrators from the Alpine area to participate in this initiative.Pre-workshop voting. In order to reduce the set of questions, we distributed the initial-questions-list to all participants for a first evaluation. Rephrasing and adding of questions was actively encouraged at this stage. In preparation for the workshop phase, participants were then asked to select a maximum of 55 questions from the total of 484 questions submitted. Participants were also asked to only select questions from areas in which they had sufficient knowledge base. A total of 385 questions received at least one vote and an additional 15 questions were proposed at this stage.Workshop. Final discussion and voting took place during a two-day workshop in December 2010 in Switzerland. Unfortunately, only 16 participants were able to attend. The remaining 400 questions assigned to the twelve topic areas (median: 33; range: 24â€“46/topic area) were discussed in four sessions. In each session, three groups worked simultaneously to reduce and rephrase the questions. In the plenary session the participants decided to reduce the questions to 50 instead of 55 due to overlaps. The final 50 questions were selected in a plenary session by majority vote following discussion.Every context area consists of three different sub-topics which interact with each other.All questions were formulated either as (i) what - asking for information about something, (ii) which - asking about choice and (iii) how â€“ questioning manner, condition or quality in order to further breakdown and classify the outcomes.The authors thank the following persons for the submission of questions and comments: Michaela Kuenzl and Anne-Katrin Heinrichs (Nationalpark Berchtesgaden, Germany); Kerstin Lehmann (Bundesamt fÃ¼r Naturschutz, Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, Germany); Kathrin Renner (European Academy of Bozen - EURAC); Daniela Pauli and Marc Gessner (Swiss Biodiversity Forum); Janine Bolliger (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology/Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL); Christina Kubalek and Natalia Razumovsky (WWF Austria); Gabor von Bethlenfalvy (Federation of Associations for Hunting and Conservation of the EU (FACE)); Anke Hahn (Transeconect); Anne-Sophie Croyal (Conseil general de Lâ€™Isere, France); Michael Proschek Hauptmann (Umweltdachverband, Austria); Riccardo Santolini (Univ. of Urbino, Italy); Karl Buchgraber (LFZ Raumberg-Gumpenstein, Austria); Rebecca Drury (FIWI, Austria), Marianne Badura (BLUE!).
