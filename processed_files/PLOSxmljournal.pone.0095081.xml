However, the general consensus is that PAs still remain effective in habitat conservation. To assess the efficacy of landscape-level conservation, we examined landscape alterations in the Changbai Mountain Biosphere Reserve (CMBR), which was established in 1960 as a â€œflagshipâ€ protected area in China. Based on analyses of high-resolution satellite images and data of forest inventory, field survey and interview, we developed two new indexes to assess the efficacy of landscape conservation, i.e. the quality index of protected landscape and the interference index of anthropogenic landscape. From 1993 to 2012, the quality index increased from 74.48 to 75.50, and the interference index decreased from 0.49 to 0.06, suggesting that the overall quality of protected landscape improved and the degree of anthropogenic interference decreased in CMBR. The increase in landscape quality was mainly due to the progressive vegetation recovery of previous cutover land in the windthrow area, the cease of the use of the cultivated land, and the amelioration of spatial pattern of protected landscape. We conclude that the current landscape conservation methods used in CMBR are effective, and the method we developed has the potential to be used to assess the efficacy of landscape-level conservation in nature reserves worldwide.This study obtained relevant permissions from the administrative bureau of CMBR, and was conducted under the Nature Reserve Regulation and the Wildlife Protection Law of the People's Republic of China.The CMBR is located in the northeast of China. It borders the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to the southeast.We obtained the ZY-1 02C HR orthorectified panchromatic image (spatial resolution 2.36 m), ZY-1 02C P/MS multi-spectral image (spatial resolution 10 m) and LandSat TM image in 2010, with the spatial resolution of 30 m. Both ZY-1 02C HR and P/MS images were acquired in 2012, and provided by China Center for Resource Satellite Data and Application. The TM image was obtained from International Scientific Data Service Platform. The P/MS and TM images were georeferenced to HR orthorectified panchromatic image with submeter accuracy. The ZY-1 02C fusion image (spatial resolution 2.36 m) was generated from HR and P/MS images mentioned above, by using Gram-Schmidt Spectral Sharpening Method.(A) Full map of landscape classification, (B) Young afforested land on northern slope, (b) The ZY-1 02C fusion image of B, (C) Scenic facilities, commerce and service land, highways, and special purposes land near the western gate, (c) ZY-1 02C fusion image of C, (D) Natural forest and grassland on southern slope, (d) ZY-1 02C fusion image of D, (E) Scenic facilities, commerce and service land, special purposes land near the northern gate, (e) The HR panchromatic image of E, (F) Highways and public facilities in the U-shaped valley, (f) The HR panchromatic image of F, (G) Natural forest, sparse forest and grassland on the southern slope, (g) The TM image of G.The interviews focused on changes in the interfered landscape, especially changes in type, area, and spatial distribution from 1993 to 2012.The ZY-1 02C fusion image and HR panchromatic image supplemented with the field survey data were used to classify the artificial landscape. Visual interpretation (i.e. direct delineation and interpretation of the images) was applied. An artificial landscape presented in 2012 was extracted by the ArcMap10.0 software to establish the layer of artificial landscape for that year. The central line was drawn on images of the linear landscape with width less than 10 m. Their patches were generated using bilateral buffering, according to the measured width.Data from the artificial forest, young afforested land, cutover land, land for the forestry facilities, and other lands extracted from the data of forest inventory in 1993 were used, and supplemented with the artificial landscape data interpreted in 2012. In addition, the variation of artificial landscape for 1993-2012 was obtained via interview. The distribution of artificial landscape in 1993 was reconstructed, and the layer of artificial landscapes of 1993 was generated.Using the ArcMap10.0 software, protected landscape with ecological levels of: (1) 0.38 and above (including seven types: natural forest, lake area, sparse forest, shrub forest, grassland, artificial forest, young afforested forest), (2) 0.62 and above (including natural forests, lake area, sparse forest and shrub forest), and (3) 1.00 (natural forest and lake area) were merged into one landscape mosaic, respectively. Integrating different habitat resources into a complete pattern made it possible to analyze the overall influence brought to the survival species due to variations in spatial pattern of habitats.Ld 93-0.38, Ld 93-0.62, Ld 93-1 represents the landscape mosaic composed by protected landscape with ecological levels â‰¥0.38, â‰¥0.62 and â‰¥1 in 1993, respectively. Similarly, Ld12-0.38, Ld12-0.62, Ld12-1 represents the landscape mosaic composed by protected landscape with ecological levels â‰¥0.38, â‰¥0.62 and â‰¥1 in 2012, respectively.Changes in the quality index of protected landscape and the interference index of anthropogenic landscape indicate that from 1993 to 2012 the quality of protected landscape increased and the degree of anthropogenic interference decreased. These results suggest that the protection and management measures used in CMBR are generally effective.Four reasons account for the effectiveness of landscape conservation in CMBR. First, from 1993 to 2012, the cutover land in the windthrow area gradually resembled the natural landscape following the 20 years of recovery. The progressive succession of large areas of this cutover land resulted in the formation of natural forest and sparse forest. This is also the primary reason why the degree of anthropogenic interference decreased and the area of protected landscape increased.Third, the area of cultivated land in the transition area markedly decreased. The cultivated land area in 1993 was primarily distributed along the northern boundary of the biosphere reserve, and contracted to local residents to reclaim. By 2012, the administrative authority of CMBR no longer allowed such use, and most of such cultivated land was abandoned and transformed to artificial forest, grassland, shrub forest, sparse forest and other types of protected landscape.The form of human interference changed fundamentally over the past 20 years, from timber collection in windthrow area to facility and transportation corridor construction for supporting a thriving tourism industry. This change was evident from the observed increase in construction land, especially the increase of commerce and service land, scenic facilities, public facilities and highways (Table S3). In 1990s, tourist activity in CMBR was concentrated on the northern slope of Changbai Mountain. In about 2000, an additional tourist route opened on the western slope, and after the Administration Committee of Changbai Mountain was established in 2005, new tourist routes on the southern slope were also opened. An airport was even constructed outside CMBR.Artificial stimulation (e.g. weed removal and soil surface exposure) may help tree seed germination, and subsequent natural regeneration, because the grassland (above 1500m asl.) transformed from cutover land is not as robust as original natural forest.The continued development of tourism in this region should follow the eco-tourism model and all visitor services should be provided outside of CMBR. Since the hydraulic architecture uses seriously affect protection of biodiversity, it may be beneficial to implement a program to gradually demolish these facilities or re-locate those to less-sensitive ecosystems.The administrative departments of the CMBR should formulate specific regulations, and strengthen the enforcement of those regulations (as with national regulations for the protection of nature reserve). All tourism, production and business activities within the core area and buffer zone should be prohibited. The exploration, planning and resource development in the transition area (especially the development of the construction projects) must: (1) be endorsed by the administrative bureau; (2) follow a strict environmental impact assessment system, and (3) not commence until approved by higher level department of forestry.We conclude that landscape conservation in CMBR is effective, although there still exists some challenges. The methods developed in this study have the potential to be used to assess the efficacy of landscape conservation in PAs worldwide. Ideally it would be much more robust to compare also landscape changes in the surrounding, non-protected area from 1993 to 2012. But, unfortunately, data of forest inventory in 1993 in surrounding area of CMBR is not available.Table S1 Classification accuracy of each type of natural landscape in 2012.
