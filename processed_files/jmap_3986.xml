Flower stage and host plant preference by floral herbivore thrips (Insecta: Thysanoptera: Frankliniella) in a Brazilian savannaThis study shows that three Frankliniella (Thysanoptera) species have species-specific associations with their hosts: F. varipes–Faramea cyanea (Rubiaceae); F. musaeperda–Hancornia speciosa (Apocynaceae) and F. fulvipes–Solanum lycocarpum (Solanaceae). All thrips species had a marked preference for flowers in anthesis, as in this stage flowers provide food and protection from environment. Frankliniella musaeperda and F. varipes populations were female-biased while F. fulvipes was male-biased. Since many species of Frankliniella have economic importance, studies on the ecology of these species are essential, given the possibility of invasion of agricultural systems in the future.
