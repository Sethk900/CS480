Comment to â€œAn umbilical surprise: a collective review on umbilical pilonidal sinusâ€. J. B. Ponten, J. E. H. Ponten, M. D. P. Luyer, S. W. NienhuijsDear Editor, We have read review article published by Ponten et al. [1] with great interest. This presentation of 3 cases of umbilical pilonidal sinus (UPS) includes perhaps the oldest male and female documented patients (patient B and C) until now. Although we agree with most points, there are some additions we wish to suggest.
