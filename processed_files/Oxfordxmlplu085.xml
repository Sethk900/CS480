Exotic plants have the capacity to establish positive plant-soil feedbacks facilitating invader persistence often at the cost of native plant species success. We compared the plant communities, soil chemical and microbial communities and nutrient turnover rates between invaded and restored plots in inland and coastal grasslands. Greater extractable N, slower N cycling rates and differing microbial community composition resulted from restoration. These differences indicate that grassland soils are responsive to vegetation change, and therefore not resistant to invasion-caused feedbacks. It also suggests these soils are resilient to invasion and may be capable of recovery following vegetative restoration.  Grasslands have a long history of invasion by exotic annuals, which may alter microbial communities and nutrient cycling through changes in litter quality and biomass turnover rates. We compared plant community composition, soil chemical and microbial community composition, potential soil respiration and nitrogen (N) turnover rates between invaded and restored plots in inland and coastal grasslands. Restoration increased microbial biomass and fungal : bacterial (F : B) ratios, but sampling season had a greater influence on the F : B ratio than did restoration. Microbial community composition assessed by phospholipid fatty acid was altered by restoration, but also varied by season and by site. Total soil carbon (C) and N and potential soil respiration did not differ between treatments, but N mineralization decreased while extractable nitrate and nitrification and N immobilization rate increased in restored compared with unrestored sites. The differences in soil chemistry and microbial community composition between unrestored and restored sites indicate that these soils are responsive, and therefore not resistant to feedbacks caused by changes in vegetation type. The resilience, or recovery, of these soils is difficult to assess in the absence of uninvaded control grasslands. However, the rapid changes in microbial and N cycling characteristics following removal of invasives in both grassland sites suggest that the soils are resilient to invasion. The lack of change in total C and N pools may provide a buffer that promotes resilience of labile pools and microbial community structure.  The effects of exotic plant invasions on terrestrial ecosystems vary temporally and spatially and span scales ranging from the plant rhizosphere to changes in nutrient flux that occur at the ecosystem level ( Ehrenfeld 2003 ;  Potthoff  et al.  2009 ). Previously, the impacts of exotic invasive plants on soil microbial communities and nutrient fluxes have received considerable attention (e.g.  Jackson  et al.  1988 ,  1989 ;  Bever  et al.  1997 ;  Hawkes  et al.  2005 ,  2006 ;  Wolfe and Klironomos 2005 ). However, belowground responses to restoration practices and studies on the legacy effects of plant invasions are relatively new areas of research ( Potthoff  et al.  2006 ,  2009 ;  Kulmatiski and Beard 2008 ,  2011 ;  Dickens 2010 ;  Dickens and Allen 2014 ). The capacity of invaded systems to recover from short-term and legacy effects of exotic plants is unknown. In addition, the role of legacy effects of exotic invasion and exotic species identity in the success of restoration is unclear, greatly limiting the knowledge base needed for strategic restoration of invaded lands.  One mechanism by which exotic plants impact ecosystems is by decoupling plant–soil feedback loops that previously functioned in soils under native vegetation. We define decoupling here and the interruption of interactions between plants and soil via soil inputs and microbial community responses ( Bardgett  et al.  2013 ). Feedback loops describe how plants, soils and microorganisms interact through resources. For example, a plant species may produce particular soil inputs via senescent biomass and exudates that become resources for soil microbes. Microbes that use these resources determine rates of nutrient cycling and thus nutrient availability to plants. Through this feedback loop, plants and microbes may exert selective pressure on one another ( Wardle 2002 ;  Eviner and Chapin 2003 ;  Santiago  et al.  2005 ;  Santiago 2007 ). In the case of plant invasion, a new species' arrival may alter the microbial community, leading to further modifications of belowground processes such as nutrient turnover or the introduction of microbial species associated with this novel plant. The end result can be inhibition of native plant species and/or the facilitation of the invading, exotic plant species ( Bever  et al.  1997 ;  Ehrenfeld 2003 ;  Wolfe and Klironomos 2005 ).  Introductions of plant species that differ in litter quality, phenology and relative distribution of above and belowground biomass may result in especially strong plant–soil feedbacks. Exotic species may introduce novel nutrient uptake or litter deposition traits that could create positive feedbacks with the soil microbial community ( Grayston  et al.  1998 ;  Eviner 2004 ;  Batten  et al.  2006 ). Exotics may shift the seasonal availability of extractable nitrogen (N) by introducing phenologies with earlier germination and growth rates ( Jackson  et al.  1988 ;  Dickens 2010 ;  Dickens and Allen 2014 ) and changes in soil properties that drive the selection and composition of microbial communities ( Ehrenfeld 2003 ;  Wardle  et al.  2004 ;  Berg and Smalla 2009 ;  Potthoff  et al.  2009 ). Additionally, exotic plant invasion can change cycling and availability of C, N and other nutrients ( Christian and Wilson 1999 ;  Ehrenfeld 2003 ;  Yoshida and Allen 2004 ). Litter with high C : N promotes immobilization of N by microbes resulting in reduced available N ( Brady and Weil 1996 ;  Grayston  et al.  1998 ;  Cione  et al.  2002 ;  Potthoff  et al.  2009 ). Invasion of exotic, annual grasses into a perennial bunchgrass grassland would be expected to introduce litter of lower C : N compared with native perennials which would increase decomposition and N cycling rates ( Eviner and Firestone 2007 ;  Potthoff  et al.  2009 ).  California grasslands are highly invaded by exotic annuals and undergoing restoration in many locations, and thus an ideal system for studying plant–soil feedbacks through decoupling exotic plant species' plant–soil feedbacks using restoration. Plant biomass in grasslands turns over annually ( Jackson  et al.  1988 ) so grassland soils are likely to respond to altered plant inputs over a relatively short time scale. Due to the almost complete conversion of native perennial grasslands with annual forbs to exotic annual grassland with annual forbs ( Biswell 1956 ;  D'Antonio 2007 ;  Minnich 2008 ), native California grasslands are a system of high conservation value and concern. Annual plant invasions began &gt;200 years ago ( Minnich 2008 ), and invasion is so widespread that there are no true relic grasslands to use as reference sites. However, even without relic grasslands, differences in soil microbial community structure, soil chemistry and nutrient flux rates between unrestored and restored soils can be used to evaluate the capacity of grassland soils to respond to changes in vegetation type.  Invasion of original, native grasslands introduced new, exotic plant–soil feedbacks (solid black arrows represent native feedbacks and dotted black arrows represent plant soil feedbacks of exotics). Through restoration efforts plant–soil feedbacks can be altered leading to (A) a restored grassland experiencing no exotic feedbacks and moderate native feedbacks from the re-establishing native community or (B) a partially restored grassland experiencing a much higher proportion of native plant–soil feedbacks than exotic. Thickness of arrows indicates the degree to which feedbacks are influencing the system.  Comparison of site abiotic properties, land-use history and restoration methodologies.  Plant species richness, per cent cover by individual species and per cent of litter cover were measured annually by visual estimation in gridded 1 m 2  frames in each treatment at the peak of the growing season (March) in 2007–09. Net annual productivity of annuals was determined by harvesting biomass in four functional groups (native forb, native grass, exotic forb and exotic grass) clipped at the soil level from 0.25 m 2  sub-plots and scaled up to the 1 m 2  plot size using regression of plant biomass and per cent cover in 0.25 m 2  and per cent cover of 1 m 2  plots. Additional biomass was collected for chemical analysis of the vegetative plant tissue at peak plant growth. All biomass was oven dried at 60 °C and weighed. Biomass for tissue analysis was ground and analysed for total C and N on a soil combustion analyser system (Flash AlllZ, Thermo-Finnigan).  To determine the effects of restoration on soil biological and chemical characteristics, three soil cores of 2.5 cm diameter and 10 cm depth were collected per plot, composited to the plot level and then transported on ice to the laboratory where a portion of each sample was stored at −20 °C until processed for chemical analyses and the remaining portion of the sample at −80 °C for microbial analyses. Soils were analysed for total C and N by combustion, KCl-extractable NO 3  and NH 4 , and bicarbonate-extractable phosphorus (Olsen P) by the University of California Analytical Laboratory at UC Davis (anlab.ucdavis.edu). Soil pH was measured using a 2 : 1 soil : water slurry. Soil cores were collected once annually in 2007 and 2009 at peak growth, and three times annually (at germination, peak plant growth and plant senescence) during 2007–08 for analysis of KCl-extractable N (   N     H   4     +     and    N     O   3     −    ).  Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis was used to determine whether microbial community structure was affected by restoration of the native vegetation. With the exception of Archaea, all other living organisms contain PLFAs as a component of their cellular membranes ( White  et al.  1996 ;  Hedrick  et al.  2000 ). These compounds can be used as biomarkers to identify functional groups of microbes such as Gram-positive bacteria or arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi ( Zelles and Bai 1994 ;  White  et al.  1996 ;  Hedrick  et al.  2000 ). Phospholipid fatty acids are preferable to the use of fatty acids alone as fatty acids can persist in soils for long periods of time representing a legacy of past microbial communities. Phospholipid fatty acid represent living organisms ( White  et al.  1996 ), thus ensuring capture of the current microbial community response to a disturbance such as exotic plant invasion or restoration activities. Samples were collected within 24 h of rainfall or wetting of soils to a 10-year average rainfall volume. Soil samples were passed through a 2-mm sieve and lyophilized prior to extraction. Phospholipid fatty acids were extracted from 6 g of soil following the modified Bligh–Dyer method ( Frostegard  et al.  1991 ). Quantification of fatty acids was obtained using a gas chromatograph (HP6980; Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA) with a flame ionization detector and HP3365 ChemStation Software. Phospholipid fatty acid peaks were converted to PLFA identities and abundances using MIDI Sherlock Microbial Identification System (MIDI, Inc., Newark, NJ, USA) followed by comparison of peak areas with a known internal standard 19 : 0 of known concentration. Bacterial biomarkers included: 14 : 0, 15 : 0 iso, 15 : 0 antiso, 16 : 0 iso, 16 : 0 iso G, 16 : 1 w9c, 16 : 1 w7c, 16 : 0, 16 : 1 2OH, 17 : 1 alcohol, 17 : 0 iso, 17 : 0 antiso, 17 : 0 cyclo, 17 : 1 w8c, 18 : 1 w5c, 18 : 0, 19 : 0 cyclo c11–12, 22 : 0 and 24 : 0 and fungi: 18 : 2 w6c, 18 1w9c and 17 : 0 and AM fungi: 16 : 1 w5c. Nomenclature for PLFAs followed  Lechevalier and Lechevalier (1988) ,  Vestal and White (1989) ,  Zelles (1999) ,  Myers  et al.  (2001)  and  Hebel  et al.  (2009) .  Laboratory incubations for potential N mineralization were performed over a 30-day period in soil samples maintained at 25 °C and 60 % humidity.    N     H   4     +   and   N     O   3     −     were extracted with a 2-M KCl 4 : 1 solution ( Riley and Vitousek 1995 ) and shipped on dry ice for analysis at the University of California Analytical Laboratory at UC Davis (anlab.ucdavis.edu). Net mineralization was calculated as the change in    N     H   4     +     minus the change in    N     O   3     −     over time, and net nitrification was calculated as the change of    N     O   3     −     over time following  Riley and Vitousek (1995) . Potential soil respiration rates were determined using laboratory incubations. Soils were maintained at 20 % soil moisture and 25 °C in sealed glass jars for 10 days. Jar headspace concentrations of CO 2  (ppm) were determined using a LiCor 800 infrared gas analyser (Lincoln, NE, USA) and converted to a rate function of μmol CO 2 -C/g soil × day ( Chatterjee  et al.  2008 ).  Plant species per cent cover and richness were analysed using repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to assess how the vegetative community responded to restoration. Plant biomass and litter, soil chemistry, soil-extractable N, potential soil respiration and N mineralization data were analysed with ANOVA followed by Tukey's HSD to determine whether restoration altered soil chemical pools and cycling rates. Non-normal data were log( x + 1) or square root transformed when appropriate and a Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test was performed in cases where the data could not be transformed to normality. Microbial biomass and F : B were analysed using ANOVA to determine coarse microbial community compositional shifts between treatments. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to create ordination diagrams to compare microbial community compositions, which were then further analysed by ANOVA of PC1 and PC2 values to determine if community composition differed following restoration and across sampling dates. The analyses were conducted using JMP9 ( SAS Institute 2009 ) with an alpha level of  P  ≤ 0.05.  Common species mean per cent cover of inland and coastal grassland plant functional groups during the peak of the 2007–08 season. Repeated-measures MANOVA were conducted to assess differences in plant composition between treatments of unrestored and restored grasslands over 3 years during the 2006–09 growing seasons.  Plant leaf tissue chemical composition for some of the most common species encountered at the two project sites. Five samples of each plant species were analysed and averaged per species.

Graphs (A) and (B) assess differences between treatment while (C) and (D) assess differences between sampling dates. PC1 explains 83 % variation and PC2 has a cumulative per cent variation of 91 % for the inland site, while the coastal site cumulative variance explained by PC1 is 59 % and PC2 is 70 %.

Letters indicate significant differences using ANOVA followed by Tukey–Kramer HSD test: NO 3  = A and B, NH 4  = C and D and total extractable N = E and F. Bars indicate standard error and letters significant differences ( P  ≤ 0.05).  Soil chemical data (means and standard errors) for the burned, inland site and the coastal site collected the summer of 2006. ANOVA was conducted to assess differences in soil chemical characteristics between treatments of unrestored and restored grasslands during the 2006–07 growing season.  Potential N mineralization and nitrification from 30-day laboratory incubations from the inland site (A and C) and the coastal site (B and D) for soils collected in the March (peak) and August (end of the summer dry season) of 2008. Letters indicate significant differences using the Tukey–Kramer HSD test following ANOVA ( P  ≤ 0.05). Bars indicate standard error.  Microbial shifts in community structure and altered extractable N pools and N cycling indicate that exotic plant–soil feedbacks were decoupled following restoration at both sites regardless of differences in soil properties between sites. Decoupling is used here to mean that established interactions between exotic plants and soil organisms were disrupted and replaced to some degree by interactions between native plants and soil organisms ( Bardgett  et al.  2013 ). Native grasses increased at both sites and exotics were reduced leading to shifts in plant inputs, particularly by reducing the proportion of exotic species litter having higher C : N in both sites and increasing the proportion of  S. pulchra  litter with intermediate quality. The reduction of exotic plant inputs followed by replacement by native plant inputs altered the microbial community, increased NO 3 -N availability and nitrification rates and decreased NH 4 -N availability and N mineralization rates. Although no uninvaded grasslands are available as reference sites, these rapid changes indicate that these grasslands have some capacity for soil resilience.  Differences in microbial community biomass, F : B and individual markers (indicated by concentrations of PLFA biomarkers) between unrestored and restored soils support our hypothesis that restoration of the native plant community would decouple the previously existing exotic plant–soil feedbacks and allow for establishment of native plant–soil feedbacks.  Potthoff  et al.  (2009)  found similar shifts in PLFA profiles that they interpreted to indicate resilience of the soil microbial community to disturbance. Restoration reduced microbial biomass values during germination indicating a stronger response of soil microbes in unrestored soils following the first rains, likely due to higher root activity of germinating exotics, rapid decomposition of exotic annual grassland seedlings due to self-thinning ( Bartolome 1979 ;  Savelle 1997 ;  Eviner and Firestone 2007 ) or decomposition of the previous year's microbial biomass. Shifts in microbial community in response to seasonal changes in temperature and moisture, such as those found here, are expected due to species-specific growth requirements ( Pommerville 2007 ). Mycorrhizal fungi may decline in perennial grassland soils invaded by exotic annual grasses, so we expected fungal biomarkers to be lower in unrestored plots ( Hawkes  et al.  2006 ). The grasslands of this experiment had reduced fungal biomarkers, 18 : 2 w6c, 18 : 1w9c and 16 : 1 w5cat germination, but increased fungal markers 18 : 2 w6c and 18 : 1w9c the remainder of the season. Similar to  Hawkes’  et al.  (2006)  findings, our coastal grassland site had lower AM fungi PLFA markers in unrestored plots dominated by exotic annuals, but this did not occur until late in the growing season (i.e. plant senescence). Native plant species tend to have a later phenology than exotics in the semi-arid grasslands and thus experience peak growth rates later into the season than exotic plants ( Jackson and Roy 1986 ;  Holmes and Rice 1996 ). AM fungi associated with exotics have reduced abundance earlier in the season when their exotic, annual host plants senesce ( Nelson and Allen 1993 ). Other fungal groups were also in high concentration during senescence at both sites. Therefore, phenology of the dominant plant species either annual exotics or native annuals to native perennial grassland species was related to the activity of soil microorganisms.  The anticipated shift in N availability occurred and also showed seasonal patterns corresponding to plant phenologies. Total extractable N and NO 3 -N increased with restoration during peak and senescence periods of the growing season as also observed by  Jackson  et al.  (1988 ,  1989 ). One of the more striking results was that extractable N concentrations at the inland site were higher in unrestored soils at plant germination but quickly became significantly lower within 2–3 months, suggesting increased rates of N uptake by plants in the unrestored plots. Plants may take up as much    N     O   3     −     as becomes available ( Jackson  et al.  1988 ,  1989 ). This effect of exotic plant removal on increased mineral N has been observed in both grassland and coastal sage scrub in other studies of semi-arid environments ( Dickens 2010 ;  Dickens and Allen 2014 ). In this study, plant uptake of N was still low at germination, but began to increase rapidly as plant growth reached its maximum rates. The peak and senescence sampling dates at these sites correspond to the periods of maximum annual growth and transition to reproduction phases during which their N use would be highest. California grassland natives tend to germinate and complete their life cycles later than exotic annuals ( Jackson and Roy 1986 ;  Holmes and Rice 1996 ) and likely have continued nutrient uptake closer to the senescence sampling date.  Stipa pulchra  recycles about half its annual N internally and thus may not take up N as soon or at rates as high as those observed for exotic annuals ( Clark 1977 ;  Jackson  et al.  1988 ;  Hooper and Vitousek 1998 ).  Stipa pulchra  is the dominant native so less rapid and total uptake rates would translate to greater overall extractable N left in the soil throughout the season. Restoration led to reduced NH 4 -N and N mineralization but increased nitrification, indicating greater immobilization of N following restoration. In other grasslands, exotic grass invasion is associated with increased N mineralization, which is attributed to a greater abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria ( Hawkes  et al.  2005 ). Here, the biomass of bacteria was higher in unrestored soils, although our PLFA assay could not identify whether these ammonia-oxidizing bacteria were reduced by restoration.  Long-term invasion and anthropogenic disturbance may be one mechanism explaining the resistance of soil total C and N pools and potential respiration to changes under restored plant community conditions. Total soil C and N pools and C cycling may show resistance or may only be slowly responsive to changes in vegetation. These soils have likely been invaded by exotic annual grasses for more than a century ( Minnich 2008 ), so sufficient time has likely passed for total C and N pools to change in response to invasion. Similar resistance of C and N pools were observed in grasslands of northern California when community composition was altered to test legacy effects of plant–soil interactions ( Potthoff  et al.  2009 ). However, decreased soil C was found in invaded grasslands in central California compared with reference patches of native grassland ( Koteen  et al.  2011 ).  Kindscher and Tieszen (1998)  found that tall grass prairie soils may require &gt;35 years to recover C from agricultural use following restoration. The shifts in litter input at our grasslands may not have been great enough to lead to altered C and N pools. Differences and variability in litter quality in grasslands are often subtle making responses to changes in litter difficult to detect ( Eviner and Firestone 2007 ). This suggests that our grasslands could have been resistant to impacts of the initial exotic annual invasion or that restoration must occur for a longer time than 9 years to detect total soil N and C responses. Another contributing factor is the reinvasion of exotic grass following restoration. While native vegetation continued to dominate, exotic species had a continuous impact on the soil.  Between-site differences in restoration responses of extractable N availability and microbial community structure were primarily seasonal. This corresponded with our hypothesis that soil responses are sensitive to environment. In this case, the important environmental influences included soil nutrient and climatic differences. Greater immobilization at the coastal than the inland site may be the result of a 15 % lower soil C : N ratio and 5 % greater soil organic matter content than at the inland site. Higher organic matter in conjunction with lower C : N soil values would allow for higher rates of N mineralization while also leading to increased immobilization overall in restored plots of the coastal site ( Knops  et al.  2002 ;  Berger and Jackson 2003 ). Instead, the inland site had a more stable microbial community (F : B was unchanged) and a steady use of nutrients over the season followed by a second peak of microbial activity at senescence. So while differences in soil nutrient conditions, timing of responses to restoration and specific PLFA concentrations occurred between sites, the patterns of increased NO 3 -N and nitrification, reduced N mineralization and altered microbial community composition following restoration occurred at both sites. This indicates that grassland soils were responsive to changes in vegetation and may therefore be resilient to invasion.  Restoration of invaded grasslands decoupled exotic plant–soil feedbacks related to microbial community structure, extractable N and N cycling. This study indicates that the soils of these systems are dynamic and change in response to exotic or native vegetation type and seasonal variation in soil moisture. Semi-arid grasslands in general are known to be unstable in productivity and reliant on seasonal precipitation patterns ( Talbot  et al.  1939 ). Measured changes in extractable soil N and microbial characteristics in response to removal of exotic plants indicated that grassland soils are not resistant to the impacts of plant community shifts, but have the capacity for resilience regardless of the method of exotic plant control (i.e. prescribed burn, mowing and weeding). This indicates that the method of exotic plant removal is not important in these grasslands, but that removal of exotic plants and decoupling exotic plant–soil feedbacks are required for grassland soils to diverge from invaded conditions. In contrast, the lack of change in total soil C and N pools and potential soil respiration may be an indication that, for these soil characteristics, these grasslands are resistant to invasion. Stable pools of C and N may buffer these soils, enabling resilience of the more labile and rapidly responding mineral N and microbial characteristics. However, the absence of uninvaded grasslands does not allow us to rule out changes in C and N pools that may have occurred long ago or will require a more complete restoration and longer time frames for recovery. The differences between sites regarding the timing of microbial activity and N cycling highlight the importance of matching sampling efforts to seasonality of plant and microbial growth patterns. Overall NO 3 -N use and net N cycling differences between restored and unrestored plots were similar between the coastal and inland sites, indicating that shifts in plant community composition from exotic to native-dominated communities produce the same impact on N regardless of site history, restoration methods and differences in soil type.
