Notes on the behavior and ecology of Reliquia santamarta, an Alpine butterfly (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) from the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia, with comparisons to Nearctic Alpine PieriniSummary Reliquia santamarta is an unusual Pierine butterfly endemic to the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta of northeastern Colombia, where it flies above 3500 m. Its biology is of particular interest because of the possibility that it might be a relict derived from the otherwise Holarctic Pieris callidice group, which it strongly resembles phenotypically. Its behavior was studied afield for comparison with Nearctic members of that group. Male R. santamarta are vigorous hilltoppers, assembling to topographic prominences, while females are frequently encountered at lower elevations. Flight patterns, thermoregulatory postures, and interactions between and within the sexes are all virtually identical to highâ€montane and alpine Nearctic Pieris. The natural host plant was not determined. The role of seasonality in the biology of R. santamarta is discussed. Behavior data alone are inadequate to determine whether R. santamarta is closely related to or strongly convergent with the Nearctic taxa.
