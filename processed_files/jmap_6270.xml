Germination of South African soya bean seed lotsA survey of the germination performance of some South African soya bean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill.] cultivars, produced at different localities, was conducted. Seeds were harvested from two early-maturing (Columbus and Crawford), two intermediate-maturing (Prima and Highveld Top), and two late-maturing cultivars (Ibis and Impala), from seven sites. The standard germination test was performed on all 42 seed lots. Germination performance was not linked to any particular maturity type or cultivar, but locality had a distinct effect. Germination of seeds of some seed lots harvested at Groblersdal and Potchefstroom was reduced, primarily due to the effect of seed-borne pathogens, which resulted in relatively large numbers of dead seeds. At Piet Retief, poor germination performance was inversely related to the large number of abnormal seedlings in the standard germination test, which was due to damaged seed coats. There were highly significant correlations between the number of dead seeds and the incidence of fungal infection, and between the number of abnormal seedlings and seed-coat damage. The predominant seed-borne pathogen was identified as Fusarium equiseti, a fungus not previously reported as being present in South African soya bean seed.
