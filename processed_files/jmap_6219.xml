Interaction between cultivar and soil fertility on grain yield, yield components and grain nitrogen content of wheatThe effect of soil nutrient status on the performance of four wheat cultivars was studied in a long-term field experiment at the University of Pretoria. The objective was to quantify the effect of soil nutrient status on yield, yield components and grain quality characteristics, using a split-plot design in a randomized complete block, replicated four times. Grain yield and nitrogen content differed between cultivars with SST 86 yielding 3903 kgha-1(2.47%N), Inia 4484 kgha−1(2.53%N), Kariega 4447 kgha−1(2.49%N) and Carina 6343 kgha−1(3.58%N). Increasing soil fertility increased grain yield, grain number, spikelet number, grains per spike, grains per spikelet, grain nitrogen, biomass and harvest index, but depressed kernel mass. Significant interactions between cultivar and soil fertility were observed for grain yield, grain number, biomass, harvest index and kernel mass. It is concluded that wheat cultivars differ in their potential to utilize limited soil nutrients to produce yield and quality.
