Assuring the future of prairie grouse: dogmas, demagogues, and getting outside the boxWe discuss the necessity of a paradigm shift among managers toward dealing with the recovery and management of prairie grouse (Tympanuchus spp). To assure the future of these species, we will need to test dogmatic assumptions about grouse and their management and challenge the demagogues who insist on perpetuating untested â€œprinciples.â€ Tolerance for descriptive and qualitative studies is needed. Additionally, managers will need to remove themselves from the box and embrace landowners, theoretical biologists, economists, human-dimensions researchers, marketing and advertising specialists, and many other professionals outside the normal sphere of wildlife management. There is crucial need for a willingness to devise, test, and apply innovative ideas that are not normally considered in the management of grouse species, especially applying management to large areas within ecosystems. A comprehensive plan is needed to guide rangewide prairie grouse management. Planned management systems are needed to provide operational guidance in implementing species plans.
