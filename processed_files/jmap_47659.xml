East–west differentiation in the Marcusenius macrolepidotus species complex in Southern Africa: the description of a new species for the lower Cunene River, Namibia (Teleostei: Mormyridae)This paper critically compares the Southern African bulldog fish species Marcusenius macrolepidotus (Peters, 1852), inhabiting the eastern Lower Zambezi River, and Marcusenius altisambesi Kramer et al., 2007, inhabiting the central Upper Zambezi River, with bulldog fish samples from the western lower Cunene River, a 2600-km range from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic. The three species or forms are well differentiated in morphology and molecular genetics, and differentiation is also present in electric organ discharges. Marcusenius altisambesi and the Cunene sample, which we recognize as Marcusenius multisquamatus sp. nov., are closely related and form a sister taxon to M. macrolepidotus. This result is based on the analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences and genomic Inter-simple-sequence-repeat fingerprinting. Morphological adaptations to life in a torrential escarpment river seem to be present in M. multisquamatus sp. nov. when compared with M. altisambesi, which lives in a reservoir river that periodically floods the savannah. http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:8FE68494-9ED9-428E-B181-E814D25493F2
