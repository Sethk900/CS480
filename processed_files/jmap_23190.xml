The millipede genus Tetracentrosternus Pocock, 1895 (Polydesmida, Paradoxosomatidae, Alogolykinae, Alogolykini), with a description of the first, new species from ThailandAbstract The millipede subfamily Alogolykinae and the tribe Alogolykini are recorded in Thailand for the first time,being represented there by Tetracentrosternus theelorsuensis sp. n. While the new species has characteristics that place it in the genus Tetracentrosternus, it also shows a number of unique features that make it necessary to rediagnose this Oriental genus, as well as to key its three currently known species and map their distributions. The tribes Alogolykini and Polydrepanini, as well as the subfamily Alogolykinae are also briefly redefined.
