Recent research in New England, USA, suggests that an ecological trap, created through timber harvesting on the breeding grounds, may be responsible. Red squirrels (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Tamiasciurus hudsonicus</named-content></italic>) were hypothesized to be the primary nest predator, but definitive identification was lacking. The potential for mast cone crops to affect Rusty Blackbird nest predation via trophic interactions also remains unexamined. Our objectives were to identify the mechanisms by which an ecological trap may be operating in New England through a multiscale analysis of Rusty Blackbird habitat selection and nest survival, as well as predator identification and quantification. We located 72 Rusty Blackbird nests in Maine and New Hampshire in 2011 and 2012, and modeled habitat selection and nest survival as a function of habitat characteristics at the nest patch (5 m) and home range (500 m) scale. We placed camera traps at 29 nests to identify nest predators, and conducted ground surveys to obtain an index of squirrel abundance each year. We found that Rusty Blackbirds selected nest patches with a high basal area of small conifers and low canopy closure. Nest survival was not reduced in harvested stands, but increased with increasing basal area. Percent cover of wetlands and young softwood stands were the best predictors of Rusty Blackbird selection at the home range scale. At the home range scale, we found that nests that were closer to a road were less successful in 2011, but not in 2012. Red squirrels were the most frequent predator of Rusty Blackbird nests in 2012, when they were abundant following a mast year in 2011. These results suggest that dense cover of small softwoods is important for habitat selection and survival of Rusty Blackbird nests, and that precommercial thinning and possibly road-building could reduce habitat quality for this species.Les populations d'<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Euphagus carolinus</named-content></italic> ont chut&eacute; depuis le milieu du 20<sup>e</sup> si&egrave;cle.

Among these species, Rusty Blackbirds (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Euphagus carolinus</named-content></italic>) have experienced one of the most severe declines, decreasing by ~95&percnt; in the last half-century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Niven1">Niven et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Greenberg1">Greenberg and Matsuoka 2010</xref>). The boreal forest is a complex ecosystem, with many species exhibiting cyclical fluctuations in abundance due to resource pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Krebs1">Krebs et al. 2014</xref>). In addition, anthropogenic modification of habitat in the region is increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Wells1">Wells 2011</xref>). Effective conservation of Rusty Blackbirds, as well as other boreal species, requires a holistic understanding of their ecology and how interactions with their environment, other organisms, and anthropogenic disturbance act in concert to drive demographic patterns.A recent study in Maine, USA, suggested that regenerating clear-cuts may act as &ldquo;ecological traps&rdquo; for Rusty Blackbirds because they structurally resemble their preferred nesting habitat of stunted, wetland conifers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Powell4">Powell et al. 2010a</xref>). Rusty Blackbirds usually nest in short or stunted conifers in bogs, fens, and along beaver (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Castor canadensis</named-content></italic>) flowages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Avery1">Avery 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Matsuoka1">Matsuoka et al. 2010</xref>). Because nests in regenerating clear-cuts are often in upland settings rather than in wetlands, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Powell4">Powell et al. (2010a)</xref> suggested that these nests may be subject to increased rates of predation by red squirrels (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Tamiasciurus hudsonicus</named-content></italic>), the most common predator of songbird nests in upland northern coniferous forests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Bayne2">Bayne and Hobson 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Willson1">Willson et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Ball1">Ball et al. 2009</xref>).

A multiscale perspective is also critical, as both habitat selection and nest survival are the result of patterns and processes operating at scales from meters (e.g., the nest patch) to kilometers (e.g., the landscape context; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Orians1">Orians and Wittenburger 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Chalfoun3">Chalfoun et al. 2002</xref>). The process of habitat selection by birds is hierarchical, whereby selection at coarser scales constrains selection at finer scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Hutto1">Hutto 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Orians1">Orians and Wittenburger 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Jones1">Jones 2001</xref>), and many predator&ndash;habitat associations are sensitive to patterns at the landscape scale (e.g., &ge;500-m radius; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Chalfoun3">Chalfoun et al. 2002</xref>). Previous research has found that the response of red squirrels to forest fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Bayne1">Bayne and Hobson 1997</xref>) and the prevalence of squirrel predation of songbird nests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Bayne1">Bayne and Hobson 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Bayne3">Bayne et al. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Tewksbury2">Tewksbury et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Tewksbury1">2006</xref>) vary with landscape context (e.g., agricultural vs. forested area, deciduous vs. coniferous forest), further highlighting the importance of examining characteristics of the wider landscape in which Rusty Blackbird nests are embedded.Given that previous studies of nesting habitat selection and nest success in Rusty Blackbirds have focused on local or nest patch scales (5&ndash;20 m around the nest; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Matsuoka1">Matsuoka et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Powell4">Powell et al. 2010a</xref>), our first objective was to model Rusty Blackbird habitat selection and nest survival at multiple spatial scales relevant to the species' ecology as well as to forest management. At the nest patch scale, we predicted that Rusty Blackbirds would select forest patches with more short conifers relative to reference patches, and that nest survival would be lower in harvested stands than in wetlands due to increased exposure to upland predators such as squirrels. Definitive identification of nest predators has also been lacking in previous studies. Without knowledge of predator identity, efforts to mitigate the detrimental effects of nest predation are likely to be of limited value because the response of nest predators to habitat features is often taxon-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Chalfoun3">Chalfoun et al. 2002</xref>). Our second objective, therefore, was to identify the predators of Rusty Blackbird nests, which we predicted would be primarily red squirrels. Our final objective was to examine correlations among nest predation, conifer mast, and predator cycles. Because cones are a pulsed resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Krebs1">Krebs et al. 2014</xref>), and are the primary food source for red squirrels, we expected that squirrel abundance and predation of Rusty Blackbird nests would be higher following a cone mast year. A more comprehensive understanding of how both ecological processes and anthropogenic factors influence Rusty Blackbird nest predation will provide critical insight into how best to manage northern forests to conserve this increasingly rare species.We worked in 2 study sites in northern New England, USA: the Moosehead Lake region of north-central Maine, near Greenville (45&deg;28&prime;N, 69&deg;33&prime;W), and the Umbagog Lake&ndash;Androscoggin River region of northern New Hampshire, near Errol (44&deg;46&prime;N, 71&deg;8&prime;W). Both sites have a range of elevation of ~300&ndash;1,000 m and are managed for forest products, but they differ in topography and in the composition of the matrix forest. In Maine, broad expanses of flat, wet lowlands are interspersed with relatively isolated areas of topographic relief. In these flats, red and black spruce (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Picea rubens</named-content></italic> and <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. mariana</named-content></italic>) and balsam fir (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Abies balsamea</named-content></italic>) dominate stands, where they are part of a mosaic of managed softwood stands and beaver flowages. Speckled alder (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Alnus incana</named-content></italic> ssp. <italic>rugosa</italic>) is common in wetlands. Upland areas and slopes tend to host more hardwoods, and are characterized by a mixed forest of red and sugar maples (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Acer rubrum</named-content></italic> and <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. saccharum</named-content></italic>), quaking and big-toothed aspens (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Populus tremuloides</named-content></italic> and <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. grandidentata</named-content></italic>), American beech (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Fagus grandifolia</named-content></italic>), and paper and yellow birches (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Betula papyrifera</named-content></italic> and <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. alleghaniensis</named-content></italic>) as well as spruces and firs. Most of the study site is owned and managed by the timber industry, with some held by nonprofit organizations.In contrast, the New Hampshire study site is mountainous. Although there are some low-lying flats, they account for a relatively small proportion of the landscape, which is dominated by upland forests of mostly hardwood species (maples, beech, birches), occasionally mixed with spruces and firs. Wetlands in this study site are concentrated in river valleys between steep slopes. Unlike the forests in Maine, young softwood stands are discrete and isolated, surrounded by a matrix of mixed hardwood forest. Here, too, most of the lands are managed by industrial forest owners, but with significant areas owned and managed by the Umbagog National Wildlife Refuge.Because of differences in terrain and associated logistical constraints, methods for detecting birds at the beginning of the breeding season differed between the Maine and New Hampshire study sites. In Maine, where the target survey area was large and birds were widely dispersed across the landscape, we used the road-based survey protocol developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Powell2">Powell (2008)</xref>, which consisted of an initial 3-min listening period followed by a 40-s broadcast of a Rusty Blackbird vocalization using a game caller (Predation MP3; Western Rivers, Lexington, Tennessee, USA; and Model FX3, FoxPro, Northbrook, Illinois, USA), then a second 5-min listening period. In New Hampshire, where the target survey area was smaller and birds were concentrated along rivers, we identified potential Rusty Blackbird habitat using Google Earth (Google, Mountain View, California, USA) and stand maps. Surveys consisted of a 30-min period of passive listening, without a vocalization broadcast.Despite different survey methodologies, the key habitat features used to select survey points (young softwood stands and wetlands) were the same in both Maine and New Hampshire, whether identified on the ground or with the aid of remote sensing. Therefore, because the type of habitat where we surveyed for Rusty Blackbirds and searched for nests was the same in both study sites, we think it unlikely that the different approaches biased our interpretation of habitat preferences.After locating occupied territories, we searched for nests from sunrise to sunset using behavioral cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Martin3">Martin and Geupel 1993</xref>). We installed motion-triggered, infrared cameras within 3 m of nests as habitat conditions permitted. Over our 2 field seasons, we used 3 different camera models: Reconyx Hyperfire HC600 (Reconyx, Holmen, Wisconsin, USA), Bushnell Trophy Cam (Bushnell Outdoor Products, Overland Park, Kansas, USA) and Uway NightTrakker NT50B (Uway Outdoors Canada, Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada). When possible, we mounted cameras on adjacent natural vegetation (usually sapling or pole-stage conifers), approximately level with the nest. When there were no suitable trees for attachment in the vicinity of the nest, we mounted the camera on a pole created from a young, live conifer or a snag.We set cameras at the maximum sensitivity level and programmed them to take the maximum number of photos per trigger event (3 or 5 exposures depending on the camera model). We avoided installing cameras until egg laying was completed, as the disturbance of installation during earlier stages in the breeding cycle may result in nest abandonment (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Richardson1">Richardson et al. 2009</xref>). We checked cameras and nests every 3&ndash;5 days. During each visit, camera position and batteries were checked and adjusted as necessary, and memory cards were replaced. We also examined nest contents using either binoculars or a mirror pole to assess nesting stage and the number of eggs or young present.We deployed cameras at 29 nests: 10 in Maine in 2011, and 11 in Maine and 8 in New Hampshire in 2012. We were unable to use cameras in New Hampshire in 2011. Camera installation at nests in New Hampshire in 2012 was avoided during incubation to prevent interference with concurrent studies.To develop an index of spruce&ndash;fir cone abundance, we counted cones in each 5-m nest plot and in a control plot located 50 m away, following a modified version of the Mountain Bird Watch protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Hart1">Hart and Lambert 2010</xref>). Starting from the nest or control plot center point, we estimated the total number of cones on the nearest cone-bearing spruce or fir in each cardinal direction. If there were no cone-bearing trees within a 5-m radius, we extended the radial distance to 11 m. If no cone-bearing trees were located within an 11-m radius, then 0 cones were recorded. If the nest tree had cones, its cone count replaced that of the cone-bearing tree farthest from the nest.Because of their predicted importance as Rusty Blackbird nest predators, we conducted call broadcast surveys for red squirrels at nest sites. In 2011 and 2012, we conducted 1 survey at each nest after the young had fledged, to avoid disturbance around active nests. Squirrel surveys consisted of a 5-min passive listening period, a 20-s broadcast of territorial calls, and then a second 5-min listening period. Due to the lack of a functional game caller in the second half of the 2011 season, the surveys in New Hampshire in 2011 consisted of 10 min of passive listening without a call broadcast. In order to gauge population changes across the 2 yr of the study, we resurveyed each 2011 nest site in 2012 in both Maine and New Hampshire, and used these results in the analyses comparing squirrel abundance between years. In the analyses, we corrected for the lack of a call broadcast in New Hampshire in 2011 by only counting the squirrels that we heard in the first 5 min (prebroadcast) of the 2012 surveys. Therefore, any estimate of an increase in population from 2011 to 2012 is conservative, as it does not include any individuals detected after the call broadcast in New Hampshire.Following the completion of each nesting attempt, we measured vegetation and habitat characteristics within a 5-m radius plot centered on each nest, following a protocol modified slightly from that used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-James1">James and Shugart (1970)</xref>, and later by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Powell4">Powell et al. (2010a)</xref>. We recorded the location of each nest with a handheld GPS. We defined harvest history around nests at the 5-m scale (i.e. nest patch scale) because nests in unharvested wetlands were often near the wetland&ndash;upland interface, and the upland was all managed or harvested. We classified nest plots as &ldquo;harvested&rdquo; or &ldquo;unharvested&rdquo; in the field initially, but subsequently used ArcGIS (ESRI, Redlands, California, USA) and stand data layers provided by forest managers to confirm our classifications. We considered nests to be in a harvested stand if they were placed in an area that the landowner identified as a commercial, managed stand. The category &ldquo;harvested&rdquo; included all types of harvest treatment (complete and partial overstory removal, thinning, etc.), and although we did not know exact ages or treatment types for most of the stands in which nests were placed, the majority of nests in &ldquo;harvested&rdquo; areas were in stands composed of trees &le;3 m tall, with DBH (diameter at breast height) &le;5 cm. Based on tree sizes, we estimated that most nests were in 10- to 20-yr-old regeneration that had not been thinned.All of the nests classified as being in unharvested habitats were in obvious wetlands (e.g., a flooded beaver impoundment), and most of these areas were classified as &ldquo;nonproductive forest&rdquo; in the GIS data that we received from forest managers. There was one nest, however, that we classified as being in unharvested habitat despite being in a stand identified by the landowner as a managed stand. Because of a recent beaver impoundment, the stand was flooded by water 1 m deep, which killed many of the trees and completely changed the physical structure of the habitat, such that it was effectively an &ldquo;unharvested wetland.&rdquo; The GIS data likely had not been updated to reflect the recent changes to the landscape, and we determined that including this nest in the &ldquo;harvested&rdquo; category would be a misrepresentation of the current conditions on the ground.We visually estimated the percent cover of herbaceous, shrub, and tree species within a 5-m radius of each nest. We defined a &ldquo;shrub&rdquo; as any woody plant &le;3 m tall (including saplings); a &ldquo;tree&rdquo; was &gt;3 m high. We measured nest height to the nearest 0.1 m, and recorded the number of vertical stems supporting the nest. We recorded nest-tree species, height (m), and DBH (cm). We counted woody stems in 1-m height-class intervals every meter along 5-m transects in each cardinal direction using a 3-m PVC pole. Each branch touching the pole was traced back to its central stem (bole), and we counted the number of stems contributing branches that touched the pole for each species in each height interval. For vegetation &gt;3 m tall, we visually estimated the number of stems of each species. At these same points, we estimated canopy closure using an ocular tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-James1">James and Shugart 1970</xref>).We used a 10-factor prism (English scale) to determine the total basal area of trees surrounding the nest. To get tree-trunk diameter distributions, we measured trees with a DBH &gt;10 cm to the nearest 0.1 cm using a diameter tape. We used a jig notched in 2-cm intervals (i.e. 0&ndash;2, 2&ndash;4, etc.) to facilitate rapid measurement of diameters &le;10 cm. We measured nest concealment in each of the 4 cardinal directions by centering a 1-square-foot grid (0.09 m<sup>2</sup>) on the nest and estimating the percentage of the grid covered by vegetation when standing 1 m away.We made these same measurements at a reference point located 50 m away from the nest in a random cardinal direction. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Powell4">Powell et al. (2010a)</xref>, reference plots were centered on a suitable Rusty Blackbird nest substrate (i.e. a live conifer 1&ndash;5 m tall).We used ArcGIS ArcMap 10.0 (ESRI, Redlands, California, USA) to map nest locations and surrounding landscape characteristics. For each study site, we generated a number of random control points within 750 m of a road (the maximum distance from a nest to a road) equal to the number of nests monitored. We calculated the percent area of different stand and wetland types within a 500-m radius of each nest and random point. We chose this distance because of its relevance to Rusty Blackbird spatial ecology during the breeding season. The mean home range size of 37.5 ha for Rusty Blackbirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Powell3">Powell et al. 2010b</xref>), if circular, would have a 347-m radius. Home range sizes were quite variable, however, ranging from &lt;10 ha (178-m radius) to over 150 ha (691-m radius; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Powell3">Powell et al. 2010b</xref>). Therefore, 500 m seemed a relevant scale at which Rusty Blackbirds might respond to landscape features. We obtained stand-level data, including species composition, size class, and other pertinent information, from GIS maps provided by forest managers.We obtained wetland information from the National Wetland Inventory (NWI) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fws.gov/wetlands/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.fws.gov/wetlands/</ext-link>). Because many wetland boundaries had shifted or new wetlands had formed since the NWI data was created, we used 2011 National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) aerial photo imagery (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.maine.gov/geolib/wms.htm" xlink:type="simple">http://www.maine.gov/geolib/wms.htm</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://granitweb.sr.unh.edu:6080/arcgis/services/Image-Services/NH_NAIP_2011_RGB/ImageServer?WMSServer" xlink:type="simple">http://granitweb.sr.unh.edu:6080/arcgis/services/Image-Services/NH_NAIP_2011_RGB/ImageServer?WMSServer</ext-link>) to digitize wetland features at a 1:5,000 scale to match current, on-the-ground conditions. We reclassified the various wetland types into 3 major categories (sensu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Cowardin1">Cowardin et al. 1979</xref>): palustrine forest and scrub&ndash;shrub wetland (PFO&lowbar;PSS), palustrine emergent wetland (PEM), and palustrine unconsolidated bottom wetland (PUB). We used ArcGIS to calculate the distance from each nest to the nearest road and the nearest wetland of any type.We calculated mean &plusmn; SE for habitat features at the nest tree, nest patch, and home range scales, and used nonparametric Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests to compare habitat variables around nests in Maine vs. New Hampshire at each spatial scale. We developed a list of variables that we thought might influence selection at the nest patch and home range scales based on previous studies as well as our own field experience (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-t01">Table 1</xref>).Description of variables used to model Rusty Blackbird habitat selection at the nest patch and home range scale in northern New England, USA, 2011&ndash;2012.We collected several different metrics in the field (pole transect, basal area, percent cover) representing conifer and alder densities around nests. In these cases, we compared the fit of univariate models using Akaike's Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AIC<sub>c</sub>) to determine which variables best represented conifer density and alder density around nests, and included these in subsequent analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Burnham1">Burnham and Anderson 2002</xref>). For habitat selection analyses, the best variable describing conifer density was basal area of small conifers (DBH &le;10 cm), while the frequency of alder stems (as measured by pole transects) best represented alder density.We modeled habitat selection at the nest patch and home range scales using logistic regression in R 2.15.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-RDevelopmentCoreTeam1">R Development Core Team 2012</xref>). At the nest patch scale, we used matched pairs logistic regression (MPLR) analysis with a 1:1 case&ndash;control design to test all univariate and multivariate combinations of the 3 habitat covariates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-t01">Table 1</xref>). We performed a logistic regression on the differences between habitat measurements taken at nest points and their paired random points, which amounts to a conditional logistic regression and, therefore, lacks an intercept term (Hosmer and Lemeshow 1989). Because of the matched-pair structure of the data at the nest patch scale, including Site as a covariate in the models and testing for interactions with habitat variables was problematic. Preliminary modeling of each study site separately yielded virtually identical results, so we pooled data from Maine and New Hampshire in the final analysis and omitted Site as a covariate. Our sample size for modeling habitat selection at the nest patch scale was 72, and we analyzed a total of 8 candidate models.Nest and reference points were not matched pairs at the home range scale; thus, we modeled nesting habitat selection using standard logistic regression (Hosmer and Lemeshow 1989). At the home range scale, we tested 3 forest variables and 4 wetland variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-t01">Table 1</xref>). We tested each covariate in a univariate model and all bivariate combinations of forest with wetland variables. We also tested each of the aforementioned models with site interaction terms, for a total of 37 candidate models at the home range scale. Our sample size for modeling habitat selection at the home range scale was 56. We examined predictor variables for correlations at each spatial scale using Spearman's rank correlations, and did not include highly correlated variables (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> &ge; 0.5) in the same model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Booth1">Booth et al. 1994</xref>).Because reference points at the home range scale were randomly generated in ArcGIS, we could not confirm that there were no Rusty Blackbirds present at those locations. However, because Rusty Blackbirds are so uncommon, and the probability of finding them is low even in their preferred habitats, we are confident that the number of reference locations that actually contained an active Rusty Blackbird nest was extremely low. Therefore, we analyzed data at the home range scale using the same assumptions as for a case&ndash;control design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Keating1">Keating and Cherry 2004</xref>).We calculated odds ratios for habitat variables that were determined to be important based on their AIC<sub>c</sub> values in our modeling results, and used model-averaged coefficient estimates to calculate odds ratios. Habitat variables are often more readily interpreted using larger unit change (i.e. &gt;1) ratios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Hosmer1">Hosmer and Lemeshow 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Hein1">Hein et al. 2008</xref>), so we used scaled odds ratios. We used a unit change of 5 m<sup>2</sup> ha<sup>&minus;1</sup> for basal area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Hein1">Hein et al. 2008</xref>), and a change of 10&percnt; for percent cover variables (Compton et al. 2000, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Hein1">Hein et al. 2008</xref>). Because the use of all habitat types by Rusty Blackbirds is low, we interpreted odds ratios as measures of relative risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Keating1">Keating and Cherry 2004</xref>). We considered the coefficient estimate and standard error to be zero for a variable that did not appear in a model, and used the Delta method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Powell1">Powell 2007</xref>) to calculate associated standard errors for scaled odds ratios. We report all coefficient (beta) estimates used to calculate odds ratios, scaled odds ratios, and, for ease of interpretation, the relative change in odds expressed as a percentage when the change in odds is between 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Compton1">Compton et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Hein1">Hein et al. 2008</xref>).For each important habitat variable, we also plotted the predicted probability of nesting given the observed range of values for that variable. Predicted values were generated using the top model at each spatial scale.We used Program MARK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-White1">White and Burnham 1999</xref>) to model the daily survival rate (DSR) of nests as a function of different habitat variables at the nest patch (5 m) and home range (500 m) scales. We also examined whether nest survival varied over the duration of the nesting season or with nest age, and whether there was an effect of study site or year. We developed a set of candidate models for each spatial scale (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-t02">Table 2</xref>), and then used AIC<sub>c</sub> values to determine the best model for each spatial scale.Description of variables used to model Rusty Blackbird nest survival at the nest patch and home range scale in northern New England, USA, 2011&ndash;2012.At the nest patch scale, we tested each habitat covariate in combination with year, site, Cut (harvested or unharvested habitat), and Red Squirrel (the presence of red squirrels near the nest site), for a total of 35 candidate models. As with the habitat selection analyses, we first compared variables representing conifer and alder density as univariate models in MARK, and then selected the best variable in each category to include in the final set of covariates at the nest patch scale. For the nest survival analyses, the best variables were total basal area and percent cover of alder trees. Because we thought that predation risk might vary over the duration of the nesting season and with nest age, we tested models including Red Squirrel and nest age, as well as the linear and quadratic effects of date. We also tested the interaction between total basal area and Cut, because we thought that the effect of vegetation density around nests might differ depending on harvest history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Rudnicky1">Rudnicky and Hunter 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Powell4">Powell et al. 2010a</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Rudnicky1">Rudnicky and Hunter (1993)</xref> found that while dense cover of conifers was generally beneficial for survival of nests in Maine industrial forests, it was not beneficial in stands that had been clear-cut in the last 10 yr. They suggested this may have been due to nest predators such as squirrels staying close to dense cover when moving through recent cuts, in order to avoid predation themselves by larger predators. We did not test models including both Red Squirrel and year because these variables were confounded.We excluded 7 nests with incomplete data from nest survival analyses: 2 that were abandoned immediately following camera installation, 2 for which no eggs were confirmed, 2 found postfledging, and 1 for which fledging date was unknown. Therefore, our sample size for modeling nest survival at the nest patch scale was 65.For the home range scale analyses, we selected forest and wetland type variables that could influence nest survival based on the ecology of red squirrels, as well as potentially important variables from a nest predation perspective (e.g., distance to the nearest road; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-King1">King and DeGraaf 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Ortega1">Ortega and Capen 2002</xref>). In addition, we included the variable representing percent cover of young softwoods because of its importance in habitat selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Matsuoka1">Matsuoka et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Powell4">Powell et al. 2010a</xref>). Pole-sized softwoods were the oldest and largest softwoods found in any abundance in the Maine study site, and so to evaluate the effect of older forests in both study sites, we combined both pole-sized softwoods and mature softwoods into the variable PoleMatureSoft. For all habitat variables, we tested for main and interaction effects of year and study site because we thought that there could be spatial and/or temporal variation in their relationships with nest survival. Our sample size for modeling nest survival at the home range scale was 50, and we tested a total of 28 candidate models.The nesting season start date was standardized to May 7 for both years and both study sites. To estimate nest survival, we used model-averaged daily survival rates (DSR) from nest patch scale models to calculate nest survival over 27 exposure days beginning on the mean date of clutch initiation. We used estimates from the nest patch scale models because we had a larger sample size for the analysis at that scale. We used the Delta method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Powell1">Powell 2007</xref>) to calculate the variance of nest success estimates.For each nest and control plot, we averaged the cone count from each of the 4 transects to get the mean number of cones per plot. Because patterns of cone and squirrel abundance were similar in Maine and New Hampshire, we pooled the cone count and red squirrel survey data from both study sites. We compared cone abundance between 2011 and 2012 using Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests. Because we resurveyed the same points from 2011 in 2012, we compared the proportion of surveys with red squirrel detections in 2011 and 2012 using McNemar's tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Zar1">Zar 1984</xref>). We analyzed cone and squirrel data using R 2.15.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-RDevelopmentCoreTeam1">R Development Core Team 2012</xref>).For model selection analyses, we considered models with &Delta;AIC<sub>c</sub> &le; 2 to have substantial empirical support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Burnham1">Burnham and Anderson 2002</xref>).

Nest heights and nest-tree sizes were similar in the 2 study sites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-t03">Table 3</xref>). The majority of nests in our study (88&percnt;) were placed in harvested stands, and most of the basal area surrounding nests was composed of small, young trees (DBH &le;4 cm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-f01">Figure 1</xref>).Descriptive statistics (mean &plusmn; SE) of habitat characteristics at Rusty Blackbird nests and reference points (Ref) at multiple scales, and comparison of nesting habitat between nests in Maine and New Hampshire, USA, 2011&ndash;2012.Mean basal area of different diameter at breast height classes (DBH range) around Rusty Blackbird nests (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 72) in northern New England, USA, 2011&ndash;2012.There were differences in nest patch habitats between Maine and New Hampshire (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-t03">Table 3</xref>).

There were differences between Maine and New Hampshire in the landscape composition around nests (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-t03">Table 3</xref>). Nests in Maine had more than 3 times the area of wetland cover in the surrounding landscape compared with nests in New Hampshire (20&percnt; and 6&percnt;, respectively). The forest composition around nests also differed between the 2 study sites, with Maine having significantly more young and pole-stage softwood stands, and New Hampshire significantly more mature softwood stands and hardwood stands (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-t03">Table 3</xref>).We found evidence for an effect of young softwoods on habitat selection at the home range scale, and of an interaction between site and wetlands (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-t06">Table 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-f03">Figure 3</xref>).

Poor image quality prevented definitive predator identification at 1 nest, but given the nocturnal timing and the animal's size and shape, it may have been a flying squirrel (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Glaucomys</named-content></italic> sp.) or, less likely, a red squirrel. Two of the 4 definitive red squirrel predation events were likely perpetrated by the same individual, given that they were on subsequent nests of the same pair, only 90 m apart. We did not document any red squirrels depredating nests in New Hampshire.Cone abundance decreased significantly from 2011 to 2012 (2011: <italic>n</italic> &equals; 76, mean &equals; 35.72 &plusmn; 4.44 cones; 2012: <italic>n</italic> &equals; 68, mean &equals; 12.12 &plusmn; 5.02 cones; <italic>U</italic> &equals; 4140.5, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Squirrel detections at nest sites increased from 2011 to 2012 (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 34, McNemar's &chi;<sup>2</sup> &equals; 4.69, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.03).We found that nesting habitat preferences and nest survival rates of Rusty Blackbirds in northern New England were similar to those determined by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Matsuoka1">Matsuoka et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Powell4">Powell et al. 2010a</xref>), and that red squirrels were the most frequent predator of Rusty Blackbird nests in Maine. We did not find evidence that harvested stands acted as ecological traps for Rusty Blackbirds, as the preference for patches of short, dense conifers appeared to be adaptive even when such habitat was the result of harvesting. High basal area of small conifers and a lack of overhead canopy closure were the most important predictive covariates of nest patch habitat selection by Rusty Blackbirds, and total basal area (highly correlated with basal area of small conifers) had a strong positive effect on daily nest survival, irrespective of harvest history. In contrast to the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Powell4">Powell et al. (2010a)</xref> in Maine, harvest history did not receive much support in our models. This may be due to lower squirrel abundance in younger stands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Holloway1">Holloway and Malcolm 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Herbers1">Herbers and Klenner 2007</xref>).Although the percent cover of young softwoods was also an important predictor of habitat selection by Rusty Blackbirds at the home range scale, wetland cover was relatively more important at this scale, perhaps because wetlands were patchy and covered a small fraction of the landscape around nests. This was particularly apparent in the mountainous New Hampshire study site, where palustrine wetlands were scarcer than in Maine. While birds in both study sites favored areas with more wetlands relative to reference areas, the positive effect of wetlands on habitat selection in New Hampshire was more than twice as strong as in Maine (increased odds of 5.5 and 2.5, respectively, with each 10&percnt; increase in wetland cover).Our results suggest that there are different factors driving habitat selection at different spatial scales, which supports the concept of habitat selection as a hierarchical process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Johnson1">Johnson 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Orians1">Orians and Wittenburger 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Chalfoun2">Chalfoun and Schmidt 2012</xref>). Studies of breeding habitat selection by Yellow-headed Blackbirds (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus</named-content></italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Orians1">Orians and Wittenburger 1991</xref>) and Brewer's Sparrows (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Spizella breweri</named-content></italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Chalfoun1">Chalfoun and Martin 2007</xref>) have indicated that food availability is of primary importance at the territory and larger spatial scales, whereas selection of nest sites is based on microhabitat features that reduce nest predation and is independent of selection of foraging habitat. The decoupling of cues for selection of nesting and foraging habitat may be especially strong for species with high mobility and/or large home ranges, which is the case for many blackbird species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Orians1">Orians and Wittenburger 1991</xref>).We found that nest survival increased with increasing distance from a road in 2011, but not in 2012. Given that all 3 of the non-squirrel predators identified (deer, <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Accipiter</named-content></italic> sp., Blue Jay) depredated nests within 50 m of a gravel logging road, perhaps there is some association between these predators and the open habitat created by roads. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Small1">Small and Hunter (1988)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Askins1">Askins (1994)</xref> suggested that logging roads may adversely affect nest success by acting as corridors for predators, yet several empirical studies have not found any relationship between roads and nest predation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Yahner1">Yahner and Mahan 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-King1">King and DeGraaf 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Ortega1">Ortega and Capen 2002</xref>). The negative relationship between distance to road and nest survival may not have been apparent in our study in 2012 because red squirrels were the dominant predators, and they tend to avoid open areas such as clearings and roads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Bakker1">Bakker and Van Vuren 2004</xref>) due to the risk of predation by raptors and mammalian carnivores. Although red squirrels may be less prevalent along roads, it is unlikely that nesting near roads provides protection against predation given that roads may facilitate the movement of and detection by other predators.As we predicted, red squirrels were the most frequent predator of Rusty Blackbird nests in our study, at least in Maine. Our results suggest a possible relationship between spruce&ndash;fir cone production, red squirrel abundance, and Rusty Blackbird nest survival. Following abundant cone mast production in 2011, squirrel numbers increased significantly in 2012. All of the observed red squirrel predation of Rusty Blackbird nests occurred in 2012, when squirrels were more abundant. In British Columbia, Canada, the nest predation rate of forest songbirds also varied with yearly fluctuations in red squirrel abundance, which increased following masting by Sitka spruce (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Picea sitchensis</named-content></italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Martin1">Martin and Joron 2003</xref>). Our red squirrel surveys suggest that the increased rate of squirrel predation that we observed in 2012 was the result of a numerical response to abundant resources in the previous year, but it could also have been the result of a functional response to a lack of cones in 2012. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Mahon1">Mahon and Martin (2006)</xref> found strong yearly differences in the rate of red squirrel predation of Chestnut-backed Chickadee (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Poecile rufescens</named-content></italic>) nests in Arizona, but no differences in squirrel abundance between years. They attributed this increased rate of squirrel predation to prey-switching in years with low cone abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Mahon1">Mahon and Martin 2006</xref>). In the Adirondack Mountains of New York, USA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Jensen1">Jensen et al. (2012)</xref> observed a positive numerical response in the summer red squirrel population to deciduous tree mast in the previous autumn; northern flying squirrels (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Glaucomys sabrinus</named-content></italic>) responded positively to autumn conifer mast and mountain ash (<italic>Sorbus americanus</italic>) fruit. More research is needed to determine whether variable rates of nest predation by squirrels are the result of a numerical or functional response, or both.Apparent nest success of Rusty Blackbirds was lower in 2012 than in 2011 (59&percnt; and 75&percnt;, respectively), although year effects received only marginal support in our modeling analyses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Matsuoka1">Matsuoka et al. (2010)</xref> reported significant annual variation in nest survival (21&percnt; in 2006, 64&percnt; in 2007 and 2008 combined) of Rusty Blackbirds in Alaska, USA, and attributed 89&percnt; of nest failures to predation. Cyclical fluctuations in the numbers of Rusty Blackbirds migrating through Quebec, Canada, indicate significant annual variation in reproductive success in the eastern boreal forest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Savard1">Savard et al. 2011</xref>). The abundance of migrating Rusty Blackbirds is correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation, as well as with cycles of other boreal species such as the Boreal Owl (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Aegolius funereus</named-content></italic>) and red-backed vole (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Myodes gapperi</named-content></italic>), which suggests that their population may be influenced by complex, climate-driven trophic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Savard1">Savard et al. 2011</xref>).It is unclear why we did not observe red squirrels depredating nests in New Hampshire, but methodological differences may have contributed as we did not deploy cameras on nests in New Hampshire until after eggs had hatched. Therefore, we may have missed nest predation by red squirrels during laying and/or incubation. Alternatively, differences in the forest matrix between the Maine and New Hampshire study sites could have played a role. In New Hampshire, nest stands are discrete patches of young softwoods surrounded by older, hardwood-dominated forests. Some studies have found lower nest predation rates in deciduous forests relative to coniferous forests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Bayne3">Bayne et al. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Sieving1">Sieving and Willson 1998</xref>). Although we did not find strong support for study site differences in nest survival based on our modeling analyses, apparent nest survival was higher in New Hampshire (75&percnt;, <italic>n</italic> &equals; 40) than in Maine (56&percnt;, <italic>n</italic> &equals; 25).Perhaps the greater availability of mature forest in New Hampshire provided more abundant and/or consistent food for squirrels, resulting in fewer foraging forays into the early successional habitats where Rusty Blackbirds nest. We found the landscape to be more homogeneous in Maine, with twice as much relatively young, softwood forest within Rusty Blackbird home ranges as in New Hampshire. It is possible that the relative spatial homogeneity of forests in Maine may have resulted in a higher cumulative density of nests in similar habitats (sensu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Martin2">Martin 1993</xref>) and/or a more constant search image for red squirrels (thereby enhancing learning; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Pelech1">Pelech et al. 2010</xref>), both of which could potentially have led to higher rates of nest predation. Regardless, nest survival models including forest type at the home range scale received little support.Although we did not observe an adverse impact of timber harvesting on Rusty Blackbird nest survival, our results suggest that certain stand treatments and infrastructure associated with harvesting (i.e. roads) could be detrimental. If there is an association between certain predators and roads, then it may be prudent to consider the potential effects of infrastructure associated with harvest operations, rather than focusing on stand treatments exclusively. However, given the ambiguity of our results, as well as those of other studies with regard to road effects, further study of the relationship between roads and the activity of potential nest predators is warranted.Because the daily survival rate of Rusty Blackbird nests increased with increasing basal area, which was composed mostly of trees with DBH &le;4 cm around Rusty Blackbird nests, the practice of precommercial thinning (PCT) could negatively affect Rusty Blackbird nest survival. Unfortunately, because we did not have detailed treatment information for all stands and because of the small number of nests per specific treatment, we were unable to analyze the effects of different treatments separately. It is notable that of the 5 nests that we observed in PCT stands, 3 failed and 1 was partially depredated (although still fledged 1 chick). Although our variable representing harvest history did not come out as a strong predictor of nest survival in our models, the general nature of this term (i.e. including all harvest types) may have obscured some important subtleties related to specific treatment types. Therefore, we interpret significant relationships between nest survival and variables representing vegetation structure (e.g., basal area) as reasonable surrogates for different stand treatments.Precommercial thinning is an increasingly common treatment applied to regenerating conifer stands in the Acadian forests of eastern North America to reduce stocking density and to enhance growth of select crop trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Seymour1">Seymour 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Homyack1">Homyack et al. 2004</xref>). Thinning accelerates the development of mature forest characteristics, such as larger tree diameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-McCormack1">McCormack and Lemin 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Brissette1">Brissette et al. 1999</xref>) and increased overstory complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-McCormack1">McCormack and Lemin 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Homyack1">Homyack et al. 2004</xref>), in younger stands, thereby increasing habitat suitability for squirrels and other small mammals favoring mature forest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Ransome1">Ransome et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Homyack2">Homyack et al. 2005</xref>). Thus, the structural changes resulting from PCT may reduce the quality of Rusty Blackbird nesting habitat by attracting more mammalian predators. We recommend that land managers interested in providing Rusty Blackbird nesting habitat avoid applying PCT in regenerating stands or parts of stands, particularly in or near wetlands. Leaving certain areas &ldquo;overstocked&rdquo; will likely also benefit other songbirds dependent on early successional, coniferous habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Woodcock1">Woodcock et al. 1997</xref>).We suggest that future research efforts be directed toward rigorously investigating the relationships between cone cycles, nest predation, and Rusty Blackbird reproductive success, ideally across large spatial and temporal scales. A better understanding of how Rusty Blackbird demography and population structure are influenced by boreal forest ecology, and how forest management interacts with and influences ecological processes, is especially critical in the face of climate change. Climate regulates cone production in many northern conifers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Owens1">Owens and Blake 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Messaoud1">Messaoud et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Krebs1">Krebs et al. 2014</xref>), and a recent study in the Yukon, Canada, found that red squirrels are producing litters earlier in the spring, likely as a result of warming spring temperatures and increased cone production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-4-609-Reale1">R&eacute;ale et al. 2003</xref>). Given the complex trophic interactions and cycles that characterize northern forests, studies are needed to determine how Rusty Blackbird populations are influenced by the dynamic, changing ecosystem of which they are a part.The authors thank Patti Newell Wohner for much of the data collection in New Hampshire, Luke Powell for offering valuable advice and assistance in the field, and the dedicated and hardworking field assistants in both Maine and New Hampshire: Linnea D'Amico, Eian Prohl, Sara Prussing, Joe Roy, Cindy Ross, and Jesse Cosentino.
