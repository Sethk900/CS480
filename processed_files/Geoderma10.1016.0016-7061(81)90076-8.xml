Spatial dependence and classification of the soil  along a transect in northeast Scotland. Geoderma,26: 63--82.  This paper analyses a problem common to almost all general-purpose soil surveys,  namely how to classify the soil of a region so that each class is both reasonably  homogeneous with respect to soil profile and occurs as reasonably large parcels of land.  A spatial analysis and a classification have been made of the soil along a transect in  northeast Scotland. Semi-variograms of subsoil properties were computed from sample  data at 20-m intervals. They showed spatial dependence extending to about 360 m for  some properties, in particular, colour and pH, and little or no spatial dependence in  others, notably the particle-size fractions and organic-matter content. The form of the  first group of semi-variograms suggested that there were several discontinuities on the  transect, i.e., boundaries between distinct soil types. These were identified by two seg-  mentation techniques, thereby providing a spatial classification. The results were then  compared with an optimal classification of the same data irrespective of po,~ition on the  ground. There was close agreement between the two classifications in some parts of the  transect, particularly where the soil was strongly gleyed. Elsewhere segments contained  mixtures of non-spatial classes.    INTRODUCTION  A problem common to almost all general-purpose soil surveys is to clas-  sify the soil of some region in such a way that each class is both reasonably  homogeneous with respect to the soil profile and occurs in reasonably large  parcels of land. The creation of classes of profile without regard to their  spatial arrangement can lead to such fragmentation of the area that the clas-  sification has no practical value. Equally, a subdivision of the regdon into  large convenient shapes without sufficient regard to the soil does not seem  reasonable. In practice some compromise is usually struck, with soil classes  being recognised on a combination of both soil profile and spatial  considerations.    0016-7061/81/0000--0000/$ 02.50 1981 Elsevier Sci,~.utific Publishing Company    64    The above problem is usually solved intuitively rather than analytically.  However, recent advances in geostatistics provide the means of measuring  spatial dependence and its consequences for classification.  Webster and Cuanalo (1975) adapted time-series methods for this purpose  by recording soil properties at equal intervals along a transect, and then  computing correlograms to express the spatial dependence present. They  showed that most of the variation was due to a combination of dis-  continuities in the rock outcrops {Jurassic sediments) from which the soil  was derived and 'noise', that is variation within the shortest sampling inter-  val. With this in mind, Webster (1973, 1978) developed a method for locat-  ing soil boundaries based cn an interpretation of the correlograms. The  method was tested in the same region of Jurassic rocks in Oxfordshire,  England, and also some 20 km to the south on mainly Pleistocene river ter-  race deposits.  In this paper we extend the investigation to glaciated hard-rock terrain in  northeast Scotland, using the semi-variograms of regionalised variable theory  {Matheron, 1965, 1971) as the principal tool. We also compare a spatial clas-  sification with the result of the more conventional numerical approach that  takes no account of the position of the soil on the ground.    TILLYCORTHIE: THE STUDY TRANSECT    To study the variability of soil within a small area in a limited time it  was decided to use the familiar line-transect technique {i.e., a straight line  laid over a tract of country, along which observations are taken equidistant-  ly). Line transects have the advantage of giving an indication of both the  local and the general variation. The major disadvantage is that the tech-  nique may depend strongly on direction in some areas. The area chosen for  this study was the Universit~ of Aberdeen farms of Tillycorthie and  Thistlyhill, approximately 15 km north of Aberdeen, around 577'N and  29'W.    Geology    The farms lie on the gently rolling topography of the Buchan platform of  northeast Scotland. Generally in this area the bedrock is mica schist  (Dalradian Series of the Highland Schists) with local granitic intrusions. The  underlying rocks were deeply weathered during the Tertiary Period but the  weathering materials have been variously affected by glacial and peri-glacial  erosion and deposition during the Pleistocene Period {FitzPatrick, 1963,  1969). At present on most of the crests, which have been scraped bare of  their weathered rocks, the soil is shallow and underlain by frost-shattered  rock, while solifluction deposits more than 1 m thick, derived from glacial  drift and weathered material, mantle the slopes.    65    Field-work  The transect, 2 km long, was laid across the farms from the northeast of  Thistlyhill Farm, U.K. National Grid Reference NJ91222445, to the south-  west of Tillycorthie Farm, NJ90512258. The position was chosen to em-  brace all slope facets. Pits were dug at 20-m intervals and at each of the  101 sampling points the second horizon was described and sampled for  laboratory analysis.  Laboratory work  The soil-samples were taken to the laboratory where the main and mottle  colours were immediately measured by comparisons with Munsell colour  charts under standard light conditions. The mottle percentage in the  horizcntal plane was also measured by counting grid intersections. The  Munsell colours were then converted into CIELUV co-ordinates as described  in the Appendix. After air-drying, grinding and subsampling using a spin  riffler, the following chemical determinations were made; organic carbon  (Tinsley, 1950), total nitrogen (Bremner, 1965), pH in 0.01M CaC12  (Schofield and Taylor, 1955). A rapid particle-size analysis was carried out  by dry sieving after removing the &lt; 20/~m fraction by sedimentation. A  portion of the 60--100 pm fraction was separated into light arid heavy  minerals by flotation in tribromomethane, and the proportion of the heavy  mineral hypersthene estimated from counts under the microscope.  PRELIMINARY DATA ANALYSIS  "~ansformation to stabilise variance  The data consist of 18 spatial series each of length 101. The series were  individually transformed in order to stabilise their variances. The names of  the variates and the most appropriate transformations are listed in Table I.  Principal component analysis  In order to see the relationships between sampling points the 18 original  variates were transformed to principal components after first standardising  the variates to zero mean and unit variance. Table II lists the first six eigen-  values and corresponding eigen-vectors. This shows that a substantial propor.  tion, some 44%, of the total variance is accounted for by the first two com-  ponents, and that the first component essentially represents colour. A  varimax rotation (Kaiser, 1958) of these components produced no appreci-  able improvement in interpretability.    66  TABLE I  The variates and transformations to stabilise variances  Variate Name                        Unit    Transformation  1      Depth to second horizon       m      reciprocal  2      Main colour L~                %      square root  3      Main colour u~                %      square root  4      Main colour v~'                 %       square root  5      Mottle colour L*               %       square root  6      Mottle colour u*               %       square root  7      Mottle colour v*               %       square root  8      Mottles in horizontal p~ane     %       none  9      &lt; 20 um                       %      logit*  10      20--200 um                   %      none  11      200--2000 ~m                %      logarithm  12      Light minerals in 60--100 um  fraction expressed as a  fraction of whole soil mass   %      square root  13      Heavy minerals in 60-~00 um  fraction expressed a,,; a  fraction of whole soil mass   %      square root  14      Hypersthene in 60--100 ~m     %      square root  15      Organic carbon                %      reciprocal  16      Total nitrogen                 %       reciprocal  17      Organic C/Total N                     reciprocal  18      pH in 0.01M CaCI2             pH     none    ...................................................  ~ logit is In (p/(100- p)} where p is the percentage.

In these the relationship or dependence of the  soil at places a given distance apart is expressed as an autocorrelation. Thus  if a soil property has been measured at n points to give V~Llues x(i), i =  1, 2, ..., n then the sample autoco~relation at some separating distance, or  lag, h can be calculated as:  n-h  r(h) = {1/( n - h)}  ~  {(x(i) - "x)(x(i + h) - x)} Ivar(x)          (1)  i=1  g  where x is the sample mean of the property and var(x) is it:~ variance. The  quantity r(h) estimates p(h), the expected value of the auto.correlation at  lag h.  Autocorrelation analysis depends on there being a constant mean over,  the field of interest and also on a constant and finite variance, i.e. second-  order stationarity. Only in these circumstances is r(h } an unbiased estimator  of p(h). An approach that makes less rigorous assumptions that depend only  on the differences between values is now the basis of geostatistics and uses  the semi-variance as the measure of spatial c ependence. This is half the ex-  pected squared difference between values at places separated by a given lag.  Thus, if 7(h) is the semi-variance at that lag:  7(h) = E[ (x(i) - x(i + h)} 21                      (2)  and is estimated on a transect by:  7(h) = {1/2(n - h)}      x(i) - x(i + h) 2                    (3)  i-1  The assumptions are that the expected value of the difference at distance h  is:  E[x(i)- x(i + h)] =0                         (4)  and its variance is:  var[x(i) - x(i + h)] = 27(h)                        (5)  which must be finite. If the assumption of second-order stationarity holds  then"  ~,(h) = var(x)(1 - p(h)}                          (6)  We believe that this assumption is too rigorous for soil, in particular for  the situation with which we are concerned in this paper, and we therefore    68    prefer to use the semi-variance. Readers can find an extended discussion in  Matheron (loc.cit.) and Journel and Huijbregts (1978) and follow the refer-  ences given there.  Campbell (1978) first used the semi-variance and semi-variograms in soil  studies, and more recently Burgess and Webster (1980a,b) and Hajrasuliha  et al. (1980} have applied this form of analysis to estimation and interpola.  tion in soil mapping. We use it here in a different context.  THE SAMPLE SEMI-VARIOGRAMS    Sample semi-variograms were computed for all the properties measured,  after stabilising their variances by appropriate transformations, as above.  Figs. 1--3 show a selection of the results with semi-variances plotted as  black discs. There seem to be two main types.  )'(h)                           }'(h)  1.5                            oOOooeOeoOoOOo                                                   oo  o (a)                                  (b)        0o%     ee                                    1.0              oee            ee  o  o  1.0                                                            o  o  oo  oo  e                                                      0.5  0.5   .'"                                   0 :~    0000000000000000000000 0000 0  0                 I              1              I              I              I              I                                                            I               1              I              I              I           _1    2.oI  (c)             0"''              (d)        "eo'eeo"  O0     il@                                                                O0                   O@O   eo                         15                oo                                                                                                                                  oo00  0.5                 oo                                            oo       o  %                                    1.0  o                                                                                     o  000   000                            0000                       05   DO000000000         00-0000000  -  O0      0000000000000000                                                             00000    u              oUO  0  0     I    L    I    I    I    I             0     I     I    I    I    I   .I    2O  1.0  o  (e)        .....

Semi-variograms of first six principal components in order from (a) to (f).  smooth curve fitted to the estimates will cut the ordinate at some finite  value, not zero, which by definition the semi-variance must equal at zero  lag. This feature is known as the nugget effect, and the intercept value is  the nugget variance. It represents the unaccountable variation present within  distances less than the sampling interval. The terms derive from gold mining  where the occurrence of a gold nugget in a drill core is a somewhat chance  event. A third and more subtle feature of this group of semi-variograms is a  small break or change of slope at around lag 8. This suggests that there is  variation at two scales.  The second main type of semi-variogram contrasts markedly with the  first, for it consists entirely of fluctuation about the nugget variance. Most    71    of the particle-size fractions vary so in this range as do the carbon and  nitrogen contents and two at least of the six leading principal components,  i.e. 2 and 3. A few properties have semi-variograms that rise steeply over  the first few lags, e.g. the coarse sand fraction {200--2000 um).    INTERPRETATION OF THE SEMI-VARIOGRAMS    Optimal segmentation    There is very little more to say about the second type of semi-variogram.  All the variance occurs within the shortest sampling interval. It is simply  'noise' at our working scale.  The first type shows spatial dependence extending to 360 m to 400 m.  As in the two examples in Oxfordshire it seemed likely to result from dis-  continuities, i.e. soil boundaries, between relatively homogeneous segments  of the transect some 360 m apart. However, the curves in the semi-  variograms as this lag is approached suggest that the boundaries are not at  all evenly spaced. The break at around lag 8, 160 m, suggests that there are  also other boundaries between less contrasting segments.  With this in mind, we sought boundaries using Webster's (1978) and  Hawkins and Merriam's (1974} multivariate segmentation techniques. Both  methods are optimal i~a the sense that they minimise the variance within the  segments they identify. They differ in the distances over which they con-  sider the variance. Hawkins and Merriam's method treats the whole transect  simultaneously, dividing it at places in such a way that the maximum reduc-  tion in variance is achieved. W~':-,~ter's method operates locally and sequen-  tially over a 'window'. At each position on the transect the two halves of  the window are compared and a criterion, which can be either Mahalanobis  D2 or squared Euclidean distance, E2, is calcu][ated. If a soil boundary, in  the sense of a discontinuity or large rate of change relative to that in the  neighbouring parts of the transect, occurs within the window then there will  be a peak in the value of D2 or E2. The posit]~on of the peak indicates the  position of the boundary. The papers referred to give full accounts of the  methods.  Neither method is computationally feasible when there are many variates,  and so in applying the methods we first transformed the data to canonical  variates to concentrate the discriminating power within a few variates, as fol-  lows. The transformation is based on the assumption that the transect can  be divided: by k - 1 boundaries into k relatively homogeneous segments with  a common variance-covariance matrix, ~2, and multivariate normal distribu-  tion. The initial variance stabilising transfc~rmations of the original measure-  ments ensure that the last two conditions of the assumption are reasonable.  And we shall show that the first is entirely satisfied. The p variates  recorded for the jth sampling point, j = 1, 2, ..., n, on the transect are ar-  ranged in a vector, xi. The total sums of squares and product matrix, T, is    72    then simply:  T = (xj - x)(xj - ~)T            (7)  where x is the mean vector for the transect. It estimates (n - 1)~ +  ((k - 1)nB}/k, where B is the variance-covariance matrix of the segment  means. And since n is very much larger than k this is approximately  n(~2 + B). We also consider a matrix, S, of squared successive differences  between sampling points.  n  S =-~ ~d (Xj- Xj_I)(Xj - Xj_I)T                           (8)  j=2  This matrix estimates (n - 1)~2 + kB, and for n &gt;&gt; k is approximately n~2.  The matrices T and S can therefore be used to obtain the desired transfor-  mation to canonical variates.  The eigen-values hi, i = 1, 2, ..., p, of the matrix TS-~ and their as-  sociated vectors ai are found to satisfy"  (T - kiS)ai = 0                               (9)  The vectors are scaled so that (1/n)aiSaiT-- I emd (1/n)aiTaiT = ;~i. The  original p n data matrix X is then transformed by:  Y = AX                              (10)  Those few variates in Y with the largest variances are the ones that  discriminate best between the segments, and are the ones retained: for locat-  ing the segment boundaries.  The upper part of Fig. 4 presents the result of the split moving-window  analysis. There are ten prominent peaks, showing the presence of ten soil  boundaries and giving their positions. The high value near the left-hand  (northern) end of the transect suggests that there is another boundary there.  The same divisions are found by Hawkins and Merriam's maximum level-  variance method, and are shown in the lower part of Fig. 4.  The latter result provides additional insight into the form of the semi-  variograms, from which we inferred only six segments. On the right-hand  side of the figure are given the proportions of variance accounted for by  the segmentation. The first few divisions clearly make big contributions, but  after six boundaries have been inserted the increments to the explained  variance by further segmentation become very small. It seems that there are  major differences across some six of the boundaries. These occur on average  at 360 m intervals, and give rise to the overall shape of the semiovariograms.  There are subsidiary differences, which nevertheless appear as boundaries in  the upper part of Fig. 4, and it seems likely that these give an i:lter-    73  E2  75  5O  0                                                 ,   ',2131, I 5 161, 18191 ,0 1,1 ,2 I  'w              1              J '     "       i  0            20           40           60            80          100  No. of                                                                   % variance  segments                                                             expla ined  2                                                                 t4.5  3                                                                     33.7  ,                                                                  40.7  5                                            o~o                 47.5  6 --                                           ,     -    53.9  7                  ,      .o                 -      e~e-         57.2  8 ue,         o,     -      -o               o~e~o          60.0  9              ,e              o--e  "    o-e  ......  e~o~ 63.3  10 --    ,o ,~          e~o~o    .o-o~-e~o-        66.6  11 ~o              ,      o~o  - e~o--e       ,  -o~o~ 694  12 uo          e~o--o       o~e  -,.o~o-e          -e~o           71.2  13 ~e     o~o~o--o       ome  -    o-o         -o    ..         72.8  14--o~e-.o~o~o--o       e--o  -     o-o  ....  o~o          74.2  15 --o~o-o~o~e--o  ....  o--o-o--e     o-e         --o ,- o~ 75.8  I    ~    I    ~    L    L    I    ,     I    ,    I    ~    I    l    I    i    I    ~   1        .!  0     10    20    30    40    50    60    70    8090          100  Position of segment boundary  Fig. d.

Semi-variograms of residuals  Webster and Cuanalo (1975) showed that most of the spatial dependence  evident on the Sandford transect in north Oxfordshire could be attributed  to abrupt changes in the outcropping rock. They calculated variate means  for each segment of the transect between geological boundaries arid then  computed correlograms afresh on the residuals. In the terminology of time-  series analysis they removed the trend. 'Ihe results showed spatia! de-  pendence extending to a maximum of about 50 m for some variates and  less for others. Webster {1980} has obtained very similar results taking the  optimally located soil boundaries instead of the geological ones.

The soil boundaries identified  by the two segmentation techniques account for all the spatially dependent  variation that can be identified by sampling at 20 m intervals.  COMPARISON OF SPATIAL AND NON-SPATIAL CLASSIFICATIONS  In the preceding sections of this paper we have been concerned with the  spatial relations in the soil at Tillycorthie. We conclude by examining some  of the difficulties that arise when attempts are made to translate the spatial  classification at Tillycorthie into a non-spatial framework, and vice versa.  Similarity relationships using principal components  The similarity relationships among the sampling points can be seen ~o ad-  vantage by plotting the resultant scores of the leading principal components  as scatter diagrams.  Fig. 5 shows the scatter of the sampling points projected into the plane  of the first two components. Each segment is distinguished from the others  by its symbol. Thus all points in the first segment are denoted  those in  the second by a, and so on. In general, sampling points in any one segment  lie close to one another in this projection. For example, all the points in  segment 3 are together in the bottom right quadrant, and those in segment 5  lie top centre of the projection. There are a few segments whose members  are more widely scattered. No segment occupies a compact part of this pro-  jection, however, without some admixture of sampling points from other  segments. The projection cannot be pea~itioned into disjoint parcels corre-  sponding wholly to the segments. And this remains substantially true when  the third component dimension is added. Thus although sampling points in  any one segment are generally similar they are not all as similar to one  another as they are to points in other segments. A classification based solely  on similarity, i.e. without regard to po,~ition on the transec~ would group  points differently.  Optimal non-spatial classification  The last observation is pursued by attempting to compute an optimal cl~-  sification of the sampling points on their measured values alone. The sense  of optimality is the same as before, namely the minimum variance within  classes. We say 'attempting', however, because for as many as 101 individ-  uals it is not possible to be sure that the true global optimum has been  found.  The method used was that embodied in the GENSTAT program (Alvey  et al., 1977; Banfield and Bassill, 1977) with a final refinement of our own,  as follows. For a given number of groups a starting classification was pro-    76    3  \                 \          v    v   Ov -v  \            \  v                 \                 \Q ll        ~tt  vii          \"      l        []   Ai     iA A            II  \  .,., O--                                                #%  E                        i'               &amp;   []     ~  ....  --"          (~  ._~                   '~        i  tti"-2                             /  ,iV &amp;                     /                            Q  V  II     ,/  -3                      /                                        Q  /                    Q     A  0  _,,   (~)      I         A  (ll  i        v                  v(i         (~  i              v                     (i  -s      ,  /     ,          I                     1          ,           ,          ,  -4       -3       -2       -el       0        1        2        3       z,  Principal component 2  Segments:  (1)  e (2)  (3)  (4)  V (5)  V (6)  v (7)  A (8)  &amp; (9)  &amp; (10)  n (11) li (12)  Fig. 5.

The  within-groups sum-of-squares, 88w, of the Euclidean distances (i.e. character,  space distances) between the individual sampling points and their group  centroids was calculated. Points were then reallocated to other groups, one  at a time, and SSw recalculated. If SSw was thereby diminished the re-  allocation was regarded as an improvement and retained, otherwise not.  When no further improvement seemed possible, pairs of points were ex-  changed and the result assessed by the same criterion. Again the exchange  was accepted as an improvement if the resulting SSw was smaller but not  ctherwise. The two modes of improvement were carried out alternately  until no further diminution in SSw seemed possible. Finally Wilks'  criterion, L, was calculated, and an attempt made to reduce it further by re-  allocating any point nearer in the Mahalanobis sense to a class centroid  other than its own. At most three points were re-allocated at this stage for  all the classifications.  A substantial problem in ~:~his form of classification can be choosing the  number of classes.

For Ti]]ycorthie the maximum number of  classes for this comparison is clearly twelve, because twelve segments were  identified. This choice, however, takes no account of similarities between  the soil of different and distant segments; for example, between segments 4  and ll, and between segments 6 and 12. The alternative is to see whether  for any number of groups the actual classes correspond to clusters. If the),  do this represents a 'natural' classification. Otherwise either the number of  groups or some threshold valance must be chosen entirely arbitrarily.  One way of identifying clusters is to examine the scatter diagrams for the  leading few principal components. This is sometimes possible, h,. Fig. 5  most of group A appears as a J~airly distinct cluster on the far left. Group B  might be identified, though with less certainty. A more analytical approach  is that suggested by Marriott (1971) and used by Webster and Burrough  (1972) for soil. It is based on the principle that for disjoint partition of the  character space into any given number of classes Wilks' criterion is least if  classes correspond to clusters and most if clusters are split. Oassification of  an evenly distributed set of individuals will tend togive an intermediate  value of L. For such a distribution the product, g2L, of this value with the  square of the number of groups, g, will tend to fall steadily from 1 as g is    78    increased. For a clustered distribution g2L will fall below the trend when g  clusters are present, and since further subdivision must split at least one  cluster g2L will increase again. So by calculating g2L for each optimum clas-  sification and plotting it against g the most 'natural' number of groups and  classifications can be identified.  Fig. 7 is. the graph of g2L against g for one to twelve classes at  Tillycorthie. It shows clearly the presence of five clusters, and we have  therefore adopted the optimal classification at this level for the final com-  g2t.  1.0 -@    0.1                   @     @  @    @  0.01                                 @  @  0.001   l     ,    ~     i    l     I     l     i     !     i    I'1    I  1         2        3        4        5        Co        7        8        9       10                12  (:J (number of CIosses)  Fig. 7.

The classification is also shown by partition of the  principal component projection in Fig. 5, for which some additional expla-  nation is needed. The first axis represents gleying (see Table II). On the  extreme left there is none- the soil is freely drained; whereas on the far  right the soil is strongly gleyed and by inference poorly drained. The  second axis (Table II) represents particle-size distribution, especially strong-  ly influenced by the fine sand fraction. Soil at the top of the diagram con-  tains much fine sand. That at the bottom is coarser textured, and is in fact  stony and near to the underlying shattered rock. Thus group A is fine  sandy and brown without gley features. Group B is coarse sandy, stony,  and slightly gleyed. Groups C and D are not clearly separated in the projec-  tion shown.

The soil of group D is not only strongly gleyed but  also contains much more silt and clay than that of group C and lies nearer  to the surface (has a thinner A horizon). Group E is anomalous and con-  sists of buried topsoil, i.e. a former A horizon.  Having obtained this classification we can see where the members of the  five classes lie on the transect. Their positions are given in Table V, reading  from left to right along the rows. Two features of the table merit attention.  The first is that there are only five obvious boundaries. They occur im-  mediately after positions 19, 40, 46, 80 and 89. These are all positions    80    found by segmentation. All except that after position 46 mark the limits of  the strongly gleyed soil and are among the five most prominent boundaries  as identified by Hawkins and Merriam's method of segmentation. Segment 8,  with boundaries after positions 54 and 62 is evident when allowance is  made for the anomalous sites with the buried A horizon. But other  boundaries found by segmentation are not evident: segments 1, 2, 7, 9 and  10 contain substantial mixtures of at least two classes, and in some instances  three.  There is thus incompatibility between the optimal segmentation; i.e. the  spatial classificvtion, and the best nonspatial classification that we have been  able to identify. This kind of result has often been regarded as impurity  (Beckett and Webster, 1971); occurrence of types of soil profile in mapping  units dominated and designated as other types. There is more to the in-  compatibility than that, and we explore the result further elsewhere  {Webster and McBratney, 1981).

APPENDIX    A transformation of colour records to three orthogonal linear scales  The colour of the soil is usually recorded using the hue, value and chroma scales, of  the Munsell system. It is often represented with reference to a solid cylinder standing on  its base in which: (1) value, the lightness of the colour, is represented by the vertical  axis of the cylinder; (2) chroma, that is brightness or saturation, is represented hori-  zontally along the radius; and (3) hue, the spectral composition, is represented as an  angle in the horizontal plane.  The scale for hue immediately presents problems for statistical analysis because it is  circular. And while there are unlikely to be serious consequences from treating it as  linear when only a small portion of the scale occurs, such treatment is far from satis-  factory for large ranges of hue. The chroma scale is also less than satisfactory because it    82    TABLE AI  Soil colours in the Munsell notation recorded at Tillycorthie and their equivalents in the  CIE system  Munsell       CIE (1931) co-ordinates  CIELUV (1976)  notation                               co-ordinates  H       V/C  Y       x       y       L*      u*      v*  10R         4/6     20.68      0.411      0.347      52.6         39.9         14.7  5YR        4/6     14.81      0.425      0.369      45.4         34.0         20.0  7.5YR     4/2     12.66      0.378      0.361      42.3         16.0         12.7  5/4     18.88      0.397      0.371      50.6         24.7         20.1  5/6     19.77      0.441       0.394      51.6         38.1         31.5  5/8     20.68      0.469      0.413      52.6         45.4         40.1  6/8     32.43      0.456      0.406      63.7         50.7         44.7  10YR      4/2     13.35      0.374      0.363      43.3         14.4         13.2  5/2     21.62      0.354      0.351       53.7         11.7         10.3  5/4     20.68      0.416      0.382      52.6         31.2         26.1  5/8  20.68   0.465   0.436   52.6    36.8    45.4  6/2     28.90      0.348      0.349      60.7         10.7         10.1  6/4     31.23      0.380      0.382      62.7         17.8         26.8  2.5YR     5/2     20.68      0.347      0.352      52.6           8.0           9.7  5/4     20.68      0.389      0.391       52.6         16.5         26.0  is not constant: it varies somewhat according to the hue and value. These shortcomings  of the Munsell scales can be overcome by transforming the records to CIE (Commission  International d'Eclairage) co-ordinates. Newhall et al. (1943) investigated the relation-  ships between the two schemes, and provided tables and graphs by means of which  values on the Munseil scales could be transformed to CIE co-ordinates as defined at that  time (actually in 1931). 'Table AI lists the CIE (1931) co-ordinates, Y, x and y, for soil  colours recorded at Tillycorthie. Further improvements in the CIE system have been  made in recent years. The most recent recommendation, the CIE 1976 (L*u*v*) colour-  difference formula or CIELUV for short (CIE, 1978), is to make a further transforma-  tion of the CIE 1931 co-ordinates into an approximately uniform colour space.  Let  X - Yx/y,  Z = Y(1-y-x)/y,  u' = 4x/(X + 15Y + 3Z),  and  v' = 9Y/(X+ 15Y+ 3Z).  Then the new co-ordinates are:  L*--- ll6(Y/Yo)'/a - 16  u*-- 13L*(u' - Uo')  and  v*= 13L*(v'- Vo'),  where uo' = 0.2009 and vo' = 0.4710 for diffuse sunlight (standard illuminant C), and  Y0 = 100.  The quantity L* is the lightness of the colour, ,imilar to Munsell value. The other  two co-ordinates may be appreciated by thinking of chroma as (u*~ + v*~)vs. i.e. a  distance in a plane of fixed L*, and hue in terms of the ratio v*/u*.  The final CIELUV co-ordinates of soil colours recorded at Tillycorthie are given in  the right-hand columns of Table AI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 AbstractThis paper analyses a problem common to almost all general-purpose soil surveys, namely how to classify the soil of a region so that each class is both reasonably homogeneous with respect to soil profile and occurs as reasonably large parcels of land. A spatial analysis and a classification have been made of the soil along a transect in northeast Scotland. Semi-variograms of subsoil properties were computed from sample data at 20 m intervals. They showed spatial dependence extending to about 360 m for some properties, in particular, colour and pH, and little or no spatial dependence in others, notably the particle-size fractions and organic-matter content. The form of the first group of semi-variograms suggested that there were several discontinuities on the transect, i.e., boundaries between distinct soil types. These were identified by two segmentation techniques, thereby providing a spatial classification. The results were then compared with an optimal classification of the same data irrespective of position on the ground. There was close agreement between the two classifications in some parts of the transect, particularly where the soil was strongly gleyed. Elsewhere segments contained mixtures of non-spatial classes.
