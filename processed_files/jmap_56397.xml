Metal uptake and transport by Tyaha angustata L. grown on metal contaminated waste amended soil: An implication of phytoremediationTypha angustata L. is a wetland plant commonly found in the marshy land or flood planes of the Ganges riverine system. A field study was taken on T. angustata L. to evaluate the uptake and transport of heavy metals (Mn, Cu, Zn, Cr, Ni and Pb) in different parts of plants grown on waste amended soils in water logged condition for 3 months. T. angustata L. accumulated Mn, Cu, Zn, Cr, Ni and Pb up to 119.21 ± 5.8 µg g− 1, 4.18 ± 0.5 µg g− 1, 5.72 ± 1.1 µg g− 1, 15.4 ± 1.9 µg g− 1, 5.3 ± 0.8 µg g− 1 and 7.21 ± 0.9 µg g− 1 in below ground organ (BL) respectively. Whereas, the maximum metal contents in above ground organ (AG) were 43.86 ± 3.2 µg g− 1, 1.73 ± 0.04 µg g− 1, 2.11 ± 0.07 µg g− 1, 6.31 ± 0.3 µg g− 1, 1.8 ± 0.04 µg g− 1 and 2.75 ± 0.03 µg g− 1 respectively. The plant also retained the tissue nitrogen up to 6.1 ± 0.38% in BL and 9.82 ± 0.54% in AG. It accumulated the maximum concentration of phosphorus 0.25 ± 0.02% in BL and 0.41 ± 0.02% in AG. Metals in both BL and AG were enriched with exposure, but the translocation factor was higher in BL in all amendments. Metal translocation factor was higher in BL/soil than AG/soil to a large extent. The translocation factor of metal from water to below ground organ was higher than water to above ground organ with a maximum value for Cr. There is a strong positive correlation of metal contents in plant tissue with soil organic matter (OM), and phosphorus contents in plant tissue. There is no significant correlation between metal uptake and nitrogen contents in plant tissue. This study reveals that T. angustata L. can be used for remediation of heavy metals containing waste when used in 25% waste amendment.
