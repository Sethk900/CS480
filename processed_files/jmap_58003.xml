Optimization of Water Diversion Based on Reservoir Operating Rules: Analysis of the Biliu River Reservoir, ChinaAbstractInterbasin water-transfer projects are constructed to solve regional water-shortage problems. This study attempts to develop a set of water-diversion strategies to assist in the decision-making process of effectively diverting the water. The reservoir operation rule curves are improved by considering water-diversion rule curves that consist of hydrological-stage and water-level factors. A set of water-diversion strategies consisting of diversion rule curves, diversion flows, and supply rules is then developed to guide the actual water diversion. To minimize total water supply shortages of the urban, agricultural, and ecological water demands, the optimization model is constructed and the variables of diversion strategy are optimized by genetic algorithm. Furthermore, three scenarios including scenarios of no water diversion, water diversion with constant flow, and diversion with strategy are used to better understand the advantages of applying diversion strategies. The authors present a case study for water-diversion operation of the Biliu River reservoir in China. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach will help the reservoirâ€™s managers to effectively divert the water.
