Homing behaviour of rock pool blenny Parablennius parvicornis (Pisces: Blenniidae)The homing ability of the rock pool blenny Parablennius parvicornis was studied at a rocky shore on Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Spain). A total of 140 fish was tagged in five different rock pools and 100 of these were displaced from their original site, during low tide. This blenny species shows great site fidelity and is able to return home from 400Â m away. Results show that homing success mainly depends on the displacement distance and it increases when fish return against the current, whereas sex and fish size have no influence.
