Grazing intensity impacts soil carbon and nitrogen storage of continental steppeRecent studies have underscored the importance of grasslands as potential carbon (C) sinks. We performed a grazing experiment with seven stocking rates (SR0, SR1.5, SR3.0, SR4.5, SR6.0, SR7.5, and SR9.0 for 0, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6.0, 7.5, and 9.0 sheep ha−1, respectively) to investigate the effect of increasing grazing pressure on soil C and nitrogen (N) storage in the temperate grasslands of northern China. The results revealed that C and N storage in both 0–10 cm and 10–30 cm soil layers decreased linearly with increasing stocking rates. Carbon storage in the 0–10 cm soil layer was significantly higher in lightly grazed grasslands than in heavily grazed grasslands after a 5-yr grazing treatment. Our findings suggest an underlying transformation from soil C sequestration under light grazing to C loss under heavy grazing, and that the threshold for this transformation is 4.5 sheep ha−1 (grazing period from June to September). Results confirmed that grasslands used for grazing in northern China have the capacity to sequester C in the soil under appropriate grazing pressure, but that they lose C under heavy grazing. Therefore, appropriate grazer densities will promote soil C sequestration in the grasslands of northern China.
