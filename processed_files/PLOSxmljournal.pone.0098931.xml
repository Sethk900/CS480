Plant species identification: MAHR GIM EM.Rainforests are undergoing severe deforestation and fragmentation worldwide. A huge amount of small forest patches are being created, but their value in conserving biodiversity and forest structure is still controversial. Here, we demonstrate that in a species-rich and moderately-managed Mexican tropical landscape small rainforest patches (&lt;100 ha) can be highly valuable for the conservation of tree diversity and forest structure. These patches showed diverse communities of native plants, including endangered species, and a new record for the country. Although the number of logged trees increased in smaller patches, patch size was a poor indicator of basal area, stem density, number of species, genera and families, and community evenness. Cumulative species-area curves indicated that all patches had a similar contribution to the regional species diversity. This idea also was supported by the fact that patches strongly differed in floristic composition (high β-diversity), independently of patch size. Thus, in agreement with the land-sharing approach, our findings support that small forest patches in moderately-managed landscapes should be included in conservation initiatives to maintain landscape heterogeneity, species diversity, and ecosystem services.The 26 forest patches located in the Marqués de Comillas region and the four reference areas studied within the continuous forest of the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve are also indicated (c).All necessary permits were obtained for this study. It adhered to the laws of the Mexican Government (SEMARNAT, Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales) to sample and collect animals and plants in Lacandona (permit no. SGPA/DGVS/09606). Although our institution, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Mexico (UNAM), does not yet have an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or a similar governing body of ethics, this project was approved by the institutional authorities from UNAM and the Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigación e Innovación Tecnológica (PAPIIT), DGAPA-UNAM (Projects IA-203111, IB-200812 and RR-280812). The owners of the forest patches gave us the permission to perform the research in the study sites.Dot size is directly proportional to site size.

Patches were added from small to large or large to small, respectively, and then corresponding cumulative species counts were obtained.
