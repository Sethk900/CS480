Germination strategies of Strandveld Succulent Karoo plant species for revegetation purposes: III Effect of relative humidity and storage site on seed viabilityChanges in seed viability owing to fluctuations in environmental conditions (temperature and relative humidity) are crucial factors to consider during post-mining revegetation efforts in the Strandveld Succulent Karoo. The effect of relative humidity and storage site on seed viability was investigated in six plant species from the Strandveld Succulent Karoo, South Africa. An increase in relative humidity generally resulted in a decrease in seed viability. High summer temperatures in the field probably hastened the loss of seed viability at a relative humidity of 43%, while exerting only a minimal deteriorative effect on seeds stored at a low relative humidity (7%).
