Taxonomic revision of Bracalba Dodd (Hymenoptera, Platygastridae s.l.), a parasitoid wasp genus endemic to AustraliaAbstract The endemic Australian parasitic wasp genus Bracalba (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae) is revised. Sixteen species are recognized: Bracalba cuneata Dodd, Bracalba laminata Dodd and Bracalba nigrescens (Dodd) are redescribed and thirteen new species are recognized; Bracalba clavata Burks, sp. n., Bracalba globosa Burks, sp. n., Bracalba hesperia Burks, sp. n., Bracalba intermedia Burks, sp. n., Bracalba magnirubra Burks, sp. n., Bracalba parvirubra Burks, sp. n., Bracalba pinnula Burks, sp. n., Bracalba plana Burks, sp. n., Bracalba propodealis Burks, sp. n., Bracalba sculptifrons Burks, sp. n., Bracalba sparsa Burks, sp. n., Bracalba tricorata Burks, sp. n., and Bracalba tridentata Burks, sp. n. The genus is found continent-wide but mostly south of the Tropic of Capricorn, and with the highest species diversity occurring in the Pilbara and south-western regions of Western Australia. The hosts of Bracalba are unknown but specimens reared from eggs confirm that the genus is associated with orthopteran hosts. A preliminary phylogeny of species did not indicate that species groups were monophyletic, but they are retained despite paraphyly because they are convenient for specimen identification.
