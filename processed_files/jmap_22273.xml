(Brazil), Agra grace sp. n. (Ecuador,Perú), Agra max sp. n. (Brazil), Agra minasianus sp. n. (Brazil), Agra notpusilla sp. n. (Brazil), Agra pseudopusilla sp. n. (Brazil); piranha group - Agra ce sp. n. (Perú), Agra risseri sp. n. (Bolivia,Brazil), Agra maia sp. n. (Bolivia), Agra piranha sp. n. (Ecuador); Agra tiputini sp. n. (Ecuador).
