Solitary spawning revealed – an in situ observation of spawning behaviour of Doryteuthis (Amerigo) gahi (d'Orbigny, 1835 in 1834–1847) (Cephalopoda: Loliginidae) in the Falkland IslandsA unique observation was made of the cold water squid Doryteuthis gahi spawning in Patagonian shelf waters near the Falkland Islands, South Atlantic. This represents the first recorded observation of spawning behaviour for this species. In contrast to other loliginids, which spawn in large mixed-sex aggregations, a solitary female was observed adding a single egg capsule to an existing egg mass on a kelp stipe, (Lessonia trabeculata). If this behaviour is characteristic for this species then it represents a departure from normal loliginid spawning behaviour and is in agreement with the observed absence of D. gahi aggregations over spawning grounds.
