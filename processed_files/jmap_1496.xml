Rethinking Avian Response to Tamarix on the Lower Colorado River: A Threshold Hypothesis.Many of the world's large river systems have been greatly altered in the past century due to river regulation, agriculture, and invasion of introduced <em>Tamarix </em>spp. (saltcedar, tamarisk). These riverine ecosystems are known to provide important habitat for avian communities, but information on responses of birds to differing levels of <em>Tamarix </em>is not known. Past research on birds along the Colorado River has shown that avian abundance in general is greater in native than in non-native habitat. In this article, we address habitat restoration on the lower Colorado River by comparing abundance and diversity of avian communities at a matrix of different amounts of native and non-native habitats at National Wildlife Refuges in Arizona. Two major patterns emerged from this study: (1) Not all bird species responded to <em>Tamarix </em>in a similar fashion, and for many bird species, abundance was highest at intermediate <em>Tamarix </em>levels (40-60%), suggesting a response threshold. (2) In <em>Tamarix</em>-dominated habitats, the greatest increase in bird abundance occurred when small amounts of native vegetation were present as a component of that habitat. In fact, <em>Tamarix </em>was the best vegetation predictor of avian abundance when compared to vegetation density and canopy cover. Our results suggest that to positively benefit avian abundance and diversity, one cost-effective way to rehabilitate larger monoculture <em>Tamarix </em>stands would be to add relatively low levels of native vegetation (&sim;20-40%) within homogenous <em>Tamarix </em>habitat. In addition, this could be much more cost effective and feasible than attempting to replace all <em>Tamarix </em>with native vegetation.
