Effect of mineral oil and hydrogen cyanamide concentration on dormancy breaking in ‘Golden Delicious’ apple treesSouth African production areas receive insufficient winter chilling for apple production, necessitating the use of artificial means to break dormancy. Hydrogen cyanamide (HC) alone or in combination with mineral oil (oil) is used as a rest-breaking agent in many deciduous species. The effect of different concentrations of HC and oil on budburst, yield, fruit quality and vegetative growth of mature ‘Golden Delicious’ apple trees were evaluated; the objective was to determine the presence of interaction between the rest-breaking effect of HC and oil when combined at varied concentrations, and to determine appropriate concentrations of HC and oil, to enhance bud- burst, yield and fruit quality. Three trials were conducted in the Elgin valley (34 °S, 300 m) of the Western Cape, South Africa, in 1999 and 2000. The first trial evaluated four concentrations (0, 0.5, 1 and 2%) of Dormex® (hydrogen cyanamide 520 g-L−1) in combination with four concentrations of mineral oil (0, 1, 2, and 4%). The second trial used three concentrations (1, 2 and 4%) of Dormex® in combination with three concentrations of mineral oil (1, 2, 4%), plus an unsprayed control, and a treatment of 6% of DNOC Winter Oil®. The third trial included five treatments: 0.5% Dormex® + 3% oil, 1 % Dormex® + 4% oil, 6% DNOC Winter Oil®, 6% oil and a non-sprayed control. All of the treatments were applied at the first visible signs of budburst. No synergistic effect was observed between oil and HC. Mineral oil at 4% plus 1 to 2% Dormex® were sufficient to break dormancy. Dormex® at 4% (2.08% HC) reduced fruit set and yield.
