A comparison of the bird community of creosote bush scrub during two consecutive summers in the muncipality of Garcia, Nuevo Leon, MexicoThis study examined the avifauna of a creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) community in the municipality of Garcia, Nuevo Leon, during the summers of 1995 and 1996. Based on foraging strategies, the 37 species (1995=29; 1996=31) of insectivorous species observed were grouped into seven functional groups (or guilds), which were Subdivided into 12 Subgroups. Nine functional subgroups were observed during the summer of 1995 and 12 Subgroups observed during 1996. While this diversity of insectivorous foraging strategies was found to be high in this area of the Chihuahuan Desert, the exact nature of the differences observed between 1995 and 1996 remains unclear. It appears to be dependent upon variation in the productivity of the desert ecosystem.
