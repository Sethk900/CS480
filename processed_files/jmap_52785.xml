Short-term responses of soil nutrients and corn yield to tillage and organic amendmentField experiments were conducted in 2010 and 2011 at the Agricultural College of Shiraz University to evaluate the effects of cattle manure and nitrogen (N) fertilizers on soil properties such as soil organic carbon (SOC), soil organic nitrogen (SON), soil electrical conductivity, soil pH and corn yield under two tillage systems. Treatments included tillage systems in two levels as conventional tillage and reduced tillage as subplots, cattle manure (0, 25 and 50 tons ha−1) and N fertilizer (0, 125 and 250 kg N ha−1) as sub-subplots. Results showed that SOC and SON were significantly affected by tillage system in both years of the experiment. SOC and SON were higher in reduced tillage compared to conventional tillage. Tillage system had no significant effect on grain yield, plant height and 1000 seed weight. Increased cattle manure rates at 25 and 50 tons ha−1 increased grain yield by 27% and 38%, respectively, in 2010 and 25% and 25% in 2011. The results showed that application of cattle manure combined with N fertilizer might be an efficient management to increase soil productivity in southern Iran, in soils with poor organic content. Additionally, reduced tillage showed to be an efficient method to increase soil organic matter.
