It summarizes decisions made between May 15, 2014, and April 15, 2015, by the AOU's Committee on Classification and Nomenclature&mdash;North and Middle America. The Committee has continued to operate in the manner outlined in the 42nd Supplement ( AOU 2000 ).  Changes in this supplement include the following: (1) seven species ( Alopochen aegyptiaca ,   Phoebastria irrorata  ,  Pterodroma madeira ,  Syrigma sibilatrix ,  Patagioenas goodsoni ,  Campylorhynchus griseus , and   Phoenicurus phoenicurus  ) are added to the main list on the basis of new distributional information, including two species transferred from the Appendix; (2) 11 species ( Pterodroma heraldica ,  Puffinus newelli ,  Phaethornis mexicanus ,  Calliphlox lyrura ,  Himatione fraithii ,  Hemignathus hanapepe ,  H. affinis ,  Akialoa stejnegeri ,  A. lanaiensis ,  Loxops wolstenholmei , and  L. ochraceus ) are added to the main list due to splits from species already on the list; (3) one species name is changed (to  Cranioleuca dissita ) because of a split from an extralimital species; (4) the distributional statement of one species (  Stercorarius skua  ) is changed because of a split from an extralimital species; (5) the distributional statements and English names of four species ( Pterodroma arminjoniana ,  Hemignathus lucidus ,  Akialoa ellisiana , and  Loxops coccineus ) and the distributional statements of four others ( Puffinus auricularis ,   Phaethornis longirostris  ,  Calliphlox evelynae , and   Himatione sanguinea  ) are changed as a result of taxonomic changes; (6) the scientific names of two species ( Leptotila cassinii  and  Amazilia saucerottei ) are corrected on the basis of evidence in their original descriptions; (7) the scientific names of two species ( Hemignathus wilsoni  and  Chlorodrepanis stejnegeri ) are changed following changes in generic assignment that affected the priority of their species names; (8) seven genera ( Rupornis ,  Geranoaetus ,  Cryptopipo ,  Akialoa ,  Chlorodrepanis ,  Viridonia , and  Spizelloides ) are added as a result of splits from other genera, resulting in changes to 10 scientific names ( Rupornis magnirostris ,  Geranoaetus albicaudatus ,  Cryptopipo holochlora ,  Akialoa obscura ,  A. ellisiana ,  Chlorodrepanis virens ,   C. flava  ,  C. stejnegeri ,  Viridonia sagittirostris , and  Spizelloides arborea ); (9) one genus ( Vestiaria ) is lost by merger (into  Drepanis ) and the scientific name of one species ( D. coccinea ) is thereby changed; (10) the citation for one species ( Pterodroma solandri ) is corrected; and (11) two species ( Anthropoides virgo  and  Grus monacha ) are added to the Appendix. In addition, the English name of one species is transferred to another scientific name in the aftermath of a taxonomic change: Thus, Herald Petrel is now the English name for  Pterodroma heraldica  rather than for  P. arminjoniana .  One new subfamily of Falconiformes is added and two subfamilies are deleted, one new family and three new subfamilies of Psittaciformes are added and two subfamilies are deleted, and one new subfamily is added to the Pipridae. New linear sequences are adopted for genera in the family Thraupidae and in the Hawaiian honeycreepers (Carduelinae, in part), and for species in the  Buteo  group (Accipitridae, in part) and in the genera  Ramphocelus  and  Sporophila , all due to new phylogenetic data. The family placements of 22 genera ( Volatinia ,  Sporophila ,  Melopyrrha ,  Tiaris ,  Loxipasser ,  Loxigilla ,  Euneornis ,  Melanospiza ,  Pinaroloxias ,  Haplospiza ,  Acanthidops ,  Diglossa ,  Sicalis ,  Emberizoides ,  Saltator ,  Coereba ,  Nesospingus ,  Phaenicophilus ,  Calyptophilus ,  Rhodinocichla ,  Mitrospingus , and  Spindalis ) are changed on the basis of new information on their phylogenetic relationships.  Literature that provides the basis for the Committee's decisions is cited at the end of this supplement, and citations not already in the Literature Cited of the 7th edition (with supplements) become additions to it. A list of the bird species known from the AOU  Check-list  area can be found at  http://checklist.aou.org/taxa .  The following changes to the 7th edition (page numbers refer thereto) and its supplements result from the Committee's actions:  pp. xvii&ndash;liv.

After the account for   Phoebastria nigripes  , insert the following new species account:    Diomedea irrorata   Salvin, 1883, Proc. Zool. Soc. London, p. 430. (Callao Bay, Peru.)  Pelagic Waters; breeds on islands.   Breeds  on Hood Island (Gal&aacute;pagos Islands) and on Isla de la Plata off Ecuador.   Ranges  at sea near the coasts of Ecuador and Peru.  Accidental in Costa Rica (Cabo Blanco, Puntarenas, 9 January 2014; photos;  Obando-Calder&oacute;n et al. 2014 ). Sight reports from Panama, west of Pi&ntilde;as Bay, Dari&eacute;n, 26 February 1941 ( Ridgely 1976 ), and southwest of the Pearl Islands, 27 September 1964 ( Ridgely and Gwynne 1989 ).  Also known as Galapagos Albatross.  p. 13. The citation for  Pterodroma solandri , which was transferred from the Appendix to the main list in  Chesser et al. (2013) , is corrected following  McAllan (2004)  to:   Procellaria Solandri  Gould, 1844, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist. 13:363. (Bass's Straits &equals; Bass Strait.)  p. 13.  Pterodroma heraldica  is treated as a species separate from  P. arminjoniana . In the species account for  P. arminjoniana , change the English name to Trindade Petrel, and change the distributional statement and Notes to:   Breeds  on islands in the South Atlantic (Trindade, Martin Vas Rocks) and Indian Ocean (Round Island off Mauritius).   Ranges  at sea generally in the South Atlantic near the breeding grounds and into the subtropical North Atlantic, regularly off North Carolina ( Howell 2012 ).  Casual or accidental from New York (near Ithaca;  Allen 1934 ) south to Virginia (including inland records), in Puerto Rico (Cayo Lobito, Culebra National Wildlife Refuge;  Gochfeld et al. 1988 ), northeast of the Lesser Antilles (lat. 21&deg;51&prime;N, long. 43&deg;35&prime;W), and in England.  Formerly considered conspecific with  P. heraldica  and   P. atrata   Mathews, 1912 &lsqb;Henderson Petrel&rsqb;, but the three are treated as separate species on the basis of assortative mating on islands where they breed in sympatry ( Brooke and Rowe 1996 ; but see  Brown et al. &lsqb;2010&rsqb;  for hybridization in secondary contact on Round Island).  After the species account for  P. arminjoniana , insert the following new account:   Oestrelata heraldica  Salvin, 1888, Ibis, p. 357. (Chesterfield Islands, western Pacific.)  Pelagic Waters; nests on islands on bare rock under overhanging ledges or plants.   Breeds  on islands in the tropical South Pacific.   Ranges  at sea in the South Pacific near the breeding grounds.  Accidental in the Hawaiian Islands (French Frigate Shoals, 14 March 1968;  Amerson 1971 :125), with additional sight reports near Clipperton Island and north to the Revillagigedo Islands ( Howell and Webb 1995 ).  See Notes under  Pterodroma arminjoniana .  p. 16. After the species account for  Pterodroma feae , insert the following new account:   Pterodroma mollis madeira  Mathews, 1934, Bull. Brit. Ornithol. Club 54:179. (Madeira.)  Pelagic Waters; nests in burrows at highest elevations on Madeira.   Breeds  on Madeira, where critically endangered.   Ranges  at sea in waters around Madeira, also recorded around the Azores. Geolocator data from  Zino et al. (2011)  showed birds ranging widely in the northeastern Atlantic during the breeding season; during the nonbreeding season they were mostly found off western Africa, along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to St. Helena, and off Brazil.  Accidental off North Carolina (Hatteras, 16 September 1995; photos;  Howell 2012 ,  Flood and Fisher 2013 ).  See Notes under  Pterodroma feae .  p. 21.  Puffinus newelli  is considered a species separate from  P. auricularis . In the species account for  P. auricularis , replace the distributional statement and existing Notes with the following:   Breeds  in the Revillagigedo Islands (Socorro and, at least formerly, Clarion and San Benedicto), off western Mexico.   Ranges  at sea from Baja California south to Clipperton Island, west to long. ~121&deg;W, and along the coast of Mexico south to Oaxaca; sight reports from California and from Oaxaca southward require confirmation.  Formerly considered conspecific with  P. newelli , but treated as a separate species on the basis of differences in plumage ( Howell et al. 1994 ), morphology and breeding chronology ( Ainley et al. 1997 ), and feeding ecology ( Spear et al. 1995 ) comparable to or greater than the differences among other valid species of small shearwater (and despite apparent similarity in mitochondrial DNA;  Mart&iacute;nez-G&oacute;mez et al. 2015 ).  After the species account for  Puffinus auricularis , insert the following new account:   Puffinus newelli  Henshaw, 1900, Auk 17:246. (Waihee Valley, Ulani &equals; Maui.)  Pelagic Waters; nests in burrows on oceanic islands.   Breeds  in the Hawaiian Islands on Kauai (possibly also on other main islands).   Ranges  at sea primarily near the Hawaiian Islands.  Accidental in the Marianas, American Samoa, and California (Del Mar, San Diego County, 1 August 2007; specimen;  Unitt et al. 2009 ).  The relationship of  newelli  to the extralimital  P. myrtae  Bourne, 1959 &lsqb;Rapa Shearwater&rsqb; is unresolved, and we tentatively consider them separate species pending additional data. See Notes under  P. auricularis .  p. 41. After the species account for   Mesophoyx intermedia  , insert the following heading and new account:   Syrigma  Ridgway, 1878, Bull. U.S. Geol. Geogr. Surv. Territories, 4, pp. 224, 247. Type, by original designation,  Ardea sibilatrix  Temminck.   Ardea sibilatrix  Temminck, 1824, Planches Color., livr. 46, pl. 271. (Brazil and Paraguay.)  Low Seasonally Wet Grasslands, Freshwater Marshes, Pastures/Agricultural Lands.  Orinoco basin and llanos of Colombia and Venezuela and disjunctly from northern Bolivia east to southeastern Brazil and south to Buenos Aires Province, Argentina.  Accidental or casual in Panama (near Portobelo, Col&oacute;n, 27 February 2010, photos; near Chepo, eastern Panam&aacute; province, 11 July 2013 and probably the same bird intermittently to 11 October 2014, photos, North American Birds 67:256&ndash;258; near Gorgona, western Panam&aacute; province, 15 July 2014, intermittently to at least 13 January 2015, photos; and near El Rinc&oacute;n, Herrera, 20 July 2014, photos).  p. 61. After the species account for  Neochen jubata , insert the following heading and new account:   Alopochen  Stejneger, 1885, in Kingsley, Standard Nat. Hist., 4, p. 141. Type, by subsequent designation (Oberholser, 1918, Journ. Washington Acad. Sci. 8:572),  Anas aegyptiaca  Linnaeus.    Alopochen aegyptiaca   (Linnaeus). Egyptian Goose.  &emsp; Anas aegyptiaca  Linnaeus, 1766, Syst. Nat., ed. 12, 1:197. (Egypt.)  In subtropical Africa, inland freshwater rivers and near lakes and pools; in Florida and Europe, where introduced, managed habitats with aquatic features (parks, golf courses, etc.).   Resident  in Africa south of the Sahara, and north along the Nile to about Aswan Dam, Egypt. Some northward movement during the wet season. Formerly, until early 18th century, found north to the Danube Valley in southern Hungary and Romania.  Casual north to Israel, Cyprus, Malta, and the Red Sea coast of Arabia.  Introduced in Martin County, Florida, in 1993&ndash;1994, and now established in southeast Florida (~1,200 birds as of 2012&ndash;2013;  Pranty and Ponzo 2014 ). A small population is present in Orange County, California, and scattered individuals have been noted elsewhere in North America. Also introduced and established in parts of western Europe, notably Great Britain and The Netherlands.  pp. 96&ndash;103. Phylogenetic analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences ( Raposo do Amaral et al. 2009 ) has shown that the generic limits and linear sequence of species currently placed in the genera  Morphnarchus ,  Parabuteo ,  Pseudastur ,  Leucopternis , and  Buteo  do not accurately reflect their evolutionary relationships. Their findings result in the following changes:  After the account for  Morphnarchus princeps , insert the following heading:   Rupornis  Kaup, 1844, Class. S&auml;ugethiere V&ouml;gel, p. 120. Type, by monotypy,  Falco magnirostris  Gmelin.  &emsp;Change   Buteo magnirostris   (Gmelin) to   Rupornis magnirostris   (Gmelin), place the account for this species under the heading and citation for  Rupornis , and substitute the following for the Notes at the end of the species account:  Formerly placed in the genus  Buteo , but genetic data ( Raposo do Amaral et al. 2009 ) indicate that  R. magnirostris  is sister to all other species in the  Buteo  group other than  Morphnarchus princeps , and not closely related to true  Buteo .  After the account for   Parabuteo unicinctus  , insert the following heading:   Geranoaetus  Kaup, 1844, Class. S&auml;ugethiere V&ouml;gel, p. 122. Type, by monotypy,  Falco aguja  Temminck &equals;  Spizaetus melanoleucus  Vieillot.  &emsp;Change   Buteo albicaudatus   Vieillot to   Geranoaetus albicaudatus   (Vieillot), place the account for this species under the heading and citation for  Geranoaetus , and insert the following Notes at the end of the species account:  Formerly placed in the genus  Buteo , but genetic data ( Raposo do Amaral et al. 2009 ) indicate that this species forms a clade with extralimital species  Geranoaetus melanoleucus  (Vieillot, 1819) &lsqb;Black-chested Buzzard-Eagle&rsqb; and Appendix species  G . (formerly  Buteo )  polyosoma  (Quoy and Gaimard, 1824) &lsqb;Variable Hawk&rsqb;.  Rearrange the sequence of species from  Morphnarchus princeps  to   Buteo lagopus   to:   Morphnarchus princeps    Rupornis magnirostris     Parabuteo unicinctus     Geranoaetus albicaudatus    Pseudastur albicollis    Leucopternis semiplumbeus    Buteo plagiatus    Buteo nitidus     Buteo lineatus     Buteo ridgwayi     Buteo platypterus     Buteo solitarius    Buteo brachyurus     Buteo swainsoni     Buteo albonotatus     Buteo jamaicensis      Buteo lagopus      Buteo regalis    Add the following Notes under the heading Genus   BUTEOGALLUS   Lesson (p. 97): Linear sequence of genera from  Buteogallus  through  Buteo  follows  Raposo et al. (2009) .  pp. 107&ndash;111. Phylogenetic analysis of syringeal morphological characters and mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences ( Griffiths 1999 ,  Griffiths et al. 2004 ,  Fuchs et al. 2012 ) indicate that our current subfamily classification of the Falconiformes does not accurately reflect their evolutionary relationships. Their findings result in the following changes:  Delete the headings Subfamily MICRASTURINAE: Forest-Falcons, Subfamily CARACARINAE: Caracaras, Tribe Herpetotherini: Laughing Falcons, and Tribe Falconini: True Falcons.  Delete the existing Notes under the heading Family  FALCONIDAE  and insert the following:  Subfamily arrangement follows  Griffiths (1999) ,  Griffiths et al. (2004) , and  Fuchs et al. (2012) .  After the heading and Notes for Family  FALCONIDAE : Caracaras and Falcons, insert the following new heading:  Subfamily HERPETOTHERINAE: Laughing Falcon and Forest-Falcons  Move the heading and citation for Genus   HERPETOTHERES   Vieillot and the species account for   Herpetotheres cachinnans   to follow this heading.  Change the heading Subfamily FALCONINAE: Falcons to Subfamily FALCONINAE: Caracaras and Falcons, and move this heading to follow the species account for  Micrastur semitorquatus .  p. 181.  Stercorarius antarcticus  is considered a species separate from   S. skua  . Replace the distributional statement and Notes in the species account for   S. skua   with the following:   Breeds  in Iceland, the Faeroe, Shetland and Orkney islands, locally on the northern Scotland mainland, Svelbard, Norway, and Kola Peninsula, Russia.   Winters  at sea in the eastern North Atlantic, from lat. 60&deg;N south to the Tropic of Cancer, regularly on the Newfoundland Banks and off the coast from Nova Scotia to North Carolina, and rarely to the Canary Islands, the Mediterranean Sea, and off northeastern South America (Guyana, French Guiana, and Brazil).  Accidental in Belize (Ambergris Cay), Guyana, Novaya Zemlya, and continental Europe.  Formerly considered conspecific with   S. antarcticus   (including  S. lonnbergi ), but treated as a separate species on the basis of phenotypic differences commensurate with or greater than those found in reproductively isolated sympatric congeners in the Southern Hemisphere ( Furness 1996 ).  p. 221. After the species account for  Patagioenas nigrirostris , insert the following new account:    Patagioenas goodsoni   (Hartert). Dusky Pigeon.   Columba goodsoni  Hartert, 1902, Bull. Brit. Ornithol. Club 12:42. (San Javier, Pambilar, and Carondelet, n.w. Ecuador &equals; Pambila, Ecuador.)  Tropical Lowland Evergreen Forest, Montane Evergreen Forest (0&ndash;1,000 m).

See comments under  P. nigrirostris .  p. 229. The name  Leptotila cassini  is corrected to  Leptotila cassinii , in accordance with the spelling of the name in the original description ( Lawrence 1867 ),  contra   Ridgway (1916) ,  Peters (1937) , and  Sibley and Monroe (1990) .  pp. 232&ndash;245. Molecular, paleontological, and morphological evidence (summarized in  Joseph et al. 2012 ) indicate that our current family and subfamily classification of the Psittaciformes does not accurately reflect their evolutionary relationships. Their findings result in the following changes:  Delete the existing Notes under the heading Order  PSITTACIFORMES : Parrots, transfer the existing Notes for Family PSITTACIDAE: Lories, Parakeets, Macaws, and Parrots to Order  PSITTACIFORMES : Parrots, and add the following to the end of these newly added Notes: Family and subfamily arrangement follows  Joseph et al. (2012) .  Change the heading Family  PSITTACIDAE : Lories, Parakeets, Macaws, and Parrots to:    Move the heading Subfamily ARINAE: New World Parakeets, Macaws, and Parrots and its included genera and species to follow this family heading.  Delete the headings Subfamily PLATYCERCINAE: Australian Parrots and Rosellas and Subfamily PSITTACINAE: Typical Parrots.  After the species account for  Amazona imperialis , insert the following new headings:  Family  PSITTACULIDAE : Lories, Lovebirds, and Indomalayan and Papua-Australian Parrots  Subfamily PSITTACULINAE: Indomalayan and Papua-Australian Parrots  Move the heading and citation for Genus   PSITTACULA   Cuvier and the species account for   Psittacula krameri   to follow this heading.  After the species account for  Psittacula krameri , insert the following new heading:  Subfamily AGAPORNITHINAE: Lovebirds and Hanging-Parrots  Move the heading and citation for Genus   AGAPORNIS   Selby and the species account for   Agapornis roseicollis   to follow this heading.  After the species account for  Agapornis roseicollis , insert the following new heading:  Subfamily LORIINAE: Lories and Allies  Move the heading and citation for Genus   MELOPSITTACUS   Selby and the species account for    Melopsittacus undulatus    to follow this heading.  p. 283.  Phaethornis mexicanus  is treated as a species separate from   P. longirostris  . In the species account for   P. longirostris  , change the distributional statement and Notes to:   Resident  &lsqb; longirostris  group&rsqb; on the Gulf-Caribbean slope from Veracruz, Tabasco, northern Oaxaca, and northern Chiapas south through Central America to Nicaragua, on both slopes of Costa Rica and Panama, and in northern Colombia and northwestern Venezuela; and &lsqb; baroni  group&rsqb; in South America west of the Andes in western Ecuador and northwestern Peru.  Groups:   P. longirostris   and  P. baroni  Hartert, 1897 &lsqb;Hartert's Hermit&rsqb;. Formerly considered conspecific with extralimital  P. superciliosus  (Linnaeus, 1766) &lsqb;Long-tailed Hermit&rsqb;, but separated ( Banks et al. 2002 ) largely on morphological grounds. See Notes under   P. mexicanus  .  Before the species account for   P. longirostris  , insert the following new account:    Phaethornis mexicanus   Hartert. Mexican Hermit.   Pha&euml;thornis mexicanus  Hartert, 1897, Ibis, p. 425. (Dos Arroyos, near Chilpancingo, Guerrero.)  Tropical Lowland Evergreen Forest, Montane Evergreen Forest (100&ndash;1,900 m; Tropical and Subtropical zones).   Resident  &lsqb; griseoventer  group&rsqb; in western Mexico from west-central Nayarit (near Tepic and San Blas) south to Jalisco (Sierra de Autl&aacute;n, Mineral San Sebastian) and Colima (Cerro Grande); and &lsqb; mexicanus  group&rsqb; in Guerrero and western Oaxaca.  Groups:  P. griseoventer  Phillips, 1962 &lsqb;Jalisco Hermit&rsqb; and   P. mexicanus  . Formerly considered conspecific with   P. longirostris  , but treated as a separate species on the basis of differences in vocalizations, behavior, genetics, and morphology ( Arbel&aacute;ez-Cort&eacute;s and Navarro-Sig&uuml;enza 2013 ,  Howell 2013 ,  McGuire et al. 2014 ).  p. 299. The name  Amazilia saucerrottei  is corrected to  Amazilia saucerottei . The name in the original description ( saucerrottei ) was a misspelling of Saucerotte, the person for whom the species was named ( Delattre and Bourcier 1846 ). This inadvertent error must be corrected under the rules of the  Code of Zoological Nomenclature  ( International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature 1999 , Article 32.5.1).  p. 307.  Calliphlox lyrura  is treated as a species separate from  C. evelynae . In the species account for  C. evelynae , change the habitat and distributional statements and Notes to:  Pine Forest, Second-growth Scrub, Tropical Lowland Evergreen Forest Edge, and Arid Lowland Scrub.   Resident  throughout the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos, except Great and Little Inagua.  Casual in southern Florida (Lantana, Homestead, Miami area).  Sometimes placed in  Philodice  or  Nesophlox  ( Ridgway 1910 ) or merged into  Calothorax  ( Howell 2002 ). Formerly considered conspecific with  C. lyrura , but treated as a separate species (as in  Ridgway 1910 ) on the basis of differences in calls, songs, mechanical sounds, morphology, and genetics ( Feo et al. 2015 ). English names for this species and for  C. lyrura  follow  Ridgway (1910)  as a temporary measure, pending a family-wide revision of English group names based on a complete phylogeny of the Trochilidae.  After the species account for  C. evelynae , insert the following new account:    Calliphlox lyrura   (Gould). Inagua Woodstar.   Doricha lyrura  Gould, 1869, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist. 4:108&ndash;112. (Matthew Town, Great Inagua, Bahamas.)  Second-growth Scrub, Riparian Thickets, and Arid Lowland Scrub.   Resident  on islands of Great and Little Inagua (Bahamas).  Also called Lyre-tailed Hummingbird ( Cory 1880 ), Inaguan Hummingbird, or Inagua Lyretail ( Feo et al. 2015 ). See Notes under  C. evelynae .  p. 349.  Cranioleuca dissita  is treated as a species separate from  C. vulpina . Remove the species account for  C. vulpina  and replace it with the following new account:    Cranioleuca dissita   Wetmore. Coiba Spinetail.   Cranioleuca vulpina dissita  Wetmore, 1957, Smithsonian Misc. Coll. 134:55. (Isla Coiba, Panama.)  Tropical Deciduous Forest.   Resident  on Isla Coiba, Panama.  Formerly considered conspecific with  C. vulpina  (Pelzeln, 1856) &lsqb;Rusty-backed Spinetail&rsqb;, but treated as separate on the basis of differences in vocalizations, genetics, and behavior ( Ridgely and Gwynne 1989 ,  Derryberry et al. 2011 ).  pp. 423&ndash;426. Phylogenetic analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences ( Ohlson et al. 2013 ) has shown that the classification, generic limits, and linear sequence of genera in the family Pipridae do not accurately reflect their evolutionary relationships. Their findings result in the following changes:  Delete the existing Notes under the heading Family  PIPRIDAE : Manakins and insert the following:  Linear sequence of genera and species follows  R&ecirc;go et al. (2007) ,  Tello et al. (2009) ,  McKay et al. (2010) , and  Ohlson et al. (2013) .  After the heading Family  PIPRIDAE : Manakins, insert the following new heading:  Subfamily PIPRINAE: Typical Manakins  After the species account for   Chiroxiphia linearis  , replace the heading Genus   XENOPIPO   Cabanis and its citation and Notes with the following:  Genus   CRYPTOPIPO   Ohlson et al.   Cryptopipo   Ohlson, Fjelds&aring; and Ericson, 2013 , Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 69:802. Type, by original designation,  Chloropipo holochlora  Sclater.  Change   Xenopipo holochlora   (Sclater) to   Cryptopipo holochlora   (Sclater), place the account for this species under the heading and citation for  Cryptopipo , and replace the existing Notes with the following:  Formerly placed in the genus  Xenopipo , but genetic data ( Ohlson et al. 2013 ) indicate that  C. holochlora  is sister to the genus  Lepidothrix  and not closely related to true  Xenopipo .  Rearrange the genera in the family Pipridae in the following new sequence:   Chiroxiphia    Corapipo    Cryptopipo    Lepidothrix    Manacus    Dixiphia    Ceratopipra   p. 473. After the species account for  Campylorhynchus chiapensis , insert the following new account:    Campylorhynchus griseus   (Swainson). Bicolored Wren.   Furnarius griseus  Swainson, 1837, Anim.

Accidental in Alaska (an immature male at St. Paul Island, Pribilofs, 8&ndash;9 October 2013; photos; North American Birds 68:167, 2014;  Pranty et al. 2014 ).  pp. 569&ndash;599. Phylogenetic analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences ( Barker et al. 2013 ,  2015 ;  Burns et al. 2014 ) has shown that the composition and linear sequence of genera and species in the family Thraupidae do not accurately reflect their evolutionary relationships. Their findings result in the following changes:  Under the heading Family  THRAUPIDAE : Tanagers, insert the following:  Linear sequence of genera follows  Burns et al. (2014) .  Remove the genus  Coereba , its citation, and the species account for   Coereba flaveola   from genus   incertae sedis  , and position them in the Thraupidae in the linear sequence as indicated below. Delete the heading  Genus    INCERTAE SEDIS  . After the citation for the genus, insert the following:  Formerly placed in the monotypic family Coerebidae, but analysis of sequences of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA ( Barker et al. 2013 ,  2015 ;  Burns et al. 2014 ) indicates that its correct placement is in the Thraupidae.  Remove the genus  Saltator , its citation, and its included species from genus   incertae sedis  , and place them in the Thraupidae in the linear sequence as indicated below. Delete the heading  Genus    INCERTAE SEDIS  . Replace the first two sentences of the Notes for  Saltator  with the following: Formerly placed in the Cardinalidae, but analysis of sequences of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA ( Barker et al. 2013 ,  2015 ;  Burns et al. 2014 ) indicates that its correct placement is in the Thraupidae.  Delete the Notes under the heading Family  EMBERIZIDAE : Emberizids.  Remove the genus headings, citations, and included species for  Volatinia ,  Sporophila ,  Melopyrrha ,  Tiaris ,  Loxipasser ,  Loxigilla ,  Euneornis ,  Melanospiza ,  Pinaroloxias ,  Haplospiza ,  Acanthidops ,  Diglossa ,  Sicalis , and  Emberizoides  from the Emberizidae and place them in the Thraupidae in the linear sequence as indicated below.  Under the headings Genus   VOLATINIA   Reichenbach, Genus   MELOPYRRHA   Bonaparte, Genus   TIARIS   Swainson, Genus   LOXIPASSER   Bryant, Genus   LOXIGILLA   Lesson, Genus   MELANOSPIZA   Ridgway, Genus   PINAROLOXIAS   Sharpe, Genus   SICALIS   Boie, and Genus   EMBERIZOIDES   Temminck, insert the following:  Formerly placed in the Emberizidae, but analysis of sequences of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA ( Barker et al. 2013 ,  2015 ;  Burns et al. 2014 ) indicates that its correct placement is in the Thraupidae.  Under the headings Genus   EUNEORNIS   Fitzinger, Genus   HAPLOSPIZA   Cabanis, and Genus   ACANTHIDOPS   Ridgway, replace the existing Notes with the following: Formerly placed in the Emberizidae, but analysis of sequences of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA ( Barker et al. 2013 ,  2015 ;  Burns et al. 2014 ) indicates that its correct placement is in the Thraupidae.  Under the headings Genus   SPOROPHILA   Cabanis and Genus   DIGLOSSA   Wagler, add the following to the beginning of the Notes: Formerly placed in the Emberizidae, but analysis of sequences of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA ( Barker et al. 2013 ,  2015 ;  Burns et al. 2014 ) indicates that its correct placement is in the Thraupidae.  Following the species account for  Saltator striatipectus , insert the following new heading and Notes:   Genera    INCERTAE SEDIS     Nesospingus ,  Phaenicophilus ,  Calyptophilus ,  Rhodinocichla ,  Mitrospingus , and  Spindalis , formerly placed in the Thraupidae, are part of the nine-primaried oscine radiation but do not belong to the Thraupidae or to any other traditionally recognized family ( Barker et al. 2013 ,  2015 ). These taxa are placed as genera   incertae sedis   as a temporary measure, pending consideration of the classification of  Barker et al. (2013) , who proposed that each genus be accorded family status (Nesospingidae, Phaenicophilidae, etc.).  Move the genus headings and species accounts for   Nesospingus speculiferus  , the two species of  Phaenicophilus , the two species of  Calyptophilus ,  Rhodinocichla rosea ,  Mitrospingus cassinii , and the four species of  Spindalis , in this linear sequence, from Thraupidae and insert them under this new heading.  Under the headings Genus   NESOSPINGUS   Sclater, Genus   PHAENICOPHILUS   Strickland, Genus   CALYPTOPHILUS   Cory, and Genus   MITROSPINGUS   Ridgway insert:  Formerly placed in the Thraupidae; see Notes under Genera   incertae sedis   above.  Replace the existing Notes under the headings Genus   RHODINOCICHLA   Hartlaub and Genus   SPINDALIS   Jardine and Selby with: Formerly placed in the Thraupidae; see Notes under Genera   incertae sedis   above.  Rearrange the sequence of genera in the Thraupidae to:   Bangsia    Paroaria    Thraupis    Tangara    Conirostrum    Sicalis    Haplospiza    Acanthidops    Diglossa    Chlorophanes    Chrysothlypis    Heterospingus    Hemithraupis    Volatinia    Eucometis    Tachyphonus    Lanio    Ramphocelus    Tersina    Cyanerpes    Dacnis    Coereba    Tiaris    Euneornis    Loxigilla    Melopyrrha    Loxipasser    Melanospiza    Pinaroloxias    Sporophila    Emberizoides    Saltator   Under the heading Genus   RAMPHOCELUS   Desmarest, insert the following:  Linear sequence of species follows  Burns et al. (2014) .  Rearrange the sequence of species in  Ramphocelus  to:   Ramphocelus sanguinolentus    Ramphocelus flammigerus    Ramphocelus passerinii    Ramphocelus costaricensis     Ramphocelus dimidiatus    Rearrange the sequence of species in  Sporophila  to:    Sporophila lineola     Sporophila funerea    Sporophila crassirostris    Sporophila nuttingi    Sporophila corvina    Sporophila schistacea    Sporophila torqueola    Sporophila nigricollis    Sporophila minuta   p. 610. Phylogenetic analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences ( Klicka et al. 2014 ) has shown that the genus  Spizella  is polyphyletic. Their findings result in the following changes:  Move the heading Genus   SPIZELLA   Bonaparte and its citation to precede the species account for   Spizella passerina  .  After the species account for  Torreornis inexpectata , insert the following heading and citation:   Spizelloides  Klicka and Slager, 2014, Zootaxa 3821:399. Type, by monotypy,  Fringilla arborea  Wilson.  Change    Spizella arborea    (Wilson) to   Spizelloides arborea   (Wilson).  Insert the following at the beginning of the Notes for  Spizelloides arborea : Formerly placed in the genus  Spizella , but analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences ( Klicka et al. 2014 ) indicates that   S. arborea   is not closely related to true  Spizella .  pp. 671&ndash;679. Phylogenetic analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences ( Lerner et al. 2011 ) and a synthesis of molecular, morphological, and behavioral data ( Pratt 2014 ) have shown that the generic limits and linear sequence of genera in the Hawaiian honeycreepers do not accurately reflect their evolutionary relationships. Their findings result in the following changes:  Change    Vestiaria coccinea    (Forster) to   Drepanis coccinea   (Forster), delete the genus heading and Notes for  Vestiaria , move the citation for  Vestiaria  into the synonymy of  Drepanis , insert the species account for  Drepanis coccinea  to follow the heading and citation for  Drepanis , and insert the following Notes at the end of the species account for  Drepanis coccinea :  Formerly placed in the genus  Vestiaria ; see comments under  Drepanis .  Replace the existing Notes under the heading Genus   DREPANIS   Temminck with the following:   Vestiaria  and  Drepanis , previously considered separate genera, are merged on the basis of morphological similarity ( Pratt 1979 ,  Olson 2012 ,  Knowlton et al. 2014 ).  Delete the Notes under Genus   HEMIGNATHUS   Lichtenstein and move the species accounts for  Hemignathus lucidus  and  Hemignathus munroi  to follow this heading and its citations.  Change   Hemignathus munroi   to   Hemignathus wilsoni   and substitute the following for the existing Notes:  Formerly known as  Hemignathus munroi   Pratt, 1979 , due to priority of the name  Heterorhynchus wilsoni  Rothschild, 1893, when both taxa were included in  Hemignathus .  After the species account for  Hemignathus wilsoni , insert the following heading:  Genus   AKIALOA   Olson and James  Remove the citation for this genus from the synonymy of  Hemignathus , place it to follow this new heading, and insert the following:  Formerly considered part of  Hemignathus  ( AOU 1983 ,  1998 ), but genetic and morphological data ( Tarr and Fleischer 1993 ,  1995 ;  Fleischer et al. 1998 ;  James 2004 ;  Reding et al. 2008 ;  Lerner et al. 2011 ) indicate that the expanded version of  Hemignathus  ( Pratt 1979 ) is not a monophyletic group.  Change   Hemignathus obscurus   and   Hemignathus ellisianus   to   Akialoa obscura   and   Akialoa ellisiana  , respectively, and place the accounts for these species under the heading and Notes for  Akialoa .  Replace the existing distributional statement and Notes for  Akialoa obscura  with the following:  EXTINCT. Formerly  resident  in the mountains of Hawaii (last collected in 1903, last sight report 1940) in the Hawaiian Islands.   A. obscura  and  A. ellisiana sensu lato  are sometimes treated as conspecific (e.g., Greenway  in   Paynter 1968 ,  Olson and James 1982 ), in which case  A. obscura  &lsqb;Akialoa&rsqb; is the appropriate name. See comments under  A. stejnegeri .  After the species account for  Akialoa ellisiana , insert the following heading:   Chlorodrepanis  Wilson and Evans (ex Perkins MS), 1899, Aves Hawaiienses, p. xxi. Type, by subsequent designation (Richmond, 1902, Proc. U.S. Nat. Mus., 24, p. 673),  Himatione stejnegeri  Wilson.  Change    Hemignathus virens   ,    Hemignathus flavus   , and   Hemignathus kauaiensis   to   Chlorodrepanis virens  ,   Chlorodrepanis flava  , and   Chlorodrepanis stejnegeri  , respectively, and move the accounts for these species to follow the citation for  Chlorodrepanis .  Replace the existing Notes for  Chlorodrepanis virens  with the following:  This species and the following two species,   C. flava   and  C. stejnegeri , were formerly placed in the genus  Hemignathus . They have also sometimes been placed, along with  Viridonia sagittirostris , in  Viridonia  (e.g., Greenway  in   Paynter 1968 ) or in  Loxops  ( Amadon 1947 ,  1950 ;  James and Olson 1991 ). The following two species have been considered conspecific with  virens  (e.g., Greenway  in   Paynter 1968 ), but are here considered separate species based on studies by  Johnson et al. (1989)  and  Tarr and Fleischer (1993) .  Johnson et al. (1989)  showed that the group on Molokai, Maui, and Lanai ( C. wilsoni  Rothschild, 1893 &lsqb;Maui Amakihi&rsqb;) is genetically closest to  virens .  Replace the existing Notes for  Chlorodrepanis flava  with the following:  See Notes under  Chlorodrepanis virens .    Replace the existing Notes for  Chlorodrepanis stejnegeri  with the following:  Formerly placed in the genus  Hemignathus . When included in  Hemignathus , the species name  stejnegeri  is preoccupied by  Hemignathus stejnegeri  Wilson, 1889 &lsqb;Kauai Akialoa&rsqb;, and  kauaiensis   Pratt, 1989  is used. See  Conant et al. (1998)  for reasons for treating  C. stejnegeri  as a species.  After the species account for  Chlorodrepanis stejnegeri , insert the following heading:  Genus   VIRIDONIA   Rothschild  Remove the citation for this genus from the synonymy of  Hemignathus , place it to follow this new heading, change   Hemignathus sagittirostris   (Rothschild) to   Viridonia sagittirostris   Rothschild, move the account for this species to follow the citation, and change the Notes for this species to the following:  Formerly placed in the genus  Hemignathus , but genetic and morphological data ( Tarr and Fleischer 1993 ,  1995 ;  Fleischer et al. 1998 ;  James 2004 ;  Reding et al. 2008 ;  Lerner et al. 2011 ) indicate that the expanded version of  Hemignathus  ( Pratt 1979 ) is not a monophyletic group.  Rearrange the sequence of genera from  Telespiza  to  Melamprosops  to:   Melamprosops    Oreomystis    Paroreomyza    Loxioides    Telespiza    Chloridops    Rhodacanthis    Ciridops    Palmeria    Himatione    Drepanis    Psittirostra    Dysmorodrepanis    Pseudonestor    Hemignathus    Akialoa    Magumma    Chlorodrepanis    Viridonia    Loxops   Delete the existing Notes under Genus   LOXIOIDES   Oustalet, Genus   TELESPIZA   Wilson, Genus   CHLORIDOPS   Wilson, Genus   RHODACANTHIS   Rothschild, Genus   PSITTIROSTRA   Temminck, and Genus   DYSMORODREPANIS   Perkins, and replace the existing Notes under Genus   MELAMPROSOPS   Casey and Jacobi with the following:   Notes. &mdash; Melamprosops  and the following 19 genera constitute the Hawaiian honeycreepers, formerly ( AOU 1983 ,  1998 ) considered to constitute the subfamily Drepanidinae. Linear sequence of these genera follows  Lerner et al. (2011)  and  Pratt (2014) .  p. 675.  Akialoa stejnegeri  and  A. lanaiensis  are treated as species separate from  A. ellisiana . In the species account for  A. ellisiana , add a dagger (&dagger;) before the scientific name, change the English name to Oahu Akialoa, and change the distributional statement and Notes to:  EXTINCT. Formerly  resident  in the mountains of Oahu (last collected in 1837, last sight report 1939).  See Notes under  A. stejnegeri .  Before the species account for  A. ellisiana , insert the following new account:   Hemignathus Stejnegeri  Wilson, 1889, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 4, p. 400. (Kauai.)  Humid montane forest.  Probably extinct. Formerly  resident  in the mountains of Kauai (Alakai plateau; last collected in 1960, last sight report 1965).  Formerly ( AOU 1998 ) considered conspecific with  A. ellisiana  and  A. lanaiensis  (and previously also with  obscura ;  AOU 1983 ), but these are treated as separate species on the basis of sympatry between some taxa in  Akialoa  and a lack of knowledge of relationships among these taxa ( Olson and James 1995 ,  Pratt 2014 ).  After the species account for  A. ellisiana , insert the following new account:  &dagger;  Akialoa lanaiensis   (Rothschild). Maui-nui Akialoa.   Hemignathus lanaiensis  Rothschild, 1893, Bull. Brit. Ornithol. Club 1:24. (Lanai.)  Humid montane forest.  EXTINCT. Formerly  resident  in the mountains of Lanai (last collected in 1892, last sight report 1894).  See Notes under  A. stejnegeri .  p. 675.  Hemignathus hanapepe  and  Hemignathus affinis  are treated as species separate from  H. lucidus . In the species account for  H. lucidus , add a dagger (&dagger;) before the scientific name, change the English name to Oahu Nukupuu, and change the distributional statement and Notes to:  EXTINCT. Formerly  resident  in the mountains of Oahu (last collected in 1837, possible sight reports until 1860).  See Notes under  H. hanapepe .  Before the species account for  H. lucidus , insert the following new account:    Hemignathus hanapepe   Wilson. Kauai Nukupuu.   Hemignathus hanapepe  Wilson, 1889, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 4, p. 401. (Kauai.)  Humid montane forest, especially ohia and koa.  Probably extinct. Formerly  resident  in the mountains of Kauai (last collected in 1899, sight reports until 1990s in the Alakai plateau region).  Formerly considered conspecific with  H. lucidus  and  H. affinis , but treated as separate species on the basis of plumage differences commensurate with those observed among several other species groups of Hawaiian honeycreepers ( Pratt et al. 2001 ,  Pratt and Pratt 2001 ).  After the species account for  H. lucidus , insert the following new account:    Hemignathus affinis   Rothschild. Maui Nukupuu.  Humid montane forest, especially ohia and koa.  Possibly extinct, or  resident  locally in precarious numbers in the mountains of eastern Maui (windward slopes of Haleakala; last collected in 1896, last sight report 1996).  See Notes under  H. hanapepe .  p. 677.  Loxops wolstenholmei  and  Loxops ochraceus  are treated as species separate from  L. coccineus . In the species account for  L. coccineus , change the English name to Hawaii Akepa, and change the habitat and distributional statements and Notes to:  Humid montane forest, primarily ohia-koa and ohia.   Resident  in the mountains of Hawaii (rare and local).  See Notes under  L. wolstenholmei .  Before the species account for  L. coccineus , insert the following two new accounts, in this sequence:    Loxops wolstenholmei   Rothschild. Oahu Akepa.   Loxops wolstenholmei  Rothschild, 1893, Ibis, p. 570. (Oahu.)  Humid montane forest, primarily ohia-koa and ohia.  Probably extinct. Formerly  resident  in the mountains of Oahu (last collected in 1893, last sight report 1976).  Formerly considered conspecific with  Loxops coccineus  and  Loxops ochraceus , but treated as separate species on the basis of plumage and behavioral differences greater than those among the three species of amakihi ( Pratt 2010 ,  2014 ).    Loxops ochraceus   Rothschild. Maui Akepa.   Loxops ochracea  Rothschild, 1893, Ibis, p. 112. (Maui.)  Humid montane forest, primarily ohia-koa and ohia.  Probably extinct. Formerly  resident  in the mountains of eastern Maui (last collected ca. 1900, last sight report 1980).  See Notes under  L. wolstenholmei .  p. 678.  Himatione fraithii  is treated as a species separate from   H. sanguinea  . In the species account for   H. sanguinea  , change the habitat and distributional statements and Notes to:  Humid montane forests, primarily ohia&ndash;koa, but occasionally in mixed native&ndash;exotic forest.   Resident  in the mountains in the Hawaiian Islands (all main islands from Kauai eastward).  Accidental on Niihau.  See Notes under  H. fraithii .  Before the species account for   H. sanguinea  , insert the following new account:  &dagger;  Himatione fraithii   Rothschild. Laysan Honeycreeper.   Himatione fraithii  Rothschild, 1892, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 10, p. 109. (Laysan.)  Brushy areas and bunchgrass.  EXTINCT. Formerly  resident  on Laysan Island (extinct since 1923).  Formerly considered conspecific with   H. sanguinea  , but treated as a separate species on the basis of differences in song and song phenology, feeding behavior, nest placement and structure, habitat, and morphology ( Pratt and Pratt 2001 ,  Pratt 2005 ). Sometimes known by the species name  freethi ; however, this is an unjustified emendation of the original spelling  fraithii  ( Pyle 2011 ).  p. 685. Delete the account for   Phoebastria irrorata   from the Appendix.  p. 691. In the Appendix, change   Buteo polyosoma   to   Geranoaetus polyosoma   and change the English name of this species from Red-backed Hawk to Variable Hawk. In the account for this species, change   B. swainsoni   to   Buteo swainsoni   and change the last sentence to the following: The origin of the bird remains highly questionable ( Allen 1988 ).  p. 691. In the Appendix, following the species account for  Porphyrio porphyrio , insert the following new account:    Anthropoides virgo    ( Linnaeus). Demoiselle Crane.   Ardea Virgo , Linnaeus, 1758, Syst. Nat., ed. 10, 1, p. 141. (&ldquo;In Oriente&rdquo; &equals; India.)  An individual was photographed wintering with Sandhill Cranes near Lodi and Staten Island, San Joaquin County, California, from 30 September 2001 to 18 February 2002; probably the same individual was photographed later near Smithers, British Columbia, on 2 May 2002, and again probably the same bird at Gustavus, southeast Alaska, 13&ndash;14 May 2002 ( Hamilton et al. 2007 ,  Howell et al. 2014 ). The species was placed on the Supplemental List, indicating uncertain origin, by the California Bird Records Committee ( Cole and McCaskie 2004 ). It is not rare in captivity in North America, and previous escapes are known. On the other hand, the species is highly migratory and has occurred as a stray throughout western Europe, north to the Orkney Islands and Scandinavia, and in northern Russia, far from its normal central and southern Asian and African range.  p. 691. In the Appendix, following the species account for  Anthropoides virgo , insert the following new account:    Grus monacha   Temminck. Hooded Crane.   Grus monacha  Temminck, 1835, Pl. col., livr. 94, pl. 555. (Hokkaido and Korea.)  Sight reports (at least some documented with photographs) of this eastern Asian species from Idaho (April 2010), Nebraska (April 2011), Tennessee (December 2011&ndash;January 2012), and Indiana (February 2012), perhaps all of the same bird, were detailed by  Pranty et al. (2014) . Although accepted by three states' rare bird committees (not yet reviewed by the Idaho committee), the origin of these records was questioned by the American Birding Association's Checklist Committee ( Pranty et al. 2014 ). The issue of origin (wild versus escape) is best considered unresolved at this time.  p. 693. Delete the account for  Patagioenas goodsoni  from the Appendix.  pp. 705 ff.
