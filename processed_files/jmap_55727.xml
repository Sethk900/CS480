Soil microbial biomass and organic matter fractions during transition from conventional to organic farming systemsThe aim of this study was to investigate the response of soil microbial biomass and organic matter fractions during the transition from conventional to organic farming in a tropical soil. Soil samples were collected from three different plots planted with Malpighia glaba: conventional plot with 10 years (CON); transitional plot with 2 years under organic farming system (TRA); organic plot with 5 years under organic farming system (ORG). A plot under native vegetation (NV) was used as a reference. Soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN), soil organic carbon (SOC) and total N (TN), soil organic matter fractioning and microbial indices were evaluated in soil samples collected at 0–5, 5–10, 10–20 and 20–40 cm depth. SOC and fulvic acids fraction contents were higher in the ORG system at 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm depths. Soil MBC was highest in the ORG, in all depths, than in others plots. Soil MBN was similar between ORG, TRA and NV in the surface layer. The lowest values for soil MBC and MBN were observed in CON plot. Soil microbial biomass increased gradually from conventional to organic farming, leading to consistent and distinct differences from the conventional control by the end of the second year.
