So far this definition is intuitive and no direct proof has been provided. We compared flowers of coffee mutants (Decafitto), which exhibit minimal production and secretion of exudate by colleters, with normal plants, to provide a proof of concept that the exudate covering the flowers plays a role against dehydration and acts as an adhesive to keep the petals united until flower opening.Colleters are protuberances or trichomes that produce and release an exudate that overlays vegetative or reproductive buds. Colleters have a functional definition, as they are thought to protect young tissues against dehydration and pest attack. Decaffeinated coffee plants, named Decaffito<sup>®</sup>, have recently been obtained through chemical mutagenesis, and in addition to the absence of the alkaloid, the flowers of these plants open precociously. Decaffito mutants exhibit minimal production and secretion of the exudate by the colleters. We compared these mutants with normal coffee plants to infer the functional role of colleters and the secreted exudate covering flower buds. Decaffito mutants were obtained by sodium azide mutagenesis of <italic>Coffea arabica</italic> cv. Catuaí seeds. Wild-type plants were used as controls and are referred to as Catuaí. The flower colleters were analysed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy in addition to histochemical analysis. Histochemical analysis indicated the presence of heterogeneous exudate in the secretory cells of the colleters of both variants of coffee trees. Alkaloids were detected in Catuaí but not in Decaffito. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the secretory cells in the Catuaí colleters possessed the normal and common characteristics found in secretory structures. In the secretory cells of the Decaffito colleters, it was not possible to identify any organelles or even the nucleus, but the cells had a darkened central cytoplasm, indicating that the secretion is produced in low amounts but not released. Our results offer a proof of concept of colleters in coffee, strongly indicating that the exudate covering the flower parts works as an adhesive to keep the petals together and the flower closed, which in part helps to avoid dehydration. Additionally, the exudate itself helps to prevent water loss from the epidermal cells of the petals.Colleters have been defined as secretory structures present in different organs of members of &gt;60 angiosperm families, including Rubiaceae, Loganiaceae and Apocynaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C54">Thomas and Dave 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C38">Miguel <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>). Structurally, they can appear as trichomes or as emergences that are formed from both epidermal and subepidermal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C13">Foster 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C1">Appezzato-da-Gloria and Estelita 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C9">Evert 2007</xref>).Morphology, location and the chemical nature of the exudate are the criteria used to define the term colleter, but in fact the functional concept is the common link connecting most reports of this structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C32">Mayer <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). The term colleter originates from the Greek word ‘colla’, which means glue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C13">Foster 1949</xref>). The nature of the sticky resinous or mucilaginous substance released by the colleters is diverse, and polysaccharides, proteins and lipids have been described as components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C36">Miguel <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>). These structures differentiate early, and their function seems to be to provide physical or chemical defences for the shoot apex and lateral buds against insect and pathogen attack. However, the occurrence of colleters is not limited to these plant parts, as they also occur in reproductive organs and seedlings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C7">De-Paula and Oliveira 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C32">Mayer <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). Other reports suggest that colleters and the exudate protect juvenile plant structures against dehydration because the exudate permeates and overlays the entire meristem and juvenile organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C53">Thomas and Dave 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C55">Thomas <italic>et al</italic>. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C25">Klein <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C1">Appezzato-da-Gloria and Estelita (2000)</xref> argued that the exudate prevents water loss in hot tropical climates. In addition to dehydration protection, it has also been suggested that by covering the shoot apex meristem, the exudate may act as a physical barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C37">Miguel <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>). It is important to supplement morphological, structural and developmental data with information on the secretory product from histochemical tests or chemical analysis to construct an association between the definition of colleter and its functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C47">Radford <italic>et al</italic>. 1974</xref>).Although the alleged role of the colleter and its exudate is to protect plant parts against water loss and attack by insects and pathogens, only indirect evidence of this role has been obtained. Only a few reports have analysed the composition of the resinous material and have suggested such a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C36">Miguel <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref> and references therein). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C36">Miguel <italic>et al</italic>. (2006)</xref>, who demonstrated an <italic>in vitro</italic> fungicide property (spore germination) of the exudate from the colleters of <italic>Bathysa nicholsonii</italic> K. Schum. (Rubiaceae), the exudate protects the shoot apical meristem against pathogen attack. Another function attributed to the exudate from colleters is related to nutritional aspects regarding bacterial leaf nodule symbiosis with the Rubiaceae species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C21">Horner and Lersten 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C29">Lersten 1975</xref>).The colleters in the stipules of <italic>Coffea arabica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C44">Patel and Zaveri 1975</xref>) are classified as ‘standard type’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C27">Lersten 1974<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C28"><italic>b</italic></xref>). This type of colleter is formed by a secretory epidermis and the central axis of parenchyma cells, without vascular tissue. The origin of this type of colleter involves the protoderm and the ground meristem, as described for the colleters of <italic>Caryocar brasiliense</italic> Camb. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C42">Paiva and Machado 2006<italic>a</italic></xref>).Under Brazilian climate conditions, coffee (<italic>C. arabica</italic>) floral buds start to differentiate from axillary buds in January at the leaf axils that pre-formed in August of the previous year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C31">Majerowicz and Söndahl 2005</xref>). During the shorter days of April, the induction of the existing leaf buds to flower buds intensifies. Once they have developed into mature buds, they become dormant. Dormancy coincides with the start of the dry season, and as soon as the first rains of spring begin, flowering is triggered and anthesis occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C5">Camargo and Camargo 2001</xref>). During development, coffee buds/flowers are covered by a viscous exudate of unknown composition. The functional role of this secretion has never been proved, but it is argued that it protects the dormant coffee floral bud from dehydration during the dry season, as has been suggested for many other plant species.(A) Flowers of Decaffito on a branch of a plant in the field and (B) open flowers of Catuaí and Decaffito.Here, we report that the flowers of Decaffito open precociously because of the lack of exudate released by colleters. In normal flowers, the viscosity of the exudate seems to hold the petals together, acting as an adhesive, and does not allow them to open until they absorb water, swell and can then overcome the barrier imposed by the exudate. Furthermore, the exudate seems to protect against dehydration through the formation of a thick layer on the young flower buds, which have numerous stomata on the external petal surface. This information is the first direct evidence for a functional role of colleters and their exudate.<italic>Coffea arabica</italic> cv. Catuaí Vermelho and cv. Decaffito were used in this study. The plants were grown in the experimental field of the Department of Plant Biology of the State University of Campinas, Campinas-SP, Brazil. Catuaí is a commercial cultivar and contains ∼1.2 % caffeine on a dry weight (DW) basis in its fruits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C19">Guerreiro Filho and Mazzafera 2003</xref>) and 0.8 % DW in its leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C18">Guerreiro Filho and Mazzafera 2000</xref>).Decaffito mutants were obtained by treating Catuaí Vermelho seeds with sodium azide (0.003 or 0.01 % in 200 mM sodium phosphate pH 3, 48 h) and then germinating them in a sand bed. Approximately 33 000 plants were analysed for caffeine in the leaves using high-performance liquid chromatography, and seven were found to be almost devoid of caffeine. These plants were then transferred to field conditions (P. Mazzafera, unpubl. res.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C3">Borrell 2012</xref>). Samples of the flower buds and flowers at different developmental stages were collected from these plants and used in our studies.Samples were fixed under vacuum as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C24">Karnovsky (1965</xref>; modified by preparation in phosphate buffer pH 7.2) for 24 h and dehydrated in an ethanol series (10, 30, 50 and 70 %) and then in a <italic>tert</italic>-butyl alcohol (TBA) series (70, 85, 95 and 100 %) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C23">Johansen 1940</xref>) for 48 h in each solution. The last dehydration in 100 % TBA was repeated three times. A three-fourths volume of solid Paraplast X-tra<sup>®</sup> (Fisher) was added to the samples in 100 % TBA, and the mixture was maintained at 58 °C. The Paraplast was changed three times, every 12 h. The samples were placed on moulds to solidify, and serial sections (5µm thick) were cut on a rotary microtome (Leica) and distended in heated plates at 48 °C. The Paraplast was removed by immersion of the slides in xylene, and the sections were subsequently rehydrated in absolute ethanol followed by distilled water. The sections were stained with safranin and astra-blue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C14">Gerlach 1969</xref>) and mounted in Entellan<sup>®</sup> synthetic resin (Merck). Photomicrographs were taken with an Olympus BX 51 photomicroscope equipped with an Olympus DP71 camera.Samples were fixed, dehydrated and embedded as described above. The chemical nature of the substances found in the secretory cells of the colleters and the exudate was determined using the following histochemical tests: periodic acid–Schiff's reaction for 1,2-glycol groups present in polysaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C35">McManus 1948</xref>); ruthenium red for acid polysaccharides and pectic substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C23">Johansen 1940</xref>); Wagner's reagent for alkaloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C56">Wagner <italic>et al</italic>. 1984</xref>); aniline blue black (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C12">Fisher 1968</xref>) to identify proteins; and Sudan black B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C45">Pearse 1985</xref>) and Nile blue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C4">Cain 1947</xref>) for neutral (stained pink) and acidic (stained blue) lipids to identify the aliphatic compounds.

The samples were attached to aluminium stubs and coated with gold (30–40 nm). Finally, the samples were examined under a LEO model VP 435 scanning electron microscope at 20 kV.Samples of bract with colleters were fixed by Karnovsky's method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C24">Karnovsky 1965</xref>; modified by preparation in phosphate buffer pH 7.2), post-fixed in 1 % osmium tetroxide (0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.2) for 2 h, dehydrated by an acetone series and embedded in Araldite resin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C49">Roland 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C50">Silva and Machado 1999</xref>).

The secretory phase of colleters begins at the induction of the reproductive meristem and remains active during the development of the flower bud.Histochemical characterization of the exudate of colleters.

This accumulation creates pressure under the cuticle, causing it to rupture and release the exudate (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLT029F3">3</xref>E–G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLT029F6">6</xref>K).Transmission electron micrographs of Catuaí colleters.

Thus, the presence of colleters in the stipules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C44">Patel and Zaveri 1975</xref>) and bracts of <italic>C. arabica</italic> reinforces the idea that they may have a protective role. Colleters occur exclusively on the adaxial face of bracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C27">Lersten 1974<italic>a</italic></xref>) and are positioned above and adjacent to the reproductive meristem. The beginning of the secretory phase occurs prior to the development of flower organs, and as the flower buds start to develop, they are already covered by the exudate released from the colleters.Both coffee plants in this study were grown in Campinas (SP, Brazil), where it is well established that coffee floral buds start to differentiate from axillary buds in January at leaf axils that pre-formed in August of the previous year. The formation of flower primordia occurs in March/April (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C31">Majerowicz and Söndahl 2005</xref>). Starting in May, the temperature and rain precipitation decline and remain low compared with other months until August/September. During this winter period, the vegetative growth of the flower buds ceases, and they remain dormant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C31">Majerowicz and Söndahl 2005</xref>). The same climatic conditions apply to Catuaí and Decaffito, although the flower buds of the latter remain dormant, and no growth is observed. Because Decaffito does not have the presumed protection of the colleter exudate, the flower buds are exposed to low air humidity and may dehydrate. We suggest here that the colleter exudate in coffee also functions to keep the petals united, acting as an adhesive, by ‘sealing’ the bud. Once closed, the flowers may be partially protected from dehydration. In Decaffito, the petals are freed due to the lack of exudate. They also lose water from the external surface due to the presence of many stomata (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLT029F4">4</xref>G), which may cause differential tension between the internal and external cell surfaces, forcing the petals to curve and open precociously (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLT029F1">1</xref>A) before flower development is complete and when the flowers are still dormant. At the beginning of the rainy season, in September/October, the dormancy is broken and anthesis occurs after 10–12 days of the first rain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C31">Majerowicz and Söndahl 2005</xref>). This is observed for both Catuaí and Decaffito, whose flowers are smaller than those of the former, most likely as a consequence of dehydration stress during the dry season (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLT029F1">1</xref>B). Thus, considering that Catuaí and Decaffito flowers differ regarding the presence of exudate, the Decaffito flowers provide functional proof of the role of colleters in protecting coffee flowers from dehydration and controlling their opening.The histochemical evaluation showed that the difference in composition of the exudate of Catuaí and Decaffito was the absence of alkaloids in the latter, as would be expected given that Decaffito was selected for low caffeine content after sodium azide mutagenesis. The marked detection of caffeine in Catuaí is in agreement with chemical analysis, which showed that the caffeine content in the coffee flowers is among the highest of the different parts of the coffee tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C20">Hamidi and Wanner 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C48">Raju and Gopal 1979</xref>).The histochemical tests also revealed that the exudate composition was highly heterogeneous and complex. Polysaccharides, pectic substances, alkaloids, proteins and lipophilic substances were detected. Complex polysaccharide polymers of high molecular mass seem to play a role as an adhesive to aid in seed dispersion by fixing them to animals and by helping carnivorous plants to capture insects or to lubricate the root apex and facilitate interaction with microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C11">Fahn 1988</xref> and references therein). Additionally, the hydrophilic characteristics of these polymers seem to assist in maintaining appropriate humidity levels in the meristem and developing organs during dry periods, when soil water content and air humidity are low and temperatures are high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C26">Kronestedt-Robards and Robards 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C41">Paiva 2009</xref>). On the other hand, the colleter exudate is insoluble in water, which is most likely related to the lipid-like substances, produced to prevent water loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C53">Thomas and Dave 1989</xref>). The Catuaí exudate showed intense colouration for lipids. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C26">Kronestedt-Robards and Robards (1991)</xref> suggested that these substances could also inhibit the development of pathogenic microorganisms. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C42">Paiva and Machado (2006<italic>a</italic>)</xref> suggested that proteins found in the exudate of colleters of <italic>C. brasiliense</italic> may have an anti-pathogenic function because they found enzyme activities related to chitinases and β-1,3-glucanases, which are usually related to protection against pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C17">Goy <italic>et al</italic>. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C15">Giannakis <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>). The presence of protein in the exudate of colleters has also been related to the protection of meristems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C25">Klein <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C16">Gonzalez and Tarragó 2009</xref>) but without a defined function. Although controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C18">Guerreiro Filho and Mazzafera 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C19">2003</xref>), caffeine has been suggested to protect plants against insect attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C39">Nathanson 1984</xref>). However, it is noteworthy that at any time point, the Decaffito flowers were not observed as more likely to be under attack by insects or microorganisms than Catuaí or any other known <italic>C. arabica</italic> cultivar or coffee species containing caffeine (P. Mazzafera, pers. observ.), which suggests that, at least in coffee, the caffeine in the exudate from colleters does not have a function related to pest or pathogen protection.The exudate covering the Catuaí flowers is mainly composed of polysaccharides and pectic compounds, which in turn seems to explain the presence of numerous dictyosomes in the secretory cells. Proteins were also densely stained. The secretion of protein–carbohydrate mucilage indicates participation of the Golgi complex and amyloplasts as well as the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the release process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C11">Fahn 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C9">Evert 2007</xref>). Amyloplasts are abundant in nectariferous tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C11">Fahn 1988</xref>). They can act as organelles for the storage of substances necessary for the synthesis of the polysaccharide component of the nectar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C46">Rachmilevitz and Fahn 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C40">Nepi <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>).Epidermal cells of the colleters of Catuaí showed normal and common characteristics of secretory structures, with an evident nucleus, dense cytoplasm, various dictyosomes and mitochondria. However, the secretory cells of Decaffito did not show any distinguishable organelles, not even the nucleus, but only a darkened cytoplasm. In these cells, the exudate is produced in lower amounts than in Catuaí, and it is not secreted.The exudate produced in Catuaí and Decaffito accumulates in subcuticular and intercellular spaces. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C43">Paiva and Machado (2006<italic>b</italic>)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C1">Appezzato-da-Gloria and Estelita (2000)</xref> argued that such subcuticular spaces are formed by dissolution of the middle lamella due to enzyme activities along the anticlinal walls of the epithelial cells. Such processes increase the surface area from which the exudate is released as well as the space in which it can accumulate. Rupture of the cuticle by an increase in pressure caused by exudate accumulation in the subcuticular space has been observed in the colleters of other species of Rubiaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C54">Thomas and Dave 1990</xref>), Caryocaraceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C42">Paiva and Machado 2006<italic>a</italic></xref>) and Apocynaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C53">Thomas and Dave 1989</xref>), which strongly suggests an absence of pores in the cuticle to facilitate exudate release.Like any other secretory structure, colleters senesce after a secretory phase in which marked anatomical and ultrastructural alterations occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C8">Dickinson 2000</xref>). In the colleters of Catuaí, the main alteration observed with senescence was the state of the cytoplasm, from dense to less dense, and an enlargement of the vacuole. During the senescing phase of the colleters of <italic>B. nicholsonii</italic>, the secretory cells showed a disorganized system of endomembranes, and it was not possible to distinguish organelles, suggesting programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C37">Miguel <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>). We could not visualize or distinguish any structural organization inside the secretory cells of the colleters of Decaffito in any phase. We speculate that such an occurrence is most likely related to a precocious programmed cell death process.The Decaffito plants have very low caffeine content in all tissues, and this characteristic is profoundly associated with precocious flower opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C3">Borrell 2012</xref>; P. Mazzafera, unpubl. res.). Similar to natural mutants of <italic>C. arabica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C51">Silvarolla <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>), Decaffito plants accumulate theobromine, indicating a metabolic blockade of the last step of caffeine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT029C33">Mazzafera <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Although it is still not clear what controls caffeine biosynthesis in Decaffito coffee mutants, the associated and undesirable precocious flower opening characteristic provides the first functional proof of the role of colleters and their exudate in protecting flowers against exposure to dry atmospheres and acting as an adhesive to keep the petals united until anthesis. Additionally, although not reported here, we observed a lack of exudate on leaf buds, suggesting that the mutation in Decaffito might also affect the production and release of exudate in the colleters in different plant organs.This work was financially supported by <grant-sponsor xlink:type="simple">Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo</grant-sponsor> (FAPESP—grants <grant-num xlink:type="simple">2005/59775-5</grant-num> and <grant-num xlink:type="simple">2008/54040-5</grant-num>).All the authors contributed to a similar extent overall.None declared.P.M. thanks Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq-Brazil) for a research fellowship.
