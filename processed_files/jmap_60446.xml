Vegetation height estimation from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and National Elevation DatasetsA study was conducted to determine the feasibility of obtaining estimates of vegetation canopy height from digital elevation data collected during the 2000 Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The SRTM sensor mapped 80% of the Earth's land mass with a C-band Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) instrument, producing the most complete digital surface map of Earth. Due to the relatively short wavelength (5.6 cm) of the SRTM instrument, the majority of incoming electromagnetic energy is reflected by scatterers located within the vegetation canopy at heights well above the Ã¢Â€Âœbald-EarthÃ¢Â€Â surface. Interferometric SAR theory provides a basis for properly identifying and accounting for the dependence of this scattering phase center height on both instrument and target characteristics, including relative and absolute vertical error and vegetation structural attributes.An investigation to quantify the magnitude of the vertical error component was conducted using SRTM data from two vegetation-free areas in Iowa and North Dakota, revealing absolute errors of Ã¢ÂˆÂ’4.0 and Ã¢ÂˆÂ’1.1 m, respectively. It was also shown that the relative vertical error due to phase noise can be reduced significantly through sample averaging. The relative error range for the Iowa site was reduced from 13 to 4 m and for the North Dakota site from 7 to 3 m after averaging of 50 samples. Following error reduction, it was demonstrated that the SRTM elevation data can be successfully correlated via linear regression models with ground-measured canopy heights acquired during the general mission timeframe from test sites located in Georgia and California. Prior to outlier removal and phase noise reduction, initial adjusted r2 values for the Georgia and California sites were 0.15 and 0.20, respectively. Following outlier analysis and averaging of at least 20 SRTM pixels per observation, adjusted r2 values for the Georgia and California sites improved to 0.79 (rmse=1.1 m) and 0.75 (rmse=4.5 m), respectively. An independent validation of a novel bin-based modeling strategy designed for reducing phase noise in sample plot data confirmed both the robustness of the California model (adjusted r2=0.74) as well as the capacity of the binning strategy to produce stable models suitable for inversion (validated rmse=4.1 m). The results suggest that a minimum mapping unit of approximately 1.8 ha is appropriate for SRTM-based vegetation canopy height mapping.
