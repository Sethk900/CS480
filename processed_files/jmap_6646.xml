The Fieldes and Perrott field test as an aid to identification for podzol B horizonsThe Fieldes and Perrott test for allophane was assessed as an aid to identifying podzol horizons. The test was compared to the chemical criteria for podzol B horizons on 51 B horizon samples collected in the southern Cape. In 37 of the samples the results of the test agreed with the chemical criteria. Only one podzol horizon did not test positively but many non-podzol horizons tested positively. This positive test should be discounted if the colour value is greater than or equal to five. The test is shown to be a useful aid to identification of podzols but has limitations and in many cases classification would need to be confirmed by laboratory analysis.
