Five new species of Enchytraeidae (Annelida: Clitellata) from Mediterranean woodlands of Italy and reaffirmed validity of Achaeta etrusca, Fridericia bulbosa and F. mirafloresFive new enchytraeid species are described from Mediterranean woodland habitats of Italy: Achaeta borbonica sp. nov., Achaeta giustii sp. nov., Fridericia bargaglii sp. nov., Fridericia meridiana sp. nov. and F. rara sp. nov. New evidence is presented to confirm the validity of Achaeta etrusca Rota, 1995, contrary to its synonymization with Achaeta iberica Graefe, 1989 (unlike the latter, Achaeta etrusca has knob-like inward-bulging glands). The name Fridericia bulbosa is retained for animals fitting the original description of Neoenchytraeus bulbosus Rosa, 1887, challenging the view that later confusion makes it a nomen dubium. Consistency between taxonomic procedures also suggests to retain Fridericia miraflores Sesma and DÃ³zsa-Farkas, 1993 as valid, contrary to its synonymization with Fridericia sylvatica Healy, 1979 (a taxon not type based and poorly described, thus impossible to be conclusively identified).http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:526FC344-E093-4106-B8D6-07DC685ADC51
