Leveling Process of Annual Budgetary Requirements for Pavement PreservationAbstractThis paper presents a model for leveling annual budgetary requirements (ABRs) for pavement preservation programs over a multiyear analysis period. Given the information such as the candidate pavement preservation projects, associated costs, application years, and time floats to be shifted, the presented leveling process adjusts the application years of the projects to minimize the variance among ABRs. The minimum moment method is modified considering the dummy period that is to shift preservation projects within their time floats and additional constraints for the leveling process. To validate the leveling model, this study uses Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) pavement preservation projects as a case study that consists of a total of 193 projects over a three-year analysis period between 2010 and 2012. As a result of the case study, the leveling process provides relatively consistent ABRs over the three-year analysis period for INDOT. Therefore, the major contributions of this research will assist public agencies in: (1) identifying the consistent budgetary requirements to be dedicated to the pavement preservation program, and (2) establishing a long-term budgetary goal to include all needs of the pavement preservation program at the network level.
