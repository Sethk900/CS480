First records of Raja (dipturus) trachyderma Krefft & Stehmann, 1975 from the Southeastern pacific off Chile, with first descriptions of its clasper characters and additional skeletal and morphological details (Pisces, Rajiformes, Rajidae)A first complete description of mature specimens of Raja (Dipturus) trachyderma Krefft & Stehmann, 1975 is given, based on material from the Southeastern Pacific off Chile obtained at 150â€“450 m depth. The original description is complemented mainly regarding clasper characters, scapulocoracoid, and details of cranial and pelvis morphology. Features are presented to distinguish adult Raja (Dipturus) flavirostris of about 100 cm TL from immature R. (D.) trachyderma of the same size, both occurring almost sympatrically in Chilean waters.
