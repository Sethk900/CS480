Egg production of two sympatric species of Hyalella Smith, 1874 (Crustacea, Amphipoda, Dogielinotidae) in aquaculture ponds in southern BrazilThis study tests the hypothesis that sympatric species of Hyalella may show different reproductive strategies that permit their coexistence. Ovigerous females were collected monthly with nets during a 1-year period in two aquaculture trout ponds in Vale das Trutas, São José dos Ausentes County, southern Brazil. In both species there was a decrease in the number of embryos in the brood pouch during embryonic development, and an increase in egg volume. However, the two species differed in the body size of ovigerous females, number of eggs and juveniles per female, brood mortality rate, egg size and hatching size of juveniles. Egg production continued throughout the year, with the highest number of eggs produced during winter and spring by Hyalella pleoacuta, and winter, spring and autumn by Hyalella castroi. These differences in the reproductive traits of species of Hyalella may permit their coexistence in nature.
