Site and refuge use by giant river otters (Pteronura brasiliensis) in the Western Brazilian AmazoniaGiant river otters are endangered and knowledge about this species is incomplete, especially in the Brazilian Amazonia, which holds large populations of the species. In order to improve our knowledge for species conservation, we present data on site and refuge use by giant river otters in the Amanã Reserve, Brazilian Amazonia. During 40 sampling trips (October 2004 to September 2008) we recorded information and the physical characteristics of 193 campsites, 182 dens and 62 resting sites. Animals were site-selective, preferentially building their dens, campsites and resting sites at < 2 m from the water, on slopes < 45°, and avoiding using water bodies < 1 m deep. The information presented here stresses the importance of river margins for giant river otters, indicating that these areas are key habitats for their conservation.
