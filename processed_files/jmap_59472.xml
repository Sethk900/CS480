Data Management Plan for PhD Thesis "Climatic Limitation of Alien Weeds in New Zealand: Enhancing Species Distribution Models with Field Data"This Data Management Plan (DMP) was created using the DMPTool. It describes all data collected and created as part of the recently submitted PhD thesis of the corresponding author, "Climatic Limitation of Alien Weeds in New Zealand: Enhancing Species Distribution Models with Field Data", undertaken at the Bio Protection Research Centre, Lincoln University, New Zealand.
