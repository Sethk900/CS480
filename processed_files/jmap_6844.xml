Longevity, Demography and Sex-Specific Growth of the Pampa de Achala Toad, Bufo achalensis CEI, 1972The demography and life history parameters of the neotropical Bufo achalensis, an endemic toad of the Pampa de Achala, Sierras Grandes de Cordoba, Argentina, were studied in 13 activity periods between 1970/71 and 1998/99. We used phalange bones for skeletochronological age estimation and to assess annual growth rates in 243 individuals. Maximum longevity was 11 years, and sexual maturity was attained at an age of 2–4 years. Reproductive females were on average 4–8 mm smaller than males of the same age. There is no indication that the population of B. achalensis is declining as observed in several neotropical amphibian species.
