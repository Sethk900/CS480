Trachymolgus purpureus sp. n., an armored snout mite (Acari, Bdellidae) from the Ozark highlands: morphology, development, and key to Trachymolgus BerleseAbstract Trachymolgus purpureus Fisher & Dowling sp. n. is described from the Ozark highlands of North America. A diversity of imaging techniques are used to illustrate the species including low-temperature scanning electron microscopy (LT-SEM), stereomicrography, compound light micrography, and digitally created line drawings. Developmental stages (larva, nymphs, and adult) and morphology are illustrated and discussed, and terminological corrections are suggested. Trachymolgus recki Gomelauri, 1961 is regarded as being described from tritonymphs. A key to Trachymolgus is presented.
