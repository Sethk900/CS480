Genome downsizing and karyotype constancy in diploid and polyploid congeners: a model of genome size variationIn several genus evolutionary chromosome change involves variation in DNA amount in diploids and genome downsizing in polyploids. The constancy of bimodal karyotypes, even with changes in ploidy level and DNA content per basic genome indicate that the distribution of DNA within the complement is not at random and suggest the presence of mechanisms selecting for constancy, or against changes, in the karyotype morphology. Evolutionary chromosome change involves significant variation in DNA amount in diploids and genome downsizing in polyploids. Genome size and karyotype parameters of Hippeastrum species with different ploidy level were analysed. In Hippeastrum, polyploid species show less DNA content per basic genome than diploid species. The rate of variation is lower at higher ploidy levels. All the species have a basic number x = 11 and bimodal karyotypes. The basic karyotypes consist of four short metacentric chromosomes and seven large chromosomes (submetacentric and subtelocentric). The bimodal karyotype is preserved maintaining the relative proportions of members of the haploid chromosome set, even in the presence of genome downsizing. The constancy of the karyotype is maintained because changes in DNA amount are proportional to the length of the whole-chromosome complement and vary independently in the long and short sets of chromosomes. This karyotype constancy in taxa of Hippeastrum with different genome size and ploidy level indicates that the distribution of extra DNA within the complement is not at random and suggests the presence of mechanisms selecting for constancy, or against changes, in karyotype morphology.
