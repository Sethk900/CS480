A new genus of Atlantic octocorals (Octocorallia: Gorgoniidae): systematics of gorgoniids with asymmetric scleritesGorgonian corals from the families Gorgoniidae and Plexauridae are among the most abundant and diverse shallowâ€water cnidarians found along tropical and temperate Atlantic coasts and reefs. Some morphological traits in the Gorgoniidae comprise a taxonomic challenge due to their morphological plasticity as well as a lack of discrete character states among most genera. Some gorgoniids have asymmetrical sclerites in the surface coenenchyme, a character trait that consists of a continuum among several genera and can cause confusion with members of the family Plexauridae. The collection of a unique gorgoniid in Tobago (Trinidad and Tobago), which contains this trait but also maintains affinities to many different genera, stimulated a wider morphological comparison of gorgoniids using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Using the morphology of asymmetrical sclerites, gorgoniids could be grouped in four monophyletic clades that were compatible with recent molecular phylogenies and provide a provisional subfamilial classification: (1) a derived clade including gorgoniids with scaphoid sclerites, comprising the reef fauna from the western Atlantic (e.g. Gorgonia, Pseudopterogorgia [Â =Â  Antillogorgia], Pterogorgia, and Phyllogorgia); (2) a related group with taxa containing capstan sclerites including genera with short capstans and/or diskâ€spindles sclerites such as Pacifogorgia and Leptogorgia (Â =Â  Lophogorgia); (3) a clade of gorgoniids with asymmetrical spiny sclerites including the Atlantic genus Muriceopsis and the Indopacific Pinnigorgia together with the distant single species from the new genus and species Tobagogorgia hardyi (it is worth noting that Muriceopsis was previously classified in the Plexauridae, but there is overwhelming molecular support that groups it with the Gorgoniidae and morphological evidence that suggests affinity with Pinnigorgia); and finally (4) a basal clade with long and spiny spindles, which includes some African species such as Filigorgia angolana and F. schoutedeni as well as other new combinations (all species previously classified as Leptogorgia but not phylogenetically related). The combined set of sclerites of Tobagogorgia (e.g. both asymmetrical and irregularly bent spindles) separates it from the diagnostic characters of related genera such as Muriceopsis and Pinnigorgia. The latter two genera are also profusely branched, including pinnate patterns, whereas T. hardyi has only one or two branches. Externally, T. hardyi looks like some Leptogorgia colonies that branch minimally but it is clear that the sclerites are very different and thus also their phylogenetic divergence.
