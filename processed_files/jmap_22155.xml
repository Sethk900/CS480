New subgenus and new species of Oriental Omophorus (Coleoptera, Curculionidae, Molytinae, Metatygini)Abstract The genus Omophorus Schoenherr, 1835 is recorded for the first time from the Oriental Region and a new subgenus and species, Omophorus (Sinomophorus subgen. n.) rongshu sp. n. is described from Yunnan province (P.R. China). The new subgenus differs from the subgenus Omophorus by the longer antennal club, the bifid vestiture of the ventral parts, the elongate subtrapezoidal scutellum, the very small size of sclerotizations in the endophallus, the absence of styli in the ovipositor and the absence of the spiculum ventrale on the VIII female sternite, and from the subgenus Pangomophorus Voss, 1960 by the developed metatibial uncus and the lack of a subhumeral tubercle. A detailed description and figures are provided to allow interpretation of characters in ongoing phylogenetic analyses.
