CaliforniaEmpirical support for a despotic distribution in a California Spotted Owl populationUnderstanding interactions among site occupancy, reproduction, vegetation, and disturbance for threatened species can improve conservation measures, because important aspects of vegetation and disturbances may be identified and managed. We used 9 yr of survey data collected at 168 sites to investigate dynamic site occupancy and reproduction in a declining population of California Spotted Owls (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Strix occidentalis</named-content> occidentalis</italic>) in southern California, USA. We used multistate models to examine the relationship among owl site occupancy, reproduction, high-severity wildland fire, and postfire logging, while accounting for variation in vegetation characteristics and variation in detectability. Both occupancy and reproduction were positively correlated with successful reproduction in the previous year. Tree cover (ha) in a site's 203-ha core area also was positively correlated with both occupancy and reproduction. We detected no effect of disturbance covariates on reproduction, given that a site was occupied. Fire and logging covariates were both negatively correlated with the probability of site occupancy, and the effect sizes of these disturbances were large in sites that were occupied by owls that were nonreproductive the previous year (reduced 0.19 by fire and 0.26 by post-fire logging), but small in sites that were occupied by owls that were reproductive the previous year (reduced 0.02 by fire and 0.03 by postfire logging). This study illustrates the important contribution of consistently occupied and productive breeding sites to this population of Spotted Owls, and demonstrates that both occupancy and reproduction at these productive sites exhibited negligible effects from disturbances. Our results suggest that sites with recent owl reproduction and sites with more tree cover in this study area should receive enhanced protection from management actions that modify vegetation utilized by Spotted Owls.Entender las interacciones entre la ocupaci&oacute;n de sitios, la reproducci&oacute;n, la vegetaci&oacute;n y los disturbios puede mejorar las medidas de conservaci&oacute;n de las aves en peligro ya que importantes aspectos de la vegetaci&oacute;n y de los disturbios pueden ser identificados y manejados. Empleamos 9 a&ntilde;os de datos de muestreo colectados en 168 sitos para investigar la din&aacute;mica de ocupaci&oacute;n de sitios y la reproducci&oacute;n en una poblaci&oacute;n en disminuci&oacute;n de <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Strix occidentalis</named-content> occidentalis</italic> en el sur de California. Empleamos modelos de estado m&uacute;ltiple para examinar la relaci&oacute;n entre la ocupaci&oacute;n de sitios, la reproducci&oacute;n, los fuegos de gran intensidad de ambientes silvestres y el aprovechamiento forestal post-incendio, mientras consideramos las variaciones en las caracter&iacute;sticas de la vegetaci&oacute;n y en la detectabilidad. La ocupaci&oacute;n y la reproducci&oacute;n se correlacionaron positivamente con una reproducci&oacute;n exitosa en el a&ntilde;o anterior. Las hect&aacute;reas de cobertura arb&oacute;rea en un sitio de 203 ha de &aacute;rea n&uacute;cleo tambi&eacute;n se correlacionaron positivamente con la ocupaci&oacute;n y la reproducci&oacute;n. Considerando que un sitio estaba ocupado, no detectamos un efecto de las covariables del disturbio sobre la reproducci&oacute;n. Las covariables de fuego y aprovechamiento forestal estuvieron negativamente correlacionadas con la probabilidad de ocupaci&oacute;n del sitio, y los efectos del tama&ntilde;o de estos disturbios fueron grandes en los sitios que no fueron usados para reproducci&oacute;n en el a&ntilde;o anterior (reducido 0.19 por fuego y 0.26 por aprovechamiento forestal post-incendio), pero fueron peque&ntilde;os en los sitios usados previamente para reproducci&oacute;n (reducido 0.02 por fuego y 0.03 por aprovechamiento forestal post-incendio).

Multistate modeling provides a useful measure of productivity by estimating the probability that young are produced at a site, while accounting for imperfect detectability and examining the effects of a site's state during the previous year: (1) vacant, (2) occupied with no young, or (3) occupied with young. Within this framework, we examined the effects of vegetation and disturbance interactions on site occupancy and reproduction for an important indicator of late-seral forests, the California Spotted Owl (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Strix occidentalis</named-content> occidentalis</italic>), in southern California, USA.Site occupancy and reproduction of California Spotted Owls are influenced by site-specific vegetation characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Blakesley2">Blakesley et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Seamans2">Seamans and Guti&eacute;rrez 2007</xref>). Wildland fire is a major natural disturbance that has affected forests within the range of the Spotted Owl for millennia, with varying pattern, frequency, and intensity across forest types, regions, and time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Swanson1">Swanson et al. 2011</xref>). High-severity fires&mdash;also called stand-replacement or crown fires&mdash;cause widespread mortality of existing vegetation and result in a forest structure no longer dominated by live trees but by herbs, shrubs, and dead trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Swanson1">Swanson et al. 2011</xref>). Only high-severity fires burn intensely enough to initiate ecological succession and restore essential habitat for a variety of fire-dependent and early-seral-stage species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Smucker1">Smucker et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Kotliar1">Kotliar et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Hutto1">Hutto 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Fontaine1">Fontaine et al. 2009</xref>), but data are scarce regarding the specific effects of this type of fire on wildlife characteristically associated with older forests, such as the Spotted Owl. Furthermore, high-severity burned forest is frequently logged&mdash;often called &lsquo;salvage logging'&mdash;which has additional effects on wildlife (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Lindenmayer1">Lindenmayer et al. 2004</xref>).Vegetation disturbances such as timber harvest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Seamans2">Seamans and Guti&eacute;rrez 2007</xref>) and high-severity fire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Lee1">Lee et al. 2013</xref>) may adversely affect the site occupancy dynamics of California Spotted Owls when alterations of forest within a territory exceed a certain threshold. Alternatively, these disturbances may have positive effects on occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Lee2">Lee et al. 2012</xref>) or reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Franklin2">Franklin et al. 2000</xref>) by creating heterogeneity, such as complex early seral stands that are used for foraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Bond2">Bond et al. 2009</xref>) interspersed with older forest stands that are required for nesting and roosting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Gutierrez3">Guti&eacute;rrez et al. 1992</xref>).Site occupancy and reproduction also could be correlated with the state of the site in the previous year. The probability of a site being occupied or supporting reproduction in a given year could be lower when young were produced the previous year because of &lsquo;resource depletion' in the territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Carey1">Carey et al. 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Ganey1">Ganey et al. 2014</xref>). Conversely, the probability of a site being occupied or supporting reproduction in a given year could be greater when young were produced the previous year if the site's capability to support occupancy and reproduction (&lsquo;reproductive capability') is consistently high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Przybylo1">Przybylo et al. 2001</xref>). The effect of the previous year's state also could vary among years in a complex interaction of state and time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-MacKenzie2">MacKenzie et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-MacKenzie3">2010</xref>), or could be absent (no effect of previous year's state).We investigated dynamic site occupancy and reproduction of California Spotted Owls over a 9-yr period in relation to site-specific vegetation and topographic characteristics, and in response to the disturbances of high-severity wildland fire and postfire logging, in the San Bernardino and San Jacinto mountains of southern California, where populations have declined over the past 2 decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-LaHaye2">LaHaye et al. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-LaHaye5">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Lee1">Lee et al. 2013</xref>). We examined the influence of site- and year-specific covariates of the amount and structure of vegetation, which varied spatially because of climate and geography and temporally because of natural and human-caused disturbances. We performed multistate model selection and estimated the dynamic probability of annual occupancy and reproduction by Spotted Owls in known sites according to the reproductive state of the owls in the site in the previous year, and according to dynamic site-specific vegetation disturbance covariates that we used to classify sites as: (1) unburned, (2) burned and not logged postfire, or (3) burned and logged postfire. All burned sites were surveyed before and after fires, so that prefire occupancy and reproduction data existed for a before&ndash;after control&ndash;impact analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Popescu1">Popescu et al. 2012</xref>).We did not know which owls occupied a given site in our study because birds were not individually marked. Thus, herein we consider occupancy, reproduction, and effects of previous year's state to be characteristics of the site, and these were our metrics of the site's capability to support reproduction in relation to disturbance covariates.The San Bernardino Mountains (SBM) and San Jacinto Mountains (SJM) are located ~140&ndash;150 km east of Los Angeles, California. The climate is Mediterranean, with most precipitation (500&ndash;1,000 mm per year) falling during the winter as rain at lower elevations and as rain and snow at higher elevations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Minnich1">Minnich 1988</xref>).In southern California, Spotted Owls inhabit isolated upper-elevation (915&ndash;1,525 m) forests surrounded by lower-elevation desert and semidesert vegetation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Gutierrez1">Guti&eacute;rrez and Pritchard 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Gutierrez3">Guti&eacute;rrez et al. 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-LaHaye2">LaHaye et al. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-LaHaye3">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-LaHaye4">2001</xref>). Forest fires in these southern Californian forests occur largely as a result of human-caused ignition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Halsey1">Halsey 2005</xref>) and typically burn in a mosaic of severities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Weatherspoon1">Weatherspoon et al. 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Stephenson1">Stephenson and Calcarone 1999</xref>), with the largest high-severity fires burning under extreme Santa Ana weather conditions typical of the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Keeley1">Keeley et al. 2009</xref>). Fire has been proposed as a factor in the regional Spotted Owl population decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-LaHaye1">LaHaye and Guti&eacute;rrez 2005</xref>), although empirical evidence is lacking.In the period 2003&ndash;2011, a large proportion (0.42) of Spotted Owl breeding sites in the SBM were affected by wildland fire, which occurred during drought conditions and warmer-than-average temperatures. Two large fires in 2003 and 2007, and several smaller fires during this period, burned through 71 of 181 owl sites that were regularly monitored by U.S. Forest Service biologists. Postfire logging occurred on a subset of 21 sites, and provided us with the opportunity to examine the effects of high-severity fire and postfire logging on Spotted Owl dynamic breeding site occupancy and reproduction from 2003 to 2011.We defined an owl site as a distinct geographical area deemed to be occupied by seeing or hearing a single or pair of territorial Spotted Owls during surveys from 1989 to 2001. From 1989 to 2001, 181 California Spotted Owl sites within the boundaries of the San Bernardino National Forest in the SBM and SJM (2,140 km<sup>2</sup>) were identified by annually surveying all forested stands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-LaHaye5">LaHaye et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Gutierrez2">Guti&eacute;rrez et al. 2011</xref>). For our study, each year from 2003 through 2011, the U.S. Forest Service attempted to survey as many known Spotted Owl sites as possible from March 1 to August 31, following standardized methods described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Forsman1">Forsman (1983)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Franklin1">Franklin et al. (1996)</xref>. The U.S. Forest Service provided us with the raw survey data, which we then used to construct an occupancy history database. Because we did not collect data ourselves, we acknowledge that there may be problems with the data that are unknown to us. We analyzed the data from sites surveyed for &gt;2 consecutive years from 2003 to 2011 (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 168 sites). Our population of interest was historical Spotted Owl sites that were subsequently burned (or not burned) by fire, so it was appropriate to use data from sites where occupancy status had been previously established, rather than from randomly selected sites where previous occupancy status was unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-MacKenzie1">MacKenzie and Royle 2005</xref>).Within each year, 2 types of surveys were conducted: (1) presence&ndash;absence surveys to initially locate owls in an area, and (2) reproductive surveys to find roosts and nests and to assess the reproductive status of owls detected during presence&ndash;absence surveys. All surveys were separated by &gt;48 hr. The presence&ndash;absence surveys were conducted by imitating Spotted Owl vocalizations between dusk and dawn from a series of fixed calling stations. If a Spotted Owl responded during a nighttime survey, the presence&ndash;absence survey ended, and dusk or dawn reproductive surveys were conducted. Reproduction was estimated by feeding owls live mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Forsman1">Forsman 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Franklin1">Franklin et al. 1996</xref>). Successful reproduction was documented when at least 1 owlet was observed outside the nest. A maximum of 6 presence&ndash;absence surveys and 4 reproductive surveys were conducted at Spotted Owl sites every year.The maximum number of surveys at any site in a year was 8, but both the median and mode number of visits across all sites each year was 6, so we truncated all within-year survey histories at 6 surveys for this analysis to reduce the number of missing observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Olson1">Olson et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Kroll1">Kroll et al. 2010</xref>).We quantified site-specific vegetation covariates as hectares within a 203-ha circular &lsquo;core area' around the most recently used Spotted Owl nest tree location or roost centroid (geometric mean of roost locations) for the following variables: total tree cover; amount of coniferous, hardwood, and old-growth (&ge;5 trees ha<sup>&minus;1</sup> with crown diameter &gt;9 m) forest; and area of riparian vegetation. The core area was approximately half of the average breeding-season home-range size for California Spotted Owls in the SBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Zimmerman1">Zimmerman et al. 2001</xref>), and was intended to represent the area of most concentrated use by Spotted Owls during the breeding season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Blakesley2">Blakesley et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Lee2">Lee et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Lee1">2013</xref>). We also assigned a site-specific topographic covariate for elevation at the nest tree or roost centroid for each site. <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-t01">Table 1</xref> shows the definitions of our temporal and vegetation covariates.Temporal and vegetation covariates used in modeling detection, occupancy, and reproduction of California Spotted Owls in the San Bernardino Mountains, California, USA, 2003&ndash;2011. Predicted effects were: x &equals; no prediction, but effect could be present; &plus; &equals; positive correlation predicted between covariate and parameter; &ndash; &equals; negative correlation predicted; &plus;/&ndash; &equals; either positive or negative correlation predicted. If predicted effect is blank, the covariate was not modeled for that parameter.We used a landscape-level vegetation map developed by GIS analysts from the U.S. Forest Service's Adaptive Management Services Enterprise Team (AMSET). The base map consisted of a layer of joined and orthorectified 1-m resolution infrared aerial photographs taken of the entire San Bernardino National Forest in 2002. Vegetation was mapped within the Spotted Owl core area circles with a minimum map unit of ~2 ha.We defined burned Spotted Owl sites as those in which the core area was inside or included the perimeter of one of the fires. M. Borchert and C. Hanson provided us with vegetation change data for our analyses. M. Borchert determined the number of hectares of tree cover that burned at high severity by overlaying burn severity and vegetation maps to quantify change in tree cover resulting from fire. High-severity fire induced changes in dominant vegetation by killing &ge;75&percnt; of trees. C. Hanson quantified postfire logging using aerial photographs, obtained from Google Earth, by imposing a grid of 1-ha cells in the 203-ha circle around the nests or roost centroids and estimating the amount of the circle affected by extensive (i.e. clear-cut) postfire tree removal.To confirm the GIS base map's accuracy in representing the vegetation variables in our analysis, we used field data collected by AMSET biologists within 81 variable-radius plots in 15 randomly selected owl sites. For each owl site, 6 plots were located at fixed distances in randomly selected directions from the most recently occupied nest tree. Plots ranged from a minimum distance of 50 m to a maximum distance of 500 m from the nest. At each plot, AMSET biologists estimated the number of large trees per acre and percent tree cover, and we compared these values (after conversion to hectares) with classifications of those covariates at the same locations from the landscape-level map. We considered percent tree cover to be accurate if the map's estimate was within 10&percnt; of the ground-plot estimate. Producer's accuracy was 63&percnt; for large tree density and 68&percnt; for percent tree cover, and user's accuracy was 58&percnt; for large tree density and 64&percnt; for percent tree cover. Our map accuracy was somewhat lower, but still comparable to other remotely sensed maps used to analyze Spotted Owl habitats (e.g., accuracy for mature conifer forests &equals; 50&ndash;84&percnt;, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Clark1">Clark 2007</xref>; and 50&ndash;71&percnt;, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Williams1">Williams et al. 2011</xref>).We used raw survey data to compile occupancy histories for 168 California Spotted Owl sites. Our 9-yr dataset included 97 unburned control sites and 71 burned sites, of which a subset of 21 were logged postfire. We created occupancy histories in which each survey of each site was coded according to observed state: &lsquo;0&prime; for no Spotted Owls observed, &lsquo;1&prime; for &gt;0 adults observed, and &lsquo;2&rsquo; for &gt;0 owlets observed outside the nest. We used program Presence 4.0 (USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, Laurel, Maryland, USA) to fit models and estimate parameters from occupancy histories following methods developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-MacKenzie2">MacKenzie et al.

Model selection proceeded as follows (a full table of model selection is provided in <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1650/CONDOR-14-197.1.s1" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary Material Table S1</ext-link>):First, we tested for within-year, survey-specific temporal variability in detection probabilities (<italic>p1</italic>, <italic>p2</italic>, and &delta;), while holding occupancy and reproduction in their fully time-dependent forms (<italic>state</italic> &ast; <italic>year</italic>). Detection probabilities could vary because of survey-specific differences in survey staff, weather conditions, and other unmeasured factors.

If site occupancy and reproduction probabilities varied because of previous state, such that nonreproductive &gt; reproductive, then &lsquo;resource depletion' would be supported.

We ranked 6 models of fire and postfire logging effects. We modeled fire effects as a postfire change in intercept (<italic>burn</italic>), and with continuous covariates of vegetation change from high-severity fire as linear (<italic>burn</italic> &plus; <italic>hisev</italic>) and quadratic (<italic>burn</italic> &plus; <italic>hisev</italic><sup>2</sup>) functions of the hectares of trees killed by fire within the core area.

All fires burned after surveys ended for the year, so fire did not affect within-season conditions in this study.Linear and quadratic covariates of tree cover burned at high severity were previously shown to affect California Spotted Owl site occupancy in southern California (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Lee1">Lee et al. 2013</xref>).

The effect of a specific covariate was inferred to be significant when the 95&percnt; confidence interval of the beta coefficient did not include zero.The mean number of Spotted Owl sites surveyed each year (2003&ndash;2011) that had also been surveyed in the previous year was 76 for unburned sites (SD &equals; 24, minimum &equals; 39) and 52 for burned sites (SD &equals; 16, minimum &equals; 31).

The top-ranked model of fire and logging effects on reproduction indicated no significant effects of either covariate (<ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1650/CONDOR-14-197.1.s2" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary Material Table S2</ext-link>).

This result supports predictions from the &lsquo;reproductive capability' hypothesis. We interpret this to indicate the presence of sites that were consistently occupied by successfully reproductive owls over time. It could be that variation in geography or vegetation influenced a site's habitat and prey base and led to these sites being consistently occupied and productive regardless of the reproductive abilities of the individual owls present, or that individuals with high reproductive abilities occupied the sites with the best habitat and that this combination of individual and habitat attributes led to consistent occupancy and reproduction. Our inferences cannot extend to individual owls when our sampling unit was the site, but one can expect positive correlations between individual and site reproductive capability when intrinsically superior individuals settle preferentially in the sites with the best habitat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Fretwell1">Fretwell 1972</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Lomnicki1">Lomnicki 1988</xref>). Additionally, many avian species, including California Spotted Owls, exhibit a pattern of greater fidelity to breeding sites for individuals that were reproductively successful than for those that were not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Greenwood1">Greenwood and Harvey 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Blakesley1">Blakesley et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Gutierrez2">Guti&eacute;rrez et al. 2011</xref>). Our methods attempted to account for variation in site vegetation characteristics while examining evidence for &lsquo;reproductive capability' vs. &lsquo;resource depletion' effects, but our GIS map for vegetation was not highly accurate. Thus, the &lsquo;reproductive capability' effect could result from variation in site-specific characteristics that we could not account for with our vegetation covariates.Our results differ from those of 2 similar studies of a population of California Spotted Owls in the central Sierra Nevada (Eldorado study area), where previous year's reproductive state was not an important determinant of occupancy or reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-MacKenzie2">MacKenzie et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-MacKenzie3">2010</xref>). Our methods were based directly upon the methods of those 2 studies, so comparisons are valid. Differences in habitat&ndash;demography relationships, mediated by the different vegetation, climate, and anthropogenic impacts in the 2 regions, could explain the observed patterns. One possibility may be that the Sierra Nevada population is at or above carrying capacity while the southern California population is below carrying capacity, in which case we would expect demographic patterns to be obscured in the Sierra Nevada relative to southern California (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Pulliam1">Pulliam 2000</xref>). Spotted Owl populations have declined in the Sierra Nevada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Tempel1">Tempel and Guti&eacute;rrez 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Conner1">Conner et al. 2013</xref>), but it is likely that the amount of habitat has also declined because of extensive commercial logging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Seamans2">Seamans and Guti&eacute;rrez 2007</xref>), therefore the Sierra Nevada population could be at or above carrying capacity while also at a substantially lower population size than previously documented. California Spotted Owl populations in southern California have declined as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-LaHaye2">LaHaye et al. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-LaHaye5">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Lee1">Lee et al. 2013</xref>), but forests here are much less affected by recent commercial logging, and more affected by drought, water diversions, and urbanization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-LaHaye1">LaHaye and Guti&eacute;rrez 2005</xref>).Site-specific vegetation covariates, including our disturbance variables of interest, high-severity fire and postfire logging, were important factors affecting detection and misclassification probabilities. It is now well established that vegetation and other site-specific covariates should be included in model selection procedures for detection and other &lsquo;nuisance' probabilities, in order to produce unbiased estimates of occupancy and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Popescu1">Popescu et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Lee2">Lee et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Lee1">2013</xref>). It is particularly important to examine the influence of a study's main effect of interest upon &lsquo;nuisance' parameters if researchers hope to produce robust results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Popescu1">Popescu et al. 2012</xref>).In southern California, we found that high-severity fire and postfire logging were correlated with a significant reduction in Spotted Owl site occupancy probability, but that the negative effects were small in sites that supported reproductive owls the previous year (reduced 0.02 by fire and 0.03 by postfire logging, respectively) and pronounced in sites that were occupied by nonreproductive owls the previous year (reduced 0.19 by fire and 0.26 by postfire logging; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-f03">Figure 3</xref>). As with the influence of prior reproductive state, the effects of high-severity fire on Spotted Owl site occupancy also differed between southern California and the Sierra Nevada. Burned sites in the Sierra Nevada had slightly greater occupancy relative to unburned sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Lee2">Lee et al. 2012</xref>). Although the mean percentage of high-severity burned tree cover in owl core areas was similar between the 2 regions, owl sites in the Sierra Nevada had substantially greater amounts of prefire tree cover and thus retained more postfire unburned or lightly burned closed-canopy nesting and roosting habitat, potentially explaining the differences in the effects of fire on occupancy between the 2 areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Lee2">Lee et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Lee1">2013</xref>). Further, vegetation and climate differ substantially between the regions.Reproduction in occupied sites in our study area was unaffected by high-severity fire and postfire logging during the study period. Our results agree with previous studies on reproduction of Spotted Owls after fire, indicating that productivity in occupied burned sites is no different from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Jenness1">Jenness et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Clark1">Clark 2007</xref>), or may be greater than, productivity in occupied unburned sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Bond1">Bond et al. 2002</xref>). Our multistate modeling using 9 yr of owl survey data for 168 sites in 2 mountain ranges that experienced multiple fires corroborates results from earlier studies in other regions. Our and other studies suggest that, in Spotted Owl breeding sites with habitat characteristics that support occupancy, reproductive rates are similar in both burned and unburned areas.We found no significant effect of elevation on reproduction, but elevation was found to be a significant factor in previous studies of Spotted Owl reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-LaHaye3">LaHaye et al. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Blakesley2">Blakesley et al. 2005</xref>). The number of young fledged per pair could have been greater at lower elevations in our study, but our multistate modeling quantified reproduction at a site as binomial (0 or 1). Thus, the probability of successfully reproducing at lower-elevation sites is not greater than at higher-elevation sites, but more juveniles per pair apparently are fledged at lower elevations in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-LaHaye3">LaHaye et al. 1997</xref>). These lower-elevation owl sites were more vulnerable to high-severity fire during our study period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Lee1">Lee et al. 2013</xref>). Therefore, we recommend strengthening efforts to reduce human-caused ignitions at the wildland&ndash;urban interface in the lower elevations of the San Bernardino and San Jacinto mountains to reduce the potential for high-severity fire to exceed critical thresholds in owl sites.This study illustrates the important contribution of productive breeding sites to this population of Spotted Owls. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Zimmerman2">Zimmerman et al. (2003)</xref> noted that Spotted Owls in our study population tended to occupy sites where they were more likely to replace themselves. Although fire and postfire logging covariates were associated with reduced site occupancy, the effect sizes of these disturbances in the sites where owls reproduced the previous year were small. We were unable to quantify whether owls rearranged themselves according to an ideal despotic distribution after disturbance because we did not have data on individual survival and fecundity (sensu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Franklin2">Franklin et al. 2000</xref>), but the greater overall productivity at sites where young were produced the previous year compared with sites where breeding did not occur, regardless of disturbance, indicates that some sites were more important than others.The majority of Spotted Owl core areas in the SBM and SJM experienced high-severity fires that were below the critical threshold that reduced occupancy (&gt;50 ha forested area in the 203-ha core), even during this period of extreme drought and elevated fire activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Lee1">Lee et al. 2013</xref>). Severe fire that burned owl core areas throughout the Sierra Nevada from 2000 to 2007 also did not reduce site occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Lee2">Lee et al. 2012</xref>), and severely burned forests in the southern Sierra Nevada that were not logged after fire had a greater probability of use by foraging Spotted Owls than unburned forests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Bond2">Bond et al. 2009</xref>). Therefore, the occurrence of high-severity forest fire does not necessarily translate into adverse effects on California Spotted Owls.In contrast, prior studies have demonstrated that Spotted Owls and other species have been adversely affected by logging projects intended to reduce the future risk of high-severity fire, including postfire logging and green-tree thinning. California Spotted Owls in the Sierra Nevada avoided foraging and showed reduced occupancy in recently implemented landscape-scale logging projects designed as firebreaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Stephens1">Stephens et al. 2014</xref>), and Northern Spotted Owls avoided foraging in stands that were logged postfire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Clark1">Clark 2007</xref>). In addition, many avian species that colonize postfire forests were significantly less abundant in postfire-logged patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Saab1">Saab et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Hanson1">Hanson and North 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Hutto1">Hutto 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Cahall1">Cahall and Hayes 2009</xref>). Therefore, we urge managers to consider that the purpose and need for postfire logging, and for fuels treatments intended to reduce the risk of high-severity fire, conflicts with conservation of the Spotted Owl and other species.Assessments of Spotted Owl sites based on recent reproductive output can provide an efficient and accurate measure of the relative contribution of specific sites to population growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Sergio1">Sergio and Newton 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Peery1">Peery and Guti&eacute;rrez 2012</xref>), and can enable managers to prioritize conservation efforts at sites that support high levels of reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Sergio2">Sergio et al. 2009</xref>). In southern California, where both demographic and site-occupancy data strongly indicate a declining owl population, sites with successfully reproducing owls likely are making consistent, relatively large contributions to overall population growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-307-Runge1">Runge et al. 2006</xref>). Our results indicate that occupancy of these important sites that consistently supported reproductive owls exhibited negligible effects from high-severity fire. Protective measures should be in place for all known Spotted Owl sites, but sites with recent owl reproduction and sites with higher amounts of tree cover in the 203-ha core area should receive enhanced protection from management actions that modify vegetation utilized by Spotted Owls, including fuels treatments and postfire logging.We are indebted to R.
