Composition of the genus Hanleya (Mollusca: Polyplacophora: Lepidopleurida), with the description of two new speciesAn evaluation of all species of the genus Hanleya showed that they only inhabit the Atlantic Ocean, occurring from off Brazil (25°44′S) to the Barents Sea (74°27′N). The majority of records refer to H. nagelfar which ranges from 9°03′8′′N to 74°27′N in coastal waters of North America, Europe and Africa. There are six Recent species of Hanleya: H. tropicalis Dall, 1881, H. brachyplax Jardim and Simone, 2010b, H. harasewychi sp. nov, H. mediterranea sp. nov, H. hanleyi (Bean in Thorpe, 1844) and H. nagelfar (Lovén, 1846). The phylogenetic relationship of H. hanleyi and H. nagelfar has long been questioned. New data on age variability of Hanleya nagelfar are provided. Hanleya hanleyi is the only species of the genus that also occurs in the intertidal zone. All other members of Hanleya inhabit mainly bathyal or sublittoral depths: H. nagelfar (28–1680 m), H. tropicalis (230 m), H. brachyplax (250–408 m), H. harasewychi (73–115 m), H. mediterranea (50–200 m).http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:CB8027AC-6755-4F44-9A02-D5C539D84D1F
