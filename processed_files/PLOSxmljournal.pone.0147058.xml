The increasing number of quantitative assessments of homogenization using citizen science data is particularly important in the Neotropics, given its high biodiversity and ecological peculiarity, and whose communities may react differently to landscape changes. We looked for evidence of taxonomic homogenization in terrestrial birds by investigating patterns of beta diversity along a gradient of human-altered landscapes (HAL), trying to identify species associated with this process. We analyzed bird data from 87 sites sampled in a citizen science program in the south Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Regional-scale taxonomic homogenization was assessed by comparing beta diversity among sites in different HALs (natural, rural or urban landscapes) accounting for variation derived from geographical distance and zoogeographical affinities by georeferencing sites and determining their position in a phytogeographical domain. Beta diversity was calculated by multivariate dispersion and by testing compositional changes due to turnover and nestedness among HALs and phytogeographical domains. Finally, we assessed which species were typical for each group using indicator species analysis. Bird homogenization was indicated by decreases in beta diversity following landscape changes. Beta diversity of rural sites was roughly half that of natural habitats, while urban sites held less than 10% of the natural areasâ€™ beta diversity. Species composition analysis revealed that the turnover component was important in differentiating sites depending on HAL and phytogeography; the nestedness component was important among HALs, where directional species loss is maintained even considering effects of sampling effort. A similar result was obtained among phytogeographical domains, indicating nested-pattern dissimilarity among compositions of overlapping communities. As expected, a few native generalists and non-native urban specialists were characteristic of rural and urban sites. We generated strong evidence that taxonomic homogenization occurs in the south Brazilian Atlantic Forest as a result of a directional and nested species loss, with the resultant assemblages composed of few disturbance-tolerant birds.  Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was computed using the Raupâ€“Crick method. The axes represent 11,1% and 8,6% of data variation, respectively for PCoA 1 and 2. Each point represents the composition of the avifauna at a particular sampling site; point dispersal in this two dimensional space corresponds to total beta diversity within each category (demarcated by convex hulls). The influence of human-induced alterations of the landscape on the composition of the assemblage (above) appears to show a nested pattern, with rural and urban birds representing a subsample of the avifauna of the natural sites. Total beta diversity is clearly lower in urban sites (black triangles) compared to both rural (dark grey squares) and natural sampling sites (light grey dots). Bird species composition is also influenced by phytogeography (below), with the dense forest (light grey â€œxâ€) avifauna considerably different from that of both the mixed forest (black â€œ+â€) and the semideciduous forest (dark grey â€œoâ€); beta diversity (point dispersion in space) in the mixed forest is lowest among the three categories.  Average distance to centroid in each group of sites from human-altered landscape (HAL) and phytogeographical categories, as obtained from a multivariate homogeneity of dispersion analysis. This metric corresponds to the beta diversity value used to assess the degree of homogenization of Atlantic Forest terrestrial bird assemblages. Statistically significant differences in the mean values of the distance to the centroid are depicted by different letters inside each column.  On the other hand, the turnover component is not expected to be much affected by sampling effort, since effort should not be biologically relevant to sample species substitution in space (as spatial distribution preferences is not related to species commonness). Indeed, our results point that this is the case. Finally, mixed results in the general Jaccard index, when summing both components, is also a probable result, but still the interaction among our categorical factors was shown to be a better predictor of assemblage composition differences, regardless of sampling effort differences, a result similar to that found in our GLM.
