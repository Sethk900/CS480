Remote sensing of mountain snow using active microwave sensors: a reviewThis work provides an overview of various methods for estimating snow cover and properties in high mountains using remote sensing techniques involving microwaves. Satellite-based remote sensing with its characteristics such as synoptic view, repetitive coverage and uniformity over large areas has great potential for identifying the temporal snow cover. Many sensors have been used in the past with various algorithms and accuracies for this purpose. These methods have been improving with the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar sensors, working in different microwave frequencies, polarisation and acquisition modes. The limitations, advantages and drawbacks are illustrated while error sources and strategies on how to ease their impacts are also reviewed. An extensive list of references, with an emphasis on studies since 1990s, allows the reader to delve into specific topics.
