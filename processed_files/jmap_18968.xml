Soil respiration and net ecosystem production in an onion field in central Hokkaido, JapanIn order to evaluate the effect of cultivation and fertilization on the carbon balance in an onion field, soil respiration rate was measured by the closed chamber method during the growth season for 2 years. Measurements were performed under the following conditions: T1, fertilized onion-growing treatment; T2, fertilized bare field treatment; T3, unfertilized onion-growing treatment; and T4, unfertilized bare field treatment. Soil respiration rates and the cumulative soil respiration ranged from 11 to 307 mg C m(-2) h(-1) and from 188 to 496 g C m(-2) year(-1), respectively. These values were higher in the onion-growing treatments than in the bare field treatments. The Q(10) values ranged from 1.6 to 3.1 and were significantly higher in the onion-growing treatments than in the bare field treatments. This difference was mainly due to root respiration. Fertilization did not exert any significant effect on soil respiration. Net primary production (NPP) ranged from 152 to 217 g C m(-2) year(-1) for the onion-growing treatments, and was higher in the fertilized treatments. Estimated net ecosystem production (NEP) ranged from -222 to +27 g C m(-2) year(-1), which was higher in the fertilized onion-growing treatment owing to the higher NPP. The difference between NEP and the amount of carbon in harvested onion (about 80% of NPP) corresponded to the amount of carbon sequestration in soil. The values ranged from -222 to -145 g C m(-2) year(-1). These negative values indicate that carbon loss by organic matter decomposition in soil was not compensated by the amount of organic matter input into soil.
