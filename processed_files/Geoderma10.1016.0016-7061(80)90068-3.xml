Some difficulties in the interpretation of experi-  mental outflow curves for hydraulic conductivity determinations. Geoderma, 23 : 285--297.    Experiments were conducted to measure the hydraulic conductivity of undisturbed  soil cores (differing in texture) both by one-step and Gardner's outflow methods. The ap-  paratus designed for the study is described. Results with soil cores are compared to those  from an artificial porous material having a stable and uniform pore-size distribution. Re-  suits indicate that in some cases the outflow pattern differs considerably from that pre-  dicted by diffusion theory. The deviation was much more pronounced at higher water  contents and with an increase in the complexity of the system. The outflow method at 50  mbar suction for a sample containing the highest amount of clay gave a K value 35-fold  smaller than that by the one-step method. At a 200-mbar suction, this difference de-  creased to a 4.7-fold. Much of the difficulty is attributed to unequal soil moisture distri-  bution, pendular rings or fingering phenomena as a consequence of pressure imposition at  higher water contents and underestimation of outflows even after greater equilibration  times at low water contents.    INTRODUCTION    Gardner (1956) proposed a method whereby the outflow of water from a  sample, created by an abrupt change in pressure and recorded as a function  of time, was used to calculate the hydraulic conductivity. It was further re-  fined to account for the non-negligible plate impedance (Miller and Elrick,  1958; Rijtema, 1959; Kunze and Kirkham, 1962). The method in its original  form rests on at least four basic assumptions: (1) that Darcy's law is appli-  cable to unsaturated soft-water movement; (2) that the soil water content is a  linear function of the soil-water pressure increment; (3) that the hydraulic    IOn leave from CSSRI, Karnal, India and presently with the Department of Soil Sciences  and Water Management, H~. Agricultural University, Palambur, India.  2Present address: Station de Bioclimatologie, Domaine Duclos, 97170 Petit Bourg,  Guadeloupe (French West Indies).    286    conductivity is constant throughout the imposed water content range; and  (4) that the porous-plate impedance is essentially negligible. Subsequent ex-  amination of the method from theoretical and experimental considerations  showed that assumption (3) was not usually met (Jackson et al., 1963; Cassel  et al., 1968). Several investigators (Kunze and Kirkham, 1962; Elrick, 1963;  Bruce and Klute, 1963; Shyr-Yaung and Tsen-Tuo, 1963; Jackson et al.,  1963; Miklich and Richards, 1965) reported poor agreement between experi-  mental data and theory even after accounting for plate impedance. The gen-  eral form of the problem was further complicated by the data of Davidson et  al. (1966b) showing dependence of the soil water content-pressure relation  on the rate at which a given pressure becomes established.  Nevertheless, the method is used to measure the water-transmitting prop-  erties of softs used for agriculture. It has both experimental and theoretical  difficulties that remain unresolved. Hence, it was the objective of the present  study to examine experimentally the outflow data obtained from undisturbed  soil samples that differed in texture. The undisturbed samples from different  depths of a profile were taken with the purpose of obtaining hydraulic con-  ductivity (K) values throughout the water content range that could be used  to quantify the water fluxes below the root-zone. The results are discussed  with reference to an artificially prepared sample having a stable and uniform  pore-size distribution. Keeping in view the uncertainty that exists in most  diffusivity and conductivity determinations, the same samples have also been  subjected to a different form of Gardner's method referred to as a one-step  method (Doering, 1965) and K values from the two have been compared.  This latter procedure does not require the above-mentioned assumptions al-  though it is assumed that water content at a given time during the outflow  process is almost uniform throughout the sample and is uniquely related to  soil water pressure.  A simple apparatus for making accurate measurements of outflow is also  described.    MATERIALS AND METHODS    Pressure chamber and automatic recording of the outflow    The outflow experiments were made in a pressure chamber with a ceramic  porous plate of about 1.3 bar air entry pressure. The samples studied for  both the reference material and undisturbed soil cores were enclosed in brass  rings of 5.4 cm internal diameter and 3 cm height that fitted tightly in the  pressure chamber. This was connected to an accurate automatic recording  device which could record a minimum of 0.009 cm3 of outflow. The com-  plete set-up is sketched in Fig. 1.  Water coming out of the chamber pushes a mercury column and the light  from the lamp is allowed to pass to the phototransistor which then becomes  a conductor. The current produced is amplified by the transistor and oper-    287    G)           ~ PRESSURE  LINE  BURETTE                           R~ORDiNS         DEVICE  J  PH O T O TRANSISTOR '~       SYR INOE  .POROUS PLATE/        \  I       ~F  /  L         I  ........  pRESS.RE  ..........................  ....  ~.

The mercury column is then pulled back to its original position  and the light is intercepted again. A precision potentiometer of 360non-stop  course is fixed to the axis of the motor and permits a continuous recording  of its angular position. This is calibrated to give the outflow. In our case a  complete rotation of the motor which corresponds to a full-scale circuit of  the recording device was equivalent to 0.467 cm3 of water.    Reference material    The reference porous material -- a mixture of 90% sand (essentially quartz)  and 10% clay (essentially kaolinite) -- was prepared following a procedure of  Fies (1971) in order to obtain reproducible physical characteristics and par-  ticle arrangement. The sand had the following grain size distribution for  100 g:  200--500~m--80  100--200/Jm--12  &lt;lO0/~m--8  Sand and clay were first thoroughly mixed with an amount of water suf-  ficient to obtain an almost liquid paste. This paste was then placed into a  column constructed by joining together four brass rings (the same as des-  cribed above) resting on a porous plate. The filling was done very carefully in    288    order to avoid air entrapment. Afterward the upper end of the column was  capped to prevent evaporation and the excess water was allowed to drain  through the porous plate by applying the following suction sequence:  Suction       :3   10   20   72  (cm mercury)  Duration (h)  : 1    1   16    8  The top cap was then removed and the column was air-dried for about  two days by passing air through it.  The total clay migration during the drainage phase was less than 1% and  was restricted to the bottom 2 cm. The longitudinal shrinkage was 3%. The  resulting average characteristics are given below:  Particle density: 2.66 g cm-3  Bulk density   : 1.70 -+ 0.015 g cm-3  K saturated    : 2.42 cm h-1    Soil samples    The undisturbed soil cores (using the brass rings described above) were  taken at three depths (hereafter referred as A, B and C, respectively) in a  profile on the experimental farm "La Mini~re", Institut National de la Re-  cherche Agronomique. The soils are characterised as MoUic Ustalfs according  to Soil Taxonomy (1975). The mechanical composition of the soil samples is  given in Table I. All samples were stored in a cold room (4).

The pressure chambers were tightly reas-  sembled and both the reference and soft samples were vacuum-saturated.  After a minimum of two days of Vacuum saturation the pressure chambers  were weighed and connected to the recording system. For the one-step meth-  od the samples were first equilibrated to 10 mbar and then one large step of    289    1,000 mbar was imposed. Normally, the small-step increments followed the  one-step method for the same sample after a new cycle of vacuum-saturation.  About eleven intermediary pressure steps of unequal values were used to cov-  er the 0--1,000 mbar range. All measurements were made in a constant tem-  perature room (22o C).  At the end of the run, the soil bulk density, porosity and water content at  saturation (0s) of the reference and soil samples were calculated and are given  in Table II.

Experimental outflow vs time curves: (a) abnormally long time of equilibration;  (b) and (c) normal form of outflow curves; (d) apparently shorter time of equilibration.    292    times of equilibration than expected from the beginning of the outflow.  The first form of curve was obtained with the natural undisturbed soil  cores at high water contents, mainly for pressure values less than 180 mbar.  Beyond that the outflow curves shifted to the normal form. A typical exam-  ple of such curves for a pressure step of 10--30 mbar is presented in Fig. 2a  for soil sample C, which contained the highest quantity of clay. These broken  curves are interpreted mainly as a consequence of a great decrease in D value  during the outflow. In the case presented in Fig. 2a, two straight lines could  be drawn through the experimental points, i.e.: (1) through the first 60 min  of outflow; and (2) from 60 min to the end of the outflow. The first part of  this curve corresponds to 0.243 cm3 and to a D value of 6.54 cm2 h-1 . The  remaining part gives 0.331 cm3 and corresponds to a D value of about 0.27  cm~ h-1 . So, D is not constant within the imposed pressure increment and  invalidates assumption (3) at high moisture contents in water-wet media such  as soils. Similar results have been reported by several investigators (Gardner,  1956; Kunze and Kirkham, 1962; Elrick, 1963; Bruce and Klute, 1963;  Shyr-Yaung and Tsen-Tuo, 1963; Jackson et al., 1963; Miklich and Richards,  1965), all showing poor agreement between experimental data and the theo-  ry, particularly at high water contents. These results, with the exception of  those by Gardner (1956), included consideration of plate impedance in the  theory.  Such breaks in the outflow curves were much more pronounced with in-  creases in the clay content in the soil sample. The decrease in the hydraulic  diffusivity may not be the only explanation of this abnormally long tailing  of the outflow curves. When the clay content increases, the geometry of the  porous system becomes more complex and a sudden change in the air pres-  sure may not be instantaneously and evenly transmitted through the whole  system. Thus, water-filled pores which are of the size that should drain at a  given pressure will not do so unless there is a free passage to the atmosphere.  If the flow path from the pore in question to the atmosphere contains at  least one smaller pore, the entry of air to the pore is blocked because all  smaller pores will be filled with water. This could result in unequal soil-mois-  ture distribution (Davidson et al., 1966a), pendular rings (Morrow and Harris,  1965), or fingering phenomena (Elrick, 1963) which would explain the  greater equilibration times particularly at high water contents.  The second category of curves (normal ones) was obtained with the refer-  ence even at high water contents and with undisturbed soil samples at pres-  sure values higher than 180 mbar but less than 750 mbar (Fig. 2b and c).  The third type of curve (shortened tails) was encountered for the soil sam-  ples at pressure values higher than 750 mbar and for the reference above 40  mbar (Fig. 2d). As shown in Fig. 3, these values of pressure, which correspond  in both cases to relatively small water contents and low value of 38/3 t, were  associated with very low values of diffusivity. Hence, the equilibrium times  were very long, even exceeding one week. In our opinion, the discrepancy  found between experimental curves and theory is only apparent and could     '  .80~    "   40  .~0 i    293    10                                         REFERENCE  -D--  200                                 400                                   600                                  ~00                               I OOO  h - mbar s    Fig. 3.

This  generally results in some underestimation of the total volume of outflow  (incomplete equilibrium). As is apparent in Fig. 2d, an experimental curve of  our third type can be shifted to a normal one (dotted line) by assuming that  instead of being a true equilibrium value, the final outflow volume repre-  sented in this case only 83% of this equilibrium value. It follows that to get  90% of the water extracted from the sample, the outflow measurements  would have to be continued for an additional 500 rain.    Comparison between small-step and one-step outflow    Fig. 4 depicts hydraulic conductivity (K) expressed as a function of water  content (0) by the relationship of the type K = aeB~ for the reference and  soil samples (A, B, C) under both methods. As a rule the duplicate samples  agreed fairly well. For the reference and for soil sample C only one sample  could be run in the one~tep method. In all cases the one,step method pro-  duced comparatively higher values of K. The magnitude of differences, how-  ever, was smaller at low than at high water contents.

For example, at 50 mbar suction the outflow method gave K values about 3,  4, 7 and 35-fold smaller than those by the one-step method for the reference,  A, B and C samples, respectively. At the 200-mbar suction, however, this  difference decreased to 1.3, 1.2, 2.3 and 4.7-fold, respectively. Thus, much  of the difficulty with the outflow method occurs at high water contents  {suctions approximately smaller than 200 mbar) where the important water  conductivity takes place. The problem is further aggravated by increasing  complexity of the system where, as stated earlier, size of the pressure incre-  ment governs to a greater extent the number of pore sequences and water  content distribution within pore sequences. For instance, in sample C the  method fails to give any reliable values at suctions smaller than 100 mbar.  Although plate impedance will have its effect, particularly at high water  contents, it would be difficult under such conditions to identify its magni-  tude in order to make the required adjustments. Gardner (1962) also ex-  pressed the doubtful utility of an adjustment for membrane impedance. In  addition to the difficulties of interpretation, the method has inherent prob-  lems in use. It is not practical to use pressure increments small enough to val-  idate the assumption of constant D. For example, in Fig. 2a, it is difficult to  ascribe any constant value of D for the pressure increment of 10--30 mbar.  Similar results have been reported by Jackson et al. (1963) and Davidson et  al. (1966a).  In comparison, the one-step method is rapid and easier to use but in the  absence of a third source of comparison for the inconsistent results obtained,  particularly at higher water contents, it is difficult to suggest which, if either,  of the two methods ought to be used. However, the one-step method is pre-  ferred over the small-step because it is simpler and faster. At suctions greater  than 200 mbar, either of the two methods could be used because above this  suction range the methods give similar results.  Although, as stated above, the important water conductivity takes place in  the suction ranges below 200 mbar, yet, in water balance studies it is of im-  portance to estimate the fluxes either leaving or entering the root-zone where  the suction is often greater than 200 mbar. With the prior knowledge of K vs  0 relationships for different profile depths and by evaluation of hydraulic  gradients in situ during the crop growth, the flux divergence at different  depths could be calculated. On the experimental farm La Mini~re from which  the soil samples were taken, crops are rain-fed and normally no irrigation is  required. Consequently, it is important to maintain a record of water in the  soil that could be available for plant growth. The total amount available  would depend in part on the possibility of movement of water into the root-  ing zone. Similar situations could also obtain elsewhere in soils on which  crop growth depends on rainfall.    297    REFERENCES    Bruce, R.R. and Klute, A., 1963.

AbstractExperiments were conducted to measure the hydraulic conductivity of undisturbed soil cores (differing in texture) both by one-step and Gardner's outflow methods. The apparatus designed for the study is described. Results with soil cores are compared to those from an artificial porous material having a stable and uniform pore-size distribution. Results indicate that in some cases the outflow pattern differs considerably from that predicted by diffusion theory. The deviation was much more pronounced at higher water contents and with an increase in the complexity of the system. The outflow method at 50 mbar suction for a sample containing the highest amount of clay gave a K value 35-fold smaller than that by the one-step method. At a 200-mbar suction, this difference decreased to a 4.7-fold. Much of the difficulty is attributed to unequal soil moisture distribution, pendular rings or fingering phenomena as a consequence of pressure imposition at higher water contents and underestimation of outflows even after greater equilibration times at low water contents.
