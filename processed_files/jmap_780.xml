Temporal and spatial variation in soil respiration of poplar plantations at different developmental stages in Xinjiang, China.Soil respiration is essential for the understanding of carbon sequestration of forest plantations. Soil respiration of poplar plantations at three developmental stages was investigated in 2007 and 2008. The results showed that mean soil respiration rate was 5.74, 5.10 and 4.71 â•¬â•mol CO2 m-2 s-1 for stands of 2-, 7- and 12-year-old, respectively, during the growing season. Soil temperature decreased with increasing plantation age and canopy cover. As plantation matured, fine root biomass also declined. Multiple regression analysis suggested that soil temperature in the upper layer could explain 73-77% of the variation in soil respiration and fine root biomass in the upper layer could explain further 5-8%. The seasonal dynamics of soil respiration was mainly controlled by soil temperature rhythm and fine root growth since soil water availability remained adequate due to monthly irrigation. Spatial variability of soil respiration varied considerably among three age classes, with the coefficient of variation of 28.8%, 22.4% and 19.6% for stands of 2-, 7- and 12-year-old, respectively. The results highlight the importance of the development stage in soil carbon budget over a rotation, since both temporal and spatial variation in soil respiration displayed significant differences at different developmental stages.
