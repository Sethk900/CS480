Parasitic plants obtain nutrients, carbohydrates, ions and water from their host plants and develop special morphological features to survive on the living tissue of other plants. We investigated the mistletoe  Psilocephalus acaciae  on halophytic and non-halophytic hosts in the Arava Valley. When  P. acaciae  was parasitic on halophytic hosts, ions were transported by the transpiration stream in the parasite. Chloride and sodium induced the development of leaf succulence in the parasite. Increasing succulence is a morphological adaptation by the mistletoe to the increasing salt stress on halophytic hosts.  Halophytes develop various morphological and physiological traits that enable them to grow successfully on saline substrates. Parasitic plants on halophytic hosts may also encounter salt stress. We investigated the mistletoe  Plicosepalus acaciae  (syn:  Loranthus acacia ; Loranthaceae), which occurs on 5 halophytic and at least 10 non-halophytic hosts in the Southern Arava Valley (Israel).  Plicosepalus acaciae  is a common parasite north of Eilat to the Dead Sea area and in the Jordan Valley. Morphological and physiological responses of  P. acaciae  to salinity were investigated by comparison of plants on halophytic with those on non-halophytic hosts. Ion patterns of different host–parasite associations were determined as was the development of leaf succulence at different growth stages. The leaf water content of  P. acaciae  increased and leaves developed succulence when growing on halophytic hosts, especially on  Tamarix  species, where leaf water content was three times higher than that on non-halophytic hosts and the leaf volume increased four to five times. The reason for increased succulence was a higher ion concentration of, and osmotic adjustment with, Na +  and Cl − .  Plicosepalus acaciae  showed a high morphological and ecophysiological plasticity, enabling it to cope with salt stress, and can be classified as a facultative eu-halophyte, which increases its halo-succulence according to the host. Host–parasite associations are a model system for the investigation of halophytes under different salt stress conditions.  Halophytes develop various physiological and morphological adaptations to cope with high salt concentrations in soil and water ( Waisel 1972 ;  Breckle 2002 ;  Flowers and Colmer 2008 ), and the regulation of uptake of Na + , K +  and Cl −  and transportation and storage of these ions in plant organs are key issues to understand life strategies ( Breckle 1990 ). In combination with the physiological processes, morphological adaptations like leaf bladders, salt glands and succulence develop to mitigate the effects of high salt concentrations in the photosynthesizing tissue by desalinization of leaves or dilution or compartmentalization within leaf tissues ( Breckle 1974 ,  2002 ;  Schirmer and Breckle 1982 ;  Freitas and Breckle 1992 ;  Veste 2007 a  ). Furthermore, the ion pattern and chemical composition of terrestrial halophytes are often characteristic of the species and family and only partly influenced by soil conditions (‘physiotype concept’;  Albert 1982 ). For example, some desert halophytic members of the Aizoaceae are characterized by a selective hyper-accumulation of Na +  and Cl −  in their leaves even on soils with low salinity ( Veste  et al . 2004 ;  Veste 2007 a  ) as is also the case with the members of Amaranthaceae (Chenopodiaceae: see  Veste and Breckle 2000 ;  Albert 2005 ). On the other hand, members of the Poaceae are able to limit the uptake of Na +  ( Albert 1982 ,  2005 ). This emphasizes the importance of active ion regulation and selective transportation of ions already in the root system.  An interesting question is what happens if the root system for such ion selection is missing, as in the case with parasitic plants? Is the pattern of ion accumulation between host and parasite mirrored to some extent? In this context, xylem-tapping mistletoes are a perfect model lacking a root system for selective ion uptake. Water and nutrient uptake is directly linked to their hosts ( Glatzel and Geils 2009 ) through a haustorium, which connects the parasite with its host and allows the transportation of water, inorganic and organic compounds from the host’s transpiration stream directly into the parasite. While there has been considerable attention to nutrient exchange between the parasite and the host (e.g.  Lamont 1983 ;  Glatzel and Balasubramaniam 1987 ;  Popp 1987 ), only little attention has been given to mistletoes growing on halophytic hosts and the influence of the salinity experienced by the host on the parasite. There are several reports from mistletoes on mangroves:  Phthirusa maritima  (Loranthaceae) on  Conocarpus erectus  and  Coccoloba uvifera  ( Goldstein  et al.  1989 );  Lysiana subfalcata  on  Ceriops tagal  ( Ullmann  et al.  1985 ),  Loranthus rhamnifolius  on  Sonneratia alba  and  Loranthus sansibarensis  and  L. dregei  on  Lumnitzera racemosa  ( Walter and Steiner 1936 ) and  Loranthus capitellatus  ( Holtermann 1907 ). In these cases, the mistletoes on mangroves have a 0.2- to 3.5-fold higher Na +  concentration than their hosts ( Lamont 1983 ;  Goldstein  et al.  1989 ). In South Africa and Namibia, of 19 mistletoes only  Tapinanthus oleifolius  (Loranthaceae) occurs on the halophytes  Tamarix usneoides  and  Salvadora persica  ( Visser 1981 ;  Popp  et al.  1995 ), where it has a higher salt concentration in its xylem sap than the host.  Tapinanthus oleifolius  also increases its leaf succulence on the halophytic  T. usneoides  as well as on non-halophytic  Euphorbia virosa  ( Veste 2007 b  ), which is strongly correlated with the accumulation of inorganic ions ( Popp  et al.  1995 ).  Tamarix ramosissima  is an uncommon host for  Phoradendron californicum  (Loranthaceae) in North America, but the mistletoe is able to grow on the halophyte ( Haigh 1996 ).  Another example for such a host–mistletoe association is  Plicosepalus acaciae  (syn:  Loranthus acaciae ; Loranthaceae) with an east-Sudanian distribution. The mistletoe occurs along the Arava Valley and some adjacent wadi systems north to the Jordan Valley and in some parts of Jordan ( Shmida and Darom 1992 ;  Qasem 2009 ,  2011 ). Within the Arava Valley, the highest density of  P. acaciae  can be found close to Yotvata ( Todt  et al.  2000 ), where most of the trees are parasitized by  P. acaciae . The number of parasites decreases strongly a few kilometres north and south of Yotvata, and the movement pattern of the bird bulbul ( Pycnonotus xanthopygos ), as the main disperser of the red berries with sticky seeds, can explain the distribution of  P. acaciae  in the Arava Valley ( Green  et al.  2009 ). The most common hosts are Acacia trees because of their wide distribution ( Munzbergova and Ward 2002 ;  Bowie and Ward 2004 ). Other hosts for  P. acaciae  in the southern Arava Valley are trees and shrubs ( Atriplex ,  Nitraria  and  Tamarix ;  Todt  et al.  2000 ). On these hosts the parasite shows morphological and physiological plasticity as known for other halophytes ( Breckle 2002 ) growing under different salt conditions. This high flexibility makes the different host–parasite associations of  P. acaciae  an interesting model system to understand adaptive plasticity to salt stress. We wanted to check how the parasite is able to cope with halophytic hosts growing under high salinity stress and the ecophysiological plasticity of ion accumulation that is involved. A special focus is given to ion uptake and its link with the development of leaf succulence at different growth stages on different hosts. We also compiled an updated checklist of the known host–parasite associations.  Climatic diagram of Yotvata (southern Arava, Israel) indicating the 12-months arid season.  Ion content was determined in hot water extracts with an atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS 2280, Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) with a C 2 H 2  flame. Cl was determined with a micro-chlorocounter (Marius, Utrecht, NL). In all analytic determinations, there were three repetitions. If the relative standard deviation was &gt;2 %, then additional checks were made.  Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS package 7.5.1. We checked the normality of distributions and variance of all samples with the Kolgomorov–Smirnow test ( Köhler  et al.  1996 ;  Lozán and Kausch 1998 ). For correlation analysis we used Spearman's rank correlation coefficient ( r ’s). Significance of differences between samples fixed at the 0.05 probability level for all statistical tests was checked with the Mann–Whitney  U  test.

Previously published information on hosts of  P. acaciae  ( Zohary 1966 ;  Feinbrun-Dothan  et al.  1991 ;  Shmida and Darom 1992 ) mentioned  Atriplex  and  Tamarix  but no particular species.  Qasem (2009 ,  2011 ) updated the list of hosts of  P. acaciae  in Jordan to 26 species from 12 families (included in Table  1 ). In total, there are now 37 non- and 6 halophytic hosts known. Similar to other halophytes, the succulence observed for  P. acaciae  growing on halophytic hosts showed a morphological adaptation of the mistletoe to salt stress ( Breckle 1990 ). The increased succulence presumably resulted from absorption of Na +  and Cl −  ions from the host and osmotic adjustment by the parasite ( Veste and Breckle 1995 ). There was a highly significant correlation between the succulence and Na +  and Cl −  accumulation, which is in accordance with observations made by  Popp  et al.  (1995)  for  T. oleifolius  growing on  Tamarix usnoides  in Namibia. An increase of Na +  can also be deduced from the higher Na/K ratio on halophytic than non-halophytic hosts (see Table  2 ), a very general rule for many other non-parasitic halophytes ( Albert 1982 ;  Reimann and Breckle 1993 ;  Breckle 2002 ).  Popp and Richter (1998)  also reported an increase in Na/K ratios for  T. oleifolius  growing on  T. usneoides  from 1.58 to 13.21 with increasing leaf age.  The concentrations of osmotically active ions were not strongly correlated with those of the parasite. This may easily be explained by the fact that the samples of leaves from the parasite and of the corresponding young host stems or host leaves were not directly osmotically dependent. Similarly, the Na/K ratios did not reflect the relation between the host and the parasite (Tables  2  and  4 ).  It is difficult to be certain about the concentrations of ions available to the haustoria of the parasite, as obtaining xylem sap (the presumed source) is in itself difficult. However, the concentrations of monovalent ions in the leaves of the host are unlikely to provide a good indication of the xylem concentrations due to the presence of salt bladders ( Atriplex  species) or salt glands ( Tamarix  species). Additionally osmotic adjustment may involve compatible solutes ( Yancey 1994 ;  Flowers and Colmer 2008 ), which we did not investigate; they are, however, found in other mistletoes ( Popp and Polania 1989 ), although in the more succulent leaves of  T. oleifolius  they are of minor importance for osmotic adjustment ( Popp  et al.  1995 ).  Various definitions and classifications of halophytes have been proposed over the past decades, but following the classification of halophytes by Breckle ( 1990 ,  2000 ,  2002 ), which includes the mechanisms for controlling the NaCl concentration in plants,  P. acaciae  is a facultative eu-halophyte.  Plicosepalus acaciae  increases its halo-succulence according to the host, which is in this respect comparable with soil substrates. In any case, the water and nutrient status of the host plants, especially under desert conditions has a strong influence on the equilibrium of host and parasite and thus may mutually influence mortality ( Bowie and Ward 2004 ). Surface structure, size and indirectly host origin influence the success of germination and of seedling establishment of parasite on host twigs ( Rödl and Ward 2002 ): whether, during these early stages of development, the halophytic character of the host plant and salinity plays a role is still unclear. Host specificity seems to be rather low in mistletoes ( Norton and Carpenter 1998 ;  Norton and de Lange 1999 ) since seeds germinate readily in almost all situations, whereas other parasitic plants germinate only in response to chemical signals from the host plants. In future a more detailed analysis of xylem concentrations and ion patterns of host and parasite is a strong necessity for a better understanding of ecophysiological behaviour and the differing infestation rates of the parasite on different species of the host. But our results show that the ion pattern of substrate (host) and plant (parasite) is, to some extent, mirrored, but that haustoria of the parasite (similar to roots in soil) have only a limited capacity for ion selectivity. Thus, we can conclude that the mistletoe we studied exhibited an adaptive plasticity depending on substrate conditions offered by the host, reflecting the xylem sap concentrations of Na +  and Cl − . Basically this host–parasite association is an excellent model system and could be used for future ecophysiological research on halophytes.
