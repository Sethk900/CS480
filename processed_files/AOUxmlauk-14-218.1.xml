However, where defenses are costly, hosts can benefit by facultative expression of defenses in relation to the risk of parasitism. The results of our model-presentation experiments show that Superb Fairy-wrens (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Malurus cyaneus</named-content></italic>) mediate vigilance around their nest according to their perceived risk of brood parasitism; when the risk of parasitism is high, they increase the time they spend in the vicinity of their nests. In combination with previous studies, these data suggest that Superb Fairy-wrens have a plastic defense portfolio that can be acquired rapidly and deployed facultatively to prevent parasitism while minimizing wasteful investment in defenses in the absence of parasitism.Los par&aacute;sitos de nidada t&iacute;picamente imponen costos a sus hospederos, lo cual selecciona la aparici&oacute;n de defensas por parte del hospedador.

Such plasticity in defenses is likely to evolve when host defenses carry costs (e.g., mistaken rejection of their own young or increased visibility to predators) or when the probability of parasitism varies over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Tewksbury1">Tewksbury et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Caro1">Caro 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Welbergen2">Welbergen and Davies 2012</xref>).Superb Fairy-wrens (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Malurus cyaneus</named-content></italic>) provide a good model for studying defense portfolios against brood parasitism. They are the primary host of Horsfield's Bronze-cuckoo (<italic>Chalcites basalis</italic>) in southeastern Australia and recognize cuckoos as a specific type of threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Feeney2">Feeney et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Kleindorfer1">Kleindorfer et al. 2013</xref>). They defend against brood parasitism through aggressive group mobbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Feeney2">Feeney et al. 2013</xref>) and by abandoning cuckoo chicks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Langmore3">Langmore et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Langmore1">2009</xref>). During mobbing, larger breeding groups of Superb Fairy-wrens attack cuckoos more vigorously and are parasitized less than smaller groups, despite there being benefits to cuckoos that successfully parasitize larger groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Feeney2">Feeney et al. 2013</xref>). Unlike many other hosts of brood parasites, they very rarely reject cuckoo eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Langmore5">Langmore et al. 2005</xref>). Parasitism rates by Horsfield's Bronze-cuckoo vary dramatically between years, with 0&ndash;37&percnt; of nests in which eggs were laid being parasitized in each breeding season (parasitism occurred in 8&ndash;15 yr between 1999 and 2013 at Campbell Park, Canberra, Australia; <italic>n</italic> &equals; 1,297 nests). Suppression of defenses during years when cuckoos are absent could therefore reduce the risk of costly recognition errors, such as misdirected mobbing or mistaken rejection of a Superb Fairy-wren chick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Langmore1">Langmore et al. 2009</xref>). Accordingly, Superb Fairy-wrens suppressed chick rejection behavior in years when cuckoos were absent from the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Langmore1">Langmore et al. 2009</xref>).The degree to which Superb Fairy-wren &ldquo;frontline&rdquo; defenses (defenses that are deployed prior to parasitism of the nest; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Feeney4">Feeney et al. 2012</xref>) are mediated according to the perceived risk of brood parasitism is not well understood. Recognition and mobbing of adult cuckoos are learned traits in Superb Fairy-wrens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Langmore2">Langmore et al. 2012</xref>) that can be acquired through social transmission of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Feeney1">Feeney and Langmore 2013</xref>). Once learned, an aggressive response toward a cuckoo can be elicited for several years, even without cuckoos being present in the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Langmore2">Langmore et al. 2012</xref>). Superb Fairy-wrens mediate their vigilance around their nest according to their perceived risk of nest predation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Yasukawa1">Yasukawa and Cockburn 2009</xref>), and Eurasisan Reed Warblers (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Acrocephalus scirpaceus</named-content></italic>), a host of the Common Cuckoo (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Cuculus canorus</named-content></italic>), become more vigilant around their nest after seeing a cuckoo mount (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Davies2">Davies et al. 2003</xref>). Here, we investigate whether Superb Fairy-wrens adjust their nest vigilance according to their perceived risk of brood parasitism.Fieldwork took place in Campbell Park, a eucalypt woodland nature reserve in Canberra, Australia (149&deg;10&prime;E, 35&deg;12&prime;S), between October and December, 2012 and 2013. Superb Fairy-wrens are small (10 g), resident, facultatively cooperative-breeding passerines that are endemic to southeastern Australia and common at this study site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Rowley1">Rowley and Russell 1997</xref>). They build a dome-shaped, grass nest in low vegetation. Throughout their range, they are the primary host of Horsfield's Bronze-cuckoos and a secondary host of Shining Bronze-cuckoos (<italic>C. lucidus</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Brooker1">Brooker and Brooker 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Langmore6">Langmore et al. 2008</xref>). Both cuckoo species are migratory and generally arrive at the study site between August and November.We used model-presentation experiments to test whether Superb Fairy-wrens changed the amount of time they spent close to their nest according to their perceived risk of brood parasitism. We used 2 freeze-dried Shining Bronze-cuckoos to simulate a threat of parasitism near the nest, and 2 freeze-dried White-plumed Honeyeaters (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Lichenostomus penicillatus</named-content></italic>) as controls. All specimens for freeze-drying were obtained from the freezer stock at the Australian Wildlife Collection, Canberra. Although Horsfield's Bronze-cuckoos (<italic>Chalcites basalis</italic>) are the more common brood parasite of Superb Fairy-wrens, we had no models available for use. However, Shining Bronze-cuckoos are morphologically similar to Horsfield's Bronze-cuckoos, and previous study of the closely related Splendid Fairy-wren (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">M. splendens</named-content></italic>) found that these hosts attacked Horsfield's Bronze-cuckoos and Shining Bronze-cuckoos in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Payne1">Payne et al. 1985</xref>). Both of these cuckoo species have been observed being mobbed by Superb Fairy-wrens in Campbell Park (W. E. Feeney and N. E. Langmore personal observation), and previous work using Shining Bronze-cuckoo models found that they elicit a highly aggressive response from Superb Fairy-wrens (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Langmore2">Langmore et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Feeney1">Feeney and Langmore 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Feeney2">Feeney et al. 2013</xref>), which suggests that they are an adequate substitute for Horsfield's Bronze-cuckoos. White-plumed Honeyeaters are common in Campbell Park, are similar in size (19 g) to Shining Bronze-cuckoos (23 g), and present no threat to Superb Fairy-wrens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Langmore2">Langmore et al. 2012</xref>). Accordingly, Superb Fairy-wrens exhibit lower levels of aggression to honeyeater models than to cuckoo models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Feeney2">Feeney et al. 2013</xref>).We conducted model presentations and nest watches at 30 Superb Fairy-wren nests (15 treatments and 15 controls). When a cuckoo is seen near the nest, Superb Fairy-wrens produce a cuckoo-specific vocalization that functions to &ldquo;rally&rdquo; other birds to quickly assist with mobbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Feeney2">Feeney et al. 2013</xref>), which suggests that increased vigilance around the nest by at least 1 individual may increase the likelihood of detecting, and deterring, a cuckoo. To ensure that the Superb Fairy-wrens used in our study recognized cuckoos as a threat, we conducted experiments only on groups that contained at least 1 color-banded bird that had previously shared habitat with breeding cuckoos. Birds were not banded specifically for the present study, but as part of a long-term project investigating coevolution between Superb Fairy-wrens and Horsfield's Bronze-cuckoos (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Langmore4">Langmore and Kilner 2007</xref>). Adult Superb Fairy-wrens were captured in mist nets, and nestlings were removed from the nest for banding, on days 6&ndash;7 of the nestling period.Approximately half an hour before the experiment commenced, a small camouflaged hide (Advantage Timber Standard Dome Hide C30) was set up 10&ndash;25 m from the nest of the focal group to allow for habituation. Following this, a 1-hr nest watch was conducted from the hide to establish the time spent by Superb Fairy-wren groups around their nest for comparisons with 2 equivalent (1-hr) nest watches immediately after the model presentation and the following day. The start time of the first and final nest watches were always matched. Each group was presented with either a cuckoo (experimental) or honeyeater (control) model for 5 min. Models were placed within a protective wire cage on a small experimental perch and placed &sim;2 m from the target Superb Fairy-wren nest (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Langmore2">Langmore et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Feeney1">Feeney and Langmore 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Feeney2">Feeney et al. 2013</xref>). To minimize disturbance to the nest, all movement near the nest by the experimenter was restricted to times when no birds were in sight. Our previous model-presentation experiments have never caused nest abandonment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Langmore3">Langmore et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Feeney1">Feeney and Langmore 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Feeney2">Feeney et al. 2013</xref>), and we likewise did not observe any nest abandonment as a result of the present experiments. All experiments were conducted during the final stages of nest building (while the nest was being lined), the period during which cuckoos monitor host nests and are mobbed aggressively by Superb Fairy-wrens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Feeney1">Feeney and Langmore 2013</xref>). All experiments were also conducted before Horsfield's Bronze-cuckoos arrived in the area.The time spent by the closest Superb Fairy-wren in the vicinity of the nest (&lt;10 m vs. &gt;10 m) was recorded in a notepad by the observer in the hide as a measure of vigilance around the nest. The open eucalypt woodlands in which these experiments were conducted are generally sparse, so locating Superb Fairy-wrens within 10 m of the nest is not difficult. We predicted that the nest vigilance of Superb Fairy-wrens would increase after seeing a cuckoo near their nest, but not after seeing a honeyeater.We used a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) to test whether nest vigilance changed after seeing a cuckoo or honeyeater near the nest. Our full model included treatment (cuckoo or honeyeater), model replicate, trial (pre-, post-, or the day following a presentation), date, group size, and all two-way interactions as fixed effects, and a group identifier as a random effect. Model replicate, date, group size, and their interactions were removed from the final model because they were nonsignificant. We used paired <italic>t</italic>-tests with Holm-Bonferroni <italic>P-</italic>value adjustments to identify differences between the treatments and trials.Nest vigilance of Superb Fairy-wrens differed significantly between cuckoo and honeyeater trials (GLMM: treatment &times; trial <inline-formula id="i0004-8038-132-2-359-ilm01"><inline-graphic xlink:href="i0004-8038-132-2-359-ilm01.gif" mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple"></inline-graphic></inline-formula> &equals; 22.16, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-f01">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-t01">Table 1</xref>).

By contrast, vigilance around the nest increased dramatically in the experimental groups following presentation of a cuckoo model, and this increase persisted until the following day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-f01">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-t02">Table 2</xref>).Time spent within 10 m of the nest by at least 1 Superb Fairy-wren prior to, immediately following, and the day after presentation of a cuckoo or honeyeater model (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 15 cuckoo and <italic>n</italic> &equals; 15 honeyeater presentations) in Campbell Park nature reserve, Canberra, Australia (October&ndash;December, 2012 and 2013).

By contrast, there was no significant change in the amount of time spent near their nest following presentation of a honeyeater model. These data suggest that Superb Fairy-wrens adjust their vigilance around the nest according to the perceived risk of brood parasitism.Together with the findings of previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Langmore3">Langmore et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Langmore1">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Langmore2">2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Langmore4">Langmore and Kilner 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Feeney1">Feeney and Langmore 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Feeney2">Feeney et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Kleindorfer1">Kleindorfer et al. 2013</xref>), these data suggest that Superb Fairy-wrens have a &ldquo;defense portfolio&rdquo; of adaptations centered on learning to recognize and respond to adult brood parasites, and that the strength of response varies according to their perceived risk of parasitism.

Recognition is specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Feeney2">Feeney et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Kleindorfer1">Kleindorfer et al. 2013</xref>), and sight of an adult cuckoo elicits a cuckoo-specific alarm call that functions to attract other birds to assist with aggressive group mobbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Feeney2">Feeney et al. 2013</xref>). The findings of the present study suggest that they also mediate their vigilance around their nest to maximize the likelihood of detecting and defending against cuckoldry after seeing a cuckoo near their nest (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Kleindorfer1">Kleindorfer et al. 2013</xref>). In addition to vigilance and mobbing, Superb Fairy-wrens also defend against brood parasitism by rejection of cuckoo chicks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Langmore3">Langmore et al. 2003</xref>). Chick rejection is also a phenotypically plastic defense that occurs only when adult cuckoos are present in the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Langmore1">Langmore et al. 2009</xref>). Thus, the principal defenses against cuckoos in this species appear to be exhibited only once the identity of a cuckoo has been learned, and defense by an individual appears to be strongly mediated according to the perceived risk of brood parasitism.Why some adaptations against brood parasitism persist despite generations of allopatry with brood parasites, while others are mediated according to the risk of brood parasitism, is likely to be related to the relative costs and benefits of maintenance of the trait and phenotypic plasticity in trait expression. Plasticity through learning is likely to be particularly beneficial in recognition of adult brood parasites because it facilitates a rapid response to a novel brood parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Feeney1">Feeney and Langmore 2013</xref>) or brood parasite morph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Honza1">Honza et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Thorogood1">Thorogood and Davies 2012</xref>), and defenses will be expressed specifically in response to the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Gill1">Gill and Sealy 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Feeney2">Feeney et al. 2013</xref>). Correspondingly, in European Reed Warblers, frontline adaptations such as nest vigilance and mobbing were mediated according to the perceived risk of brood parasitism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Davies2">Davies et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Welbergen1">Welbergen and Davies 2009</xref>) and were expressed only in response to the local cuckoo morph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Thorogood1">Thorogood and Davies 2012</xref>). Similarly, Common Chaffinches (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Fringilla coelebs</named-content></italic>) that were released from parasitism after being introduced to New Zealand &le;130 yr ago did not exhibit aggressive behavior toward adult brood parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Hale1">Hale and Briskie 2007</xref>), and host populations that were sympatric with brood parasites responded more aggressively to a model brood parasite than allopatric populations in Yellow Warblers (<italic>Setophaga petechia</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Briskie1">Briskie et al. 1992</xref>), American Redstarts (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. ruticilla</named-content></italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Hobson1">Hobson and Villard 1998</xref>), Superb Fairy-wrens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Langmore2">Langmore et al. 2012</xref>), and a variety of hosts of the Common Cuckoo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Lindholm1">Lindholm and Thomas 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Roskaft1">R&oslash;skaft et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Honza1">Honza et al. 2006</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Tewksbury1">Tewksbury et al. (2002)</xref> found that an increase in nest vigilance according to the perceived risk of brood parasitism in Yellow Warblers was coupled with an increase in nest depredation rates, highlighting a cost&ndash;benefit trade-off of an antiparasite behavior that can be mediated by phenotypic plasticity.By contrast, learning through exposure to brood parasites may not be required for effective egg rejection based on discordancy (rejection of the odd egg out; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Rothstein1">Rothstein 1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Marchetti1">Marchetti 2000</xref>) or template-based egg discrimination (recognition of own eggs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Rothstein1">Rothstein 1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Lotem1">Lotem et al. 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Lahti2">Lahti and Lahti 2002</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Hauber1">Hauber et al. 2006</xref>). Thus, plasticity in egg rejection behavior is likely to be adaptive only when maintenance of the trait in the absence of parasitism is costly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Rothstein2">Rothstein 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Peer2">Peer et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Soler1">Soler 2014</xref>). Several studies support this prediction; recognition errors are common in European Reed Warblers (&gt;30&percnt; if the nest is parasitized with a mimetic model egg; Davies and Brooke 1988) and egg rejection is phenotypically plastic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Brooke1">Brooke et al. 1998</xref>), whereas in species in which recognition errors are less common, such as weavers (15&percnt;; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Lahti1">Lahti 2006</xref>) and several hosts of Brown-headed Cowbirds (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Molothrus ater</named-content></italic>) and Common Cuckoos (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Rothstein2">Rothstein 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Hale1">Hale and Briskie 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Peer2">Peer et al. 2007</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-2-359-Samas1">Samas et al. 2014</xref>), egg rejection is retained despite a century or more of separation from brood parasites.Superb Fairy-wrens appear to exhibit a flexible suite of defensive adaptations that can be acquired rapidly to combat variable parasitism regimes by Horsfield's Bronze-cuckoos. Further investigation of holistic adaptive portfolios in other systems will allow a more general understanding of the processes that determine the evolution and fate of adaptations that arise from exploiter&ndash;victim interactions.We are grateful to L.
