HEMIPARASITES GENERATE ENVIRONMENTAL HETEROGENEITY AND ENHANCE SPECIES COEXISTENCE IN SALT MARSHES.Tidal inundation and salinity are considered to be controlling factors in salt marsh species distributions. Parasitic plants may also influence community organization as parasite–host interactions may play a functional role in stress amelioration due to physiological mechanisms for salinity tolerance and resource acquisition. Endangered root hemiparasites (<em>Cordylanthus maritimus</em> ssp. <em>palustris</em> and <em>Cordylanthus mollis</em> ssp. <em>mollis</em>) occupy unique habitat within fragmented northern California tidal wetlands. My objective was to examine the effects of these root hemiparasites on soil salinity, aeration, and community composition. I compared experimentally established bare patches, shaded and unshaded, and parasite removal patches to controls with hemiparasites across intertidal elevation gradients. Plant community composition, soil salinity, and redox potential were measured as response variables. In this field removal experiment, I demonstrated that parasite–host associations can enhance the amelioration of physical stress conditions in the salt marsh exceeding the passive role of shading by vegetation. Consumer-driven reduction of physical stress resulted in increased plant species richness, and the effect was most pronounced with elevated salinity and hypoxia stress. Although previous studies have demonstrated that removal of dominant plant biomass by herbivores can increase physical stress in salt marshes, this is one of the first examples of a positive indirect effect of a consumer on community diversity through physical stress relief. Greater understanding of biological interactions coupled with abiotic factors may improve rare plant conservation and salt marsh restoration success.
