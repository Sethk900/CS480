Origin of gibbsite in a weathering profile from granite in west-central SpainGibbsite appears as the main secondary mineral in a weathering profile from granite situated in west-central Spain. Distribution of the mineral throughout the profile suggests that it is the result of alteration under past climates not very different from that of today. The presence of halloysite and amorphous materials indicates that these products are probably the intermediate stages in the transformation of the primary minerals, such as plagioclase, to gibbsite. Kaolinite is only found in the modern soil overlying the deep weathered material and therefore is not a product of ancient weathering.
