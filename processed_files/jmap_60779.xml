The impact of misregistration on SRTM and DEM image differencesImage differences between Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data and other Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are often performed for either accuracy assessment or for estimating vegetation height across the landscape. It has been widely assumed that the effect of sub-pixel misregistration between the two models on resultant image differences is negligible, yet this has not previously been tested in detail. The aim of this study was to determine the impact that various levels of misregistration have on image differences between SRTM and DEMs. First, very accurate image co-registration was performed at two study sites between higher resolution DEMs and SRTM data, and then image differences (SRTMâDEM) were performed after various levels of misregistration were systematically introduced into the SRTM data. It was found that: (1) misregistration caused an erroneous and dominant correlation between elevation difference and aspect across the landscape; (2) the direction of the misregistration defined the direction of this erroneous and systematic elevation difference; (3) for sub-pixel misregistration the error due solely to misregistration was greater than, or equal to the true difference between the two models for substantial proportions of the landscape (e.g., greater than 33% of the area for a half-pixel misregistration); and (4) the strength of the erroneous relationship with aspect was enhanced by steeper terrain. Spatial comparisons of DEMs were found to be sensitive to even sub-pixel misregistration between the two models, which resulted in a strong erroneous correlation with aspect. This misregistration induced correlation with aspect is not likely specific to SRTM data only; we expect it to be a generic relationship present in any DEM image difference analysis.
