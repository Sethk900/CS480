SCAR markers that specifically tag chromosomes 2D of wheat and 2J1 d of Thinopyrum distichumA SCAR marker for Thinopyrum distichum chromosome 2J1 d (involved in salt tolerance) also amplified a slightly larger fragment in chromosome 2D of common wheat and substituted hexaploid triticale. The Thinopyrum and wheat derived fragments were isolated and used to develop two new and highly specific markers for 2J1 dL and 2DL, respectively. The chromosome 2J1 dL marker is useful in attempts to introgress salt tolerance into cultivated wheat and triticale whereas the 2DL marker can be used for rapid identification of hexaploid triticales with the 2D(2R) chromosome substitution.
