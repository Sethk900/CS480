Revision of the endemic Taiwanese millipede genus Aponedyopus Verhoeff, 1939, with descriptions of two new species (Diplopoda, Polydesmida, Paradoxosomatidae). Advances in the systematica of Diplopoda IIIAbstract The millipede genus Aponedyopus is endemic to Taiwan and contains three species. All previously described nominal species are considered to represent one species: Aponedyopus montanus Verhoeff, 1939 (the type species), including Aponedyopus reesi (Wang, 1957) and Aponedyopus maculatus Takakuwa, 1942, syn. n. Two further species are described as new: Aponedyopus similis sp. n. and Aponedyopus latilobatus sp. n. The genus is re-diagnosed, all of its three species are keyed, and their distributions mapped.
