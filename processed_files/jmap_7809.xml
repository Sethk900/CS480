The recent expansion of an avian invasive species (the Cattle Egret Ardea ibis) in AlgeriaThis study identifies new information on the recent distribution of an invasive bird species, the Cattle  Egret Ardea ibis, in Algeria. Breeding and wintering distributions as weil as breeding numbers were  obtained from large-scale surveys in 1999 and 2007, and from historical data. Between 1999 and 2007,  the total number of colonies found increased from 51 to 87, and most were located in the northem part of  the countcy. The breeding distribution area, confined to the coastal areas in the 1970s, has shifted further  south, and reached the northern part of the Sahara since the 2000s. Most colonies were established  during the period 1980-1995. The oldest colonies were generally larger than the recent ones. The  number of colonies increased by 83% between 1999 and 2007 in the 12 administrative units (wilayas)  surveyed. The number of breeding pairs increased from 7765 in 1999 to 28544 in 2007, corresponding to  an annual population growth rate of 17.7%. The changes in distribution and population dynamics since  the 1970s and the potential factors affecting these changes are discussed.
