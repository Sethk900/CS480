Depth structuring of pelagic copepod biodiversity in waters adjacent to an Eastern Indian Ocean coral reefWe compared pelagic copepod communities at three (400+ m) stations adjacent to Scott Reef (14°S), a shelf-break reef in Australia's Indian Ocean territory, with those within the shallow (c.50 m) atoll lagoon. The metazooplankton assemblage sampled by our 100-μm multinet system was dominated by small (< 1.0 mm) copepods. We identified over 220 copepod species, belonging to five of the nine orders. Of these, 68 (31%) are new records for Australian waters and at least 14 are likely to be undescribed. Redundancy analysis indicated that depth stratum was the most important determinant of community structure: distinct communities were associated with the epipelagic (within which the atoll lagoon community was further distinguished by reef-associated copepods), the chlorophyll maximum/thermocline, the upper mesopelagic and the hyper-benthos. The family Oncaeidae was highly speciose (> 52 taxa) and progressively more important with increasing depth.
