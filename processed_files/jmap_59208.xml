Interactive Irrigation Tool for Simulating Smart Irrigation Technologies in Lawn TurfAbstractA simple model was developed to explore the effect of water saving technologies by simulating the soil water balance in a lawn turfgrass system based on site-specific soil characteristics, irrigation schedule, real-time weather data, and irrigation technology (i.e., time-based irrigation, time-based irrigation with rain sensor, time-based irrigation with soil water sensor, and evapotranspiration controller). The model has been integrated into an interactive tool for homeowners and landscape professionals to evaluate and improve irrigation scheduling. Model coding was tested by using two software programs and verified by using a field data set. Average absolute differences between measured and simulated irrigation and deep percolation by event were different among irrigation technologies, ranging from 0 to 0.46 and 0.19 to 2.03 cm, respectively. The model is available as an online tool through the Florida Automated Weather Network using Google technology. The free tool requires minimum user input, offers default values, and generates an updated e-mail by using the input data and real-time weather on a weekly basis.
