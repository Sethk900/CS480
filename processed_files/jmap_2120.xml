Warming prevents the elevated CO2-induced reduction in available soil nitrogen in a temperate, perennial grassland.Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO<sub>2</sub>]) has the potential to stimulate ecosystem productivity and sink strength, reducing the effects of carbon (C) emissions on climate. In terrestrial ecosystems, increasing [CO<sub>2</sub>] can reduce soil nitrogen (N) availability to plants, preventing the stimulation of ecosystem C assimilation; a process known as progressive N limitation. Using ion exchange membranes to assess the availability of dissolved organic N, ammonium and nitrate, we found that CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment in an Australian, temperate, perennial grassland did not increase plant productivity, but did reduce soil N availability, mostly by reducing nitrate availability. Importantly, the addition of 2 Â°C warming prevented this effect while warming without CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment did not significantly affect N availability. These findings indicate that warming could play an important role in the impact of [CO<sub>2</sub>] on ecosystem N cycling, potentially overturning CO<sub>2</sub>-induced effects in some ecosystems.
