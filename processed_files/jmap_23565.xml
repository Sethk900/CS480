Both sexes have completely reduced hindwings and strongly reduced forewings. The adults are active in February, jumping amongst Carex physodes M. Bieb. and being associated with rodent burrows. The new species is similar to Metanarsia trisignella Bidzilya, 2008, in the male genitalia. Both species are placed here provisionally in Catatinagma Rebel, 1903, and their position within Apatetrini is briefly discussed. The adult and the genitalia of both sexes are illustrated, and the behaviour of the new species is described.
