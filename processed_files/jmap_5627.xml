Observations on the â€œtenuis groupâ€ (Eutardigrada, Macrobiotidae) and description of a new Macrobiotus speciesA new species of the tardigrade genus Macrobiotus is described. The species, designated M. ciprianoi n. sp., was isolated from a mixture of Provence broom leaf litter and mosses, and from rock mosses collected in the Sierra de Guadarrama, Madrid (Spain). Given that Macrobiotus ciprianoi n. sp. shares several characters to members of the â€œtenuis groupâ€, we assessed the taxonomic homogeneity of the group. The new species differs from those of the â€œtenuis groupâ€ according to a unique set of characters related with claw shape, features of the buccalâ€pharyngeal apparatus, and egg morphology. Our analysis of holotypes and/or paratypes of â€œtenuis groupâ€ species and other Macrobiotus species with similar characters (M. bondavallii and M. caelicola) reflects the heterogeneity of this group of species as currently described.
