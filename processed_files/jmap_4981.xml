Life cycle and behaviour of Charoxus spinifer and Charoxus major (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae: Aleocharinae), predators of fig wasps (Hymenoptera: Agaonidae)Charoxus spinifer is associated in southern Florida with native fig trees (Ficus aurea and Ficus citrifolia). Winged adult beetles, 3.0–3.6 mm long, mate on Ficus twigs outside the syconia (fruits), and enter the syconia through holes cut by male pollinating wasps. Adults and larvae eat adult wasps within the syconia. Ovaries hold few, large, mature eggs. Larvae develop through three instars. Fully grown larvae abandon the syconia, drop to the ground, burrow to a depth of 1.5–3.7 cm, spin a silken cocoon, and pupate. Pupal duration is 8–9 days. Larval populations are highest in May, when penultimate stage syconia (phase D) are most abundant, but were detected in all months except June. Charoxus major is reported from Veracruz, associated with Ficus lapathifolia. Its adults extract wasp occupants of galled fig ovaries within syconia, and its eggs were found singly in empty galls.
