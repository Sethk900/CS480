Evaluating Basking-Habitat Deficiency in the Threatened Eastern Massasauga RattlesnakeWoody plant succession is hypothesized to threaten many reptile populations by reducing the amount of solar energy available for thermoregulation. Mitigation via vegetation management is often recommended; however, the need for such management practices rarely has been evaluated. We examined the need for basking-site enhancement for the eastern massasauga rattlesnake (Sistrurus c. catenatus; hereafter EMR) in New York, USA, where only 2 populations remain: one at an open-canopy site and another at a closed-canopy site. Microhabitat temperatures were substantially lower at the closed-canopy site, where EMRs selected the warmest available basking sites. Eastern massasauga rattlesnakes in the open-canopy population selected basking sites that afforded greater cryptic cover. We recommend experimental reduction of shrub cover to improve EMR basking habitat at the closed-canopy site. More generally, we caution that management efforts to reduce shrub cover for basking EMRs should maintain adequate cryptic cover.
