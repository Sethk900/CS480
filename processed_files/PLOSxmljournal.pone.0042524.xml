Studies done over the last decade have shown that specific, and often, predictable random and non-random factors could be responsible for that process. These studies have also motivated a â€œstructureâ€“functionâ€ paradigm that is yet to be resolved. Thus, elucidating the factors that affect community assembly in the bioreactors is necessary for predicting fluctuations in community structure and function. For this study activated sludge samples were collected during a one-year period from two geographically distant CAS bioreactors of different size. Combining community fingerprinting analysis and operational parameters data with a robust statistical analysis, we aimed to identify relevant links between system performance and bacterial community diversity and dynamics. In addition to revealing a significant Î²-diversity between the bioreactorsâ€™ communities, results showed that the largest bioreactor had a less dynamic but more efficient and diverse bacterial community throughout the study. The statistical analysis also suggests that deterministic factors, as opposed to stochastic factors, may have a bigger impact on the community structure in the largest bioreactor. Furthermore, the community seems to rely mainly on mechanisms of resistance and functional redundancy to maintain functional stability. We suggest that the ecological theories behind the Island Biogeography model and the species-area relationship were appropriate to predict the assembly of bacterial communities in these CAS bioreactors. These results are of great importance for engineers and ecologists as they reveal critical aspects of CAS systems that could be applied towards improving bioreactor design and operation.WWTP: Wastewater Treatment Plant.BOD: Biochemical Oxygen Demand; TSS: Total Suspended Solids; ADF: Average Daily Flow; MLD: Mega Liters per Day; HRT: Hydraulic Retention Time; SRT: Solids Retention Time.Percentage values represent the difference between measured influent and effluent concentrations of TSS and BOD for both WWTP: HC (â€¢), LC (â–ª).CAS: Conventional Activated Sludge; OTU: Operational Taxonomic Unit.WWTP: Wastewater Treatment Plant.TRFs: Terminal Restriction Fragments; Values in parentheses represent the total number of distinctive TRFs detected per restriction enzyme in both bacterial communities combined during the 12 samplings times.As inferred from the RÃ©nyi profiles, the bacterial community from the HC bioreactor was consistently more diverse than the community from the LC bioreactor across all diversity indices represented by the alpha-values. Also, it seems from the shape of the profiles that the populations in the HC bioreactor were more evenly distributed.The ordination was based on square-root transformed data of the measured operational parameters (arrows): BOD-influent (A), Flow (B), F/M (C), HRT (D), NO<sub>3</sub><sup>â€“</sup>N (E), pH (F), PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3âˆ’</sup> (G), SRT (H), Temperature (I), TSS-influent (J); and the T-RFLP abundance profiles from both CAS bioreactors: HC (â€¢), LC (â–ª). Numbers next to symbols indicate the relative sampling time. An unrestricted Monte-Carlo permutation test was performed (1000 permutations) to determine the statistical significance of the relationship between the environmental variables and the canonical axes.In this study, we aimed to assess the dynamics of bacterial communities in two full-scale CAS bioreactors and evaluate the relationship between the WWTP performance and the behavior of the communities, relying primarily on a time series of T-RFLP profiles of community structure. By combining the T-RFLP profiles with a robust statistical analysis we were able to expose differences between the bacterial communities in the bioreactors in terms of composition, diversity and response to operational parameters. We were also able to link the performance of the systems and the mechanisms driving community assembly in the bioreactors. Overall, the two original hypotheses that motivated this study were largely supported by the results.(PDF)(PDF)
