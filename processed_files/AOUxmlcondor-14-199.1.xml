We examined and compared 4 mitochondrial loci of the near threatened Short-tailed Babbler ( Pellorneum malaccense ), a rainforest understory bird, between a highly fragmented population in Singapore and populations from elsewhere in the Sundaic region. We found that the fragmented Singaporean population is genetically impoverished, with &lt;20&percnt; of the intrapopulation genetic diversity present in a comparable sample from Borneo within intact forest. Differences in haplotype diversity among Singaporean sites of occurrence suggest that there may be extremely poor genetic diversity and connectivity among Singaporean subpopulations. These findings highlight the importance of connectivity in maintaining population genetic diversity in urban tropical forest patches. Our results also corroborate previous findings that there are 3 deeply diverged lineages of Short-tailed Babbler across the Sundaic region.  El an&aacute;lisis de la diversidad gen&eacute;tica de una poblaci&oacute;n puede ser &uacute;til en la identificaci&oacute;n de algunos de los efectos silenciosos de la fragmentaci&oacute;n del h&aacute;bitat. En este estudio examinamos cuatro loci mitocondriales de  Pellorneum malaccense , un ave casi amenazada del sotobosque de bosques lluviosos, y los contrastamos entre una poblaci&oacute;n &aacute;ltamente fragmentada en Singapur y poblaciones de otras localidades en la regi&oacute;n de la Sonda. Se encontr&oacute; que la poblaci&oacute;n fragmentada de Singapur est&aacute; gen&eacute;ticamente empobrecida, y cuenta con menos del 20&percnt; de la diversidad gen&eacute;tica encontrada en una muestra comparable de una localidad en Borneo con bosques intactos. Las diferencias en la diversidad haplot&iacute;pica entre sitios en Singapur sugieren que la diversidad gen&eacute;tica y la conectividad entre sub-poblaciones del &aacute;rea podr&iacute;an ser extremadamente pobres. Estos resultados resaltan la importancia de la conectividad en el mantenimiento de la diversidad gen&eacute;tica de las poblaciones dentro de parches urbanos de bosques tropicales. Nuestros resultados corroboran evidencia previa sobre la existencia de tres linajes de divergencia profunda en  Pellorneum malaccense  a trav&eacute;s de la regi&oacute;n de la Sonda.

The island of Singapore (103&deg;50&prime;E, 1&deg;20&prime;N), lying within the Sundaic biodiversity hotspot ( Myers et al. 2000 ,  Brooks et al. 2002 ), stands out as the most urbanized country in the rapidly developing region of Southeast Asia ( Sodhi et al. 2004b ). It is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, with an average of &gt;7,000 persons km &minus;2 . Since 1819, &gt;95&percnt; of Singapore's original vegetation cover has been lost to urbanization; &lt;10&percnt; of the remaining forest is primary ( Brook et al. 2003 ). Over 50&percnt; of the remaining local biodiversity is now restricted to forest reserves, which cover &lt;0.25&percnt; of Singapore's total land area ( Brook et al. 2003 ).  Habitat loss and fragmentation have a variety of effects on species diversity ( Tilman et al. 2001 ,  Jackson and Sax 2010 ). Although immediate changes in species composition are often well documented following habitat loss, silent processes such as extinction debt are frequently overlooked ( Hanski and Ovaskainen 2002 ). Extinction debt can operate over many years, during which deleterious factors act to decimate remnant populations in a habitat. These factors include invasions by alien species, habitat deterioration, edge effects, and reduced population genetic diversity within small populations ( Brook et al. 2008 ). Many forest-dependent species in Singapore and other recently urbanized areas may currently undergo extinction debt ( Kuussaari et al. 2009 ). However, to our knowledge, no avian genetic studies have specifically addressed this phenomenon in tropical urbanized areas&mdash;indicating an urgent research need.  The Short-tailed Babbler ( Pellorneum malaccense , previously classified as  Malacocincla malaccensis ; see  Moyle et al. 2012 ) is one of the few truly forest-dependent species not currently listed as threatened in Singapore ( Yong 2009 ), although it is listed as globally &ldquo;near threatened&rdquo; by the IUCN. This insectivorous understory bird appears to be declining in numbers because of habitat destruction throughout its range ( BirdLife International 2001 ), which includes the Thai-Malay peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo, and smaller satellite islands ( Figure 1 ). In Singapore it occurs only within a few of the more sizable and interconnected remnants of the island's nature reserves ( Figure 2 ;  Sodhi et al. 2004a ,  Yong 2009 ). These remnants were contiguous until the early 1990s, which may explain the present distribution ( Sodhi et al. 2004a ).

Numbered localities are (1) Upper Seletar Reservoir Park ( n  &equals; 6), (2) Upper Peirce Reservoir Park ( n  &equals; 10), and (3) Southern CCNR ( n  &equals; 12). Size of circle corresponds to sample size. For details on each haplotype, see Appendix  Table 5 . Map modified from  Yee et al. (2011) . One of the sampled reserves, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, is not shown because of lower sample size.  Understanding connectivity between patches in forest-dependent species such as the Short-tailed Babbler is important for ensuring their survival in urbanized and increasingly fragmented landscapes. Insectivorous understory species are known to be poor dispersers, so dispersal barriers can easily result in small, isolated populations susceptible to genetic drift ( Burney and Brumfield 2009 ,  Pavlacky et al. 2009 ).  Lim and Sheldon (2011)  analyzed the evolutionary history of Short-tailed Babblers across the Sundaic region but had limited sampling from highly fragmented patches such as Singapore. Other studies have looked into the population demographics and distribution of the Short-tailed Babbler within Singapore ( Sodhi 2002 ,  Sodhi et al. 2004a ,  Castelletta et al. 2005 ), but were conducted without recourse to molecular methods to scan for signals of low genetic diversity.  Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype number and diversity data can reflect demographics of avian populations that have undergone declines ( Jackson et al. 2013 ). Therefore, we investigated the placement of the Singaporean population within a phylogenetic framework and compared levels of mtDNA population-genetic diversity between Singaporean and other regional populations. In particular, we directly contrasted the Short-tailed Babblers of Singapore island with a comparable Bornean population from intact forest. We also made comparisons among the Singaporean subpopulations to identify those at particular risk.  Short-tailed Babblers have a limited distribution in Singapore, and we chose study sites that had confirmed sightings of the species. Targeted mist-netting was done between April 2013 and January 2014 at 3 old, secondary forest fragments within the Central Catchment Nature Reserve (CCNR) and 1 fragment within the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve (BTNR). Sites within the 2 nature reserves covered during this period include Southern CCNR (with 4 different sampling localities), Northern CCNR (comprising Upper Peirce Reservoir Park, Upper Seletar Reservoir Park, and multiple sampling localities within each park) and Dairy Farm Nature Park ( Figure 2 ). Forest fragments within the Western Catchment could not be surveyed because they are restricted military training areas.  Blood samples from live captured birds were obtained by brachial venipuncture. An ethanol-soaked cotton swab was used to sterilize the area surrounding the brachial vein. A TERUMO 1-cc TB Syringe was then used to pierce the brachial vein, and blood was collected using 50-&mu;L Drummond Short-Length Microcaps heparin-free capillaries. Blood was then transferred to a 2-mL Eppendorf tube containing 50 &mu;L of 100&percnt; ethanol and topped up such that the blood:ethanol ratio was between 1:15 and 1:20. Pressure was applied to the puncture using the ethanol swab following blood collection in order to clot the wound. Blood was not collected from birds displaying brood patches or juvenile characteristics. Any feathers shed during processing of birds were also collected in zip-lock plastic bags because the calami often contain small quantities of extractable DNA. The Eppendorf tubes and zip-lock bags were labeled and stored in a freezer at a temperature of &minus;20&deg;C in order to prevent degradation of DNA. Birds were fitted with alloy bands bearing unique numbers on their tarsus; this provided a technique for tracking birds and identifying recaptured individuals to avoid resampling of the same individual. Following processing, birds were released at the site of capture. A total of 29 individuals were sampled: 28 from CCNR and 1 individual from BTNR ( Figure 2 ). A total of 2,614 mist-netting hours were completed in Singapore over the whole study period.  Additional mtDNA sequences from  Lim and Sheldon (2011)  were downloaded from GenBank for Short-tailed Babbler populations from across the region (for full sample list, see Appendix  Table 5 ). Besides Singapore, areas sampled included Terengganu in peninsular Malaysia ( n  &equals; 4) and Lingkung district in Sumatra ( n  &equals; 2), as well as several localities in Sarawak ( n  &equals; 21) and Sabah ( n  &equals; 17) on the island of Borneo ( Figure 1 ).  DNA extractions were made with GeneAll DNA Purification kits, following the protocol for body fluid in ethanol. Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were conducted in a C1000 Thermal Cycler for 4 different mitochondrial genes, using the following primers and conditions: Cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) was amplified following  Hebert et al. (2004) ; the hypervariable mitochondrial control region (D-loop) was amplified following (1995); NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) was amplified following  Sorenson et al. (1999) ; and cytochrome  b  (cyt  b ) was amplified following  Cibois et al. (1999)  and  Dong et al. (2010) , using the conditions stated for ND2. PCR amplifications were done in 20-&mu;L reaction volumes, which comprised 2 &mu;L 10X  Taq  PCR buffer, 1.2 &mu;L MgCl2 (25 mM), 1 &mu;L of each primer (10 &mu;m), 0.4 &mu;L Fermentas  Taq  polymerase, 2 &mu;L mtDNA template, and 11.6 &mu;L MilliQ water. PCR product cleanup was done using ExoSAP-IT, and the BigDye Terminator version 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) was used to cycle-sequence the samples. Sequences were obtained by capillary electrophoresis using an Applied Biosystems 3130xl Genetic Analyzer.  DNA sequences were assembled with CodonCode Aligner version 4.1 and aligned with MEGA version 6.06 using ClustalW ( Larkin et al. 2007 ,  Tamura et al. 2013 ). Two subsets of data were created using the sampled loci. The first subset (2,418 base pairs &lsqb;bp&rsqb; in length), which maximized the number of loci analyzed, focused on Singaporean samples and involved the concatenation of all 4 loci previously mentioned ( n  &equals; 24); the second subset (1,208 bp in length), which maximized the number of individuals analyzed, included samples from different parts of the Sundaic region and involved the concatenation of 2 genes, ND2 and cyt  b  ( n  &equals; 79). The Chinese Hwamei (  Garrulax canorus  ) was used as an outgroup. MEGA was employed to construct phylogenetic trees using maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML). For each analysis, 1,000 bootstrap replicates were run. MP was run with all sites used for gap treatment, with tree bisection and reconnection as the tree search method and with all other settings in default mode. The program jModelTest 2.1.4 ( Darriba et al. 2012 ) was used to determine the best evolutionary model for each data subset for ML analysis. The first subset was analyzed using the TrN &plus; G model ( Tamura and Nei 1993 ) and the second using the HKY model ( Hasegawa et al. 1985 ). ML tree topologies were verified using GARLI version 2.0 ( Zwickl 2006 ). All trees were visualized using FigTree version 1.4.0 ( Rambaut 2006 ).  GenAlEx version 6.5 ( Peakall and Smouse 2006 ,  2012 ) was used to generate haplotypes from each data subset. For subsequent analyses, any positions with missing data or ambiguity codes were deleted from the entire dataset, and GenBank samples with imprecise locality data were ignored. Network version 4.6.0 (Fluxus Technology, Clare, Suffolk, UK) was used to generate haplotype networks to determine population genealogies using a median-joining algorithm ( Bandelt et al. 1999 ). For further analysis, the samples were broadly divided into populations originating from 5 different regions: Singapore, peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, Sabah, and Sarawak. DnaSP version 5.10.01 ( Librado and Rozas 2009 ) was used to calculate  F  ST , raw sequence divergence, and nucleotide diversity between and within populations across the Sundaic region and between and within subpopulations across 3 localities in Singapore (Upper Seletar Reservoir Park, Upper Peirce Reservoir Park, and Southern CCNR). Distribution of variation within and among populations in Southeast Asia was estimated using analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) in ARLEQUIN version 3.11 ( Excoffier and Lischer 2010 ), using the settings of pairwise differences and 3,000 permutations.  In order to contrast Singaporean haplotype diversity with that of a comparable regional population, subsampling and rarefaction techniques were used. We compared Singapore with an overseas locality of similar size with intact forest, namely the Tawau Hills in Sabah. The island of Singapore (~580 km 2  in area prior to modern land reclamation and with a human population as small as 10,000 at the start of the 19th century;  Crawfurd 1830 ) was fully forested until recently and, thus, would have been similar with respect to population size and dynamics to the forest block of Tawau Hills (4&deg;27&prime;7.62&prime;&prime;N, 117&deg;56&prime;53.90&prime;&prime;E; ~20 km latitudinally and ~25 km longitudinally). Both forest tracts were part of a larger forest matrix during the past few thousand years; Singapore was connected to present-day Sumatra ~9,000 yr ago and to peninsular Malaysia &lt;6,000 yr ago ( Voris 2000 ,  Bintanja et al. 2005 ). Thus, we expect that differences in Short-tailed Babbler population genetics between both sites are mostly due to recent habitat conversions in Singapore. The Singaporean population was subsampled and rarefied following  Gotelli and Colwell (2001) , using 100 bootstrap replicates in each case. Network 4.6.0 was used to draw haplotype networks for the 2 populations in order to visualize differences in population structure.  Both ML and MP analyses generated similar majority-rule consensus topologies. Three well-supported clades were formed, with the western populations (Singapore, peninsular Malaysia, and Sumatra) emerging as an independent clade nested within the Sarawak clade ( Figure 3 ). The Sabah clade was sister to and deeply diverged from the western and Sarawak clades, respectively. Within the western clade, the Sumatran and peninsular Malaysian populations were respectively resolved as sister to the Singapore population. The nestedness of the western clade within Sarawak may be an artifact of low resolution from sequencing loci from a single linkage group; thus, it has poor ML bootstrap support ( Figure 3 ). The parsimony network generated similar results, with 3 broad clades formed across Southeast Asia ( Figure 1 ). Single-locus trees generated similar tree topologies and are not shown.  Phylogram of regional populations of Short-tailed Babblers from across the Sundaic region. Major nodes are annotated with maximum-likelihood/maximum parsimony values.  Results from the AMOVA showed that the overwhelming majority (87.23&percnt;) of mtDNA variation occurred among rather than within clades ( Table 1 ). Observations of deep divergence between clades were corroborated by a matrix of raw sequence divergences ( Table 2 ), with 10&ndash;30 times more divergence between clades than between populations within the western clade. Raw sequence divergence between populations of the western clade and Sarawak was consistently &lt;4&percnt;, whereas that between the western clade and Sabah exceeded 9&percnt;, underscoring the deep divergence of Sabah ( Table 2 ).

Matrix of  F  ST  (above diagonal), raw sequence divergences among regional populations (below diagonal), and raw sequence divergences/nucleotide diversity within clades and populations (along diagonal, bold) of Short-tailed Babblers.  A total of 39 different haplotypes were identified across Southeast Asia ( Figure 1 ), with the highest haplotype diversity occurring in Sabah and the lowest in Singapore (0.971 and 0.794, respectively;  Table 3 ). Low sample sizes in peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra made it difficult to assess diversity across these sites. None of the haplotypes occurring in Singapore were found in any other region.  Comparison of genetic diversity markers across selected clades and populations of Short-tailed Babblers.  The Short-tailed Babblers in Singapore appeared to be genetically impoverished, showing limited population structure ( Figure 1 ). This observation is supported by intrapopulation sequence divergence values that are &lt;20&percnt; of those obtained from populations in Sabah and Sarawak ( Table 2 ), as well as comparatively low levels of nucleotide diversity and polymorphic sites ( Table 3 ). Comparison of haplotype diversity between Singapore and Tawau Hills in Sabah showed that the latter had higher relative haplotype diversity ( Figure 4 ). Additionally, the maximum pairwise difference observed between individuals sampled from Singapore was 2 bp out of 1,208 bp (0.00166&percnt;), compared to 11 bp (0.00911&percnt;) for Tawau Hills. The Tawau Hills dataset displayed a much more unbiased distribution than the Singapore dataset, with 7 haplotypes formed from the 9 individuals sampled, no dominance of any one haplotype, and more structure between haplotypes. By contrast, Singapore haplotype distribution was skewed, with ~19 individuals (almost 60&percnt; of the total sample size for the island) belonging to the 2 most common haplotypes and limited structure seen within the haplotype network ( Figure 5 ).

Median-joining haplotype network for Short-tailed Babblers from ( A ) Singapore and ( B ) Tawau Hills, based on cyt  b &ndash;ND2 sequences.  Five additional haplotypes were identified for Singapore following the concatenated 4-locus analysis, with 7 of the ~2,500 bp proving to be variable. Almost 30&percnt; of the Singaporean individuals belonged to a single haplotype (STBH3, represented by red in  Figure 2 ), while 5 individuals were singletons possessing unique haplotypes. Despite comparable sample sizes, Northern CCNR displayed twice as many haplotypes as Southern CCNR ( Figure 2 ). Additionally, 6 of the northern haplotypes were unrepresented in the southern population. STBH3 was the dominant haplotype identified in Southern CCNR but was represented by only 1 sample from the Northern CCNR. Based on this analysis, Upper Peirce Reservoir Park appeared to possess the greatest haplotype diversity ( Figure 2 ). Comparatively higher  F  ST  values between the Northern CCNR localities (Upper Peirce Reservoir Park and Upper Seletar Reservoir Park) and Southern CCNR further highlight the isolation of the Southern CCNR fragment ( Table 4 ).  Matrix of  F  ST  (above diagonal), raw sequence divergences among Singaporean localities (below diagonal), and raw sequence divergences/nucleotide diversity (along diagonal, bold) within Singaporean localities, respectively.  Mean sequence divergence between Sabah and other populations was 8.5&ndash;9.6&percnt;, a figure far exceeding mtDNA coding gene divergences often observed between avian sister species, which average around 4.3&percnt; ( Hebert et al. 2004 ,  Kerr et al. 2007 ), corroborating previous findings of a deep Sabah divergence by  Lim and Sheldon (2011) . Based on the mitochondrial clock rate of ~2&percnt; divergence Ma &minus;1  ( Lovette 2004 ), it appears that the last time there was gene flow between birds in Sabah and elsewhere in the region was &gt;4.5 mya ( Table 2 ). The universality of this clock has been hotly debated but is validated for a wide range of avian taxa ( Weir and Schluter 2008 ) and is here used for temporal divergence estimation.  A lack of shared haplotypes across regional sampling localities and high  F  ST  values suggest that there may be no pronounced recent gene flow among the 3 clades, corroborating previous observations by  Lim and Sheldon (2011) . This is consistent with the hypothesis of high levels of lineage divergence in sedentary tropical forest birds with low dispersal rates ( Moore et al. 2008 ,  Burney and Brumfield 2009 ).  The Sundaic region lies on a shallow continental shelf and has a complex geological and climatic history. During the Pleistocene (starting 2.6 mya), cyclical changes in climate have affected the region by causing the sequential rise and fall of sea levels and corresponding changes in the total immersed land area ( Hanebuth et al. 2000 ,  Voris 2000 ). Models reveal that a large block of lowland evergreen rainforest existed at the center of the shelf between peninsular Malaysia and what today forms the islands of Sumatra and Borneo, potentially allowing for gene flow between the regions ( Cannon et al. 2009 ). Despite the frequency of land connections over the past 2.8 million years, levels of sequence divergence indicate that differentiation of the population in Sabah from the other 2 clades predates the Pleistocene. This means that enough differences accumulated before the Pleistocene era between Sabah and the other 2 clades to prevent any detectable gene flow between them, even when they may have occupied adjacent geographic space during glacial maxima.  The case is different for Sarawak and the western clade. Sequence divergence values (3.6&ndash;3.9&percnt;;  Table 2 ) suggest that gene flow occurred between these clades up until approximately 1.8&ndash;2.0 mya at the beginning of the Pleistocene, and then ceased or eased off, possibly due to a gradual accumulation of differences during each allopatric isolation event that eventually led to reproductive isolation.  Based on the mtDNA distances (0.6&ndash;0.9&percnt;;  Table 2 ), populations forming the western clade date back to divergence events as recent as 300,000&ndash;400,000 yr ago (Late Pleistocene), which is strong evidence for the Singaporean, peninsular Malaysian, and Sumatran populations together forming a distinct, genetically more cohesive clade. This finding is unsurprising given the shallow, narrow straits and short distances that separate these land masses ( Voris 2000 ).  The genetic distinctness of the 2 Bornean clades, originally highlighted by  Lim and Sheldon (2011) , may indicate that these clades represent true biological species ( Mayr 1942 ,  Wheeler and Meier 2000 ), given that they appear to have been genetically isolated from peninsular and Sumatran populations since at least the Early Pleistocene. Further investigation into the bioacoustics and morphology of these forms is ongoing and will demonstrate whether Short-tailed Babblers form multiple cryptic species ( Rheindt et al. 2008 ).  In the 2-gene regional analysis, Singaporean samples accounted for only 13&percnt; of the haplotypes that were identified across Southeast Asia, despite forming 42&percnt; of the total sample size for the study ( Figure 1 ). The Singaporean population appears to be a genetically cohesive unit, displaying &lt;20&percnt; of the intrapopulation variability seen in the Tawau Hills population ( Figure 5 ). Singapore and Tawau Hills would have possessed similarly sized forest tracts and, thus, similar populations until as recently as 200 yr ago; on a longer time scale, both were fragments of larger forests belonging to the Sundaic landmass. The sequence divergence values between Singapore, Sumatra, and peninsular Malaysia are similar to those between samples collected from within Sabah or Sarawak ( Table 2 ). This shows the cohesiveness of the western clade on larger time scales and provides a context for interpreting the exceptionally low intrapopulation variability seen in the current Singapore population, when compared to Tawau Hills.  Analysis within Singapore revealed that subpopulations in Northern CCNR have twice the haplotype diversity of subpopulations in Southern CCNR ( Figure 2 ). At this spatial scale, haplotypes are usually evenly distributed across habitat patches ( Toon et al. 2007 ). The absence of such a pattern may indicate that there is limited exchange between the northern and southern regions of the CCNR, possibly because subpopulations are constrained to fragments as a result of their inability to disperse across barriers such as reservoirs and golf courses ( Figure 2 ).  It has been shown that low genetic variability does not affect all taxa equally ( Visscher et al. 2001 ,  Milot et al. 2007 ) and may be a characteristic of a species that experienced an ancient population bottleneck ( Shankaranarayanan et al. 1997 ). However, given the high degree of genetic variability of Short-tailed Babblers in a comparable population in Tawau Hills in Sabah ( Figure 4 ), there is evidence supporting the inference that the genetically impoverished nature of the Singaporean population is mostly a result of human-induced fragmentation and decreasing population size over the past 2 centuries (along with its recent status as an island, which reduces dispersal rates). The reduced population size and fragmented landscape could have resulted in loss of genetic diversity through genetic drift. One might argue that an ancient bottleneck affected only the western clade of the species. However, this inference seems unlikely given the intrapopulation sequence divergence values obtained from samples from Terengganu in peninsular Malaysia ( n  &equals; 4), which are more than double the pairwise sequence divergence levels observed in the Singapore population ( Table 2 ).  Although Short-tailed Babblers are forest dependent, and their original habitat is primary Sundaic rainforest, they have shown some adaptability across their range and have been known to utilize tracts of secondary forest. Although the CCNR forms one administrative entity, primary or old secondary forest patches within it are fragmented and isolated (&gt;100 m) from each other by reservoirs, golf courses, and other barriers associated with an urbanized matrix ( Castelletta et al. 2000 ), resulting in a fragmented distribution of the species across the reserve ( Figure 2 ). According to  Yee et al. (2011) , primary lowland dipterocarp forest (118 ha), old secondary forest (995 ha), and freshwater swamp forest (283 ha)&mdash;the 3 vegetation types that Short-tailed Babblers are most likely to utilize&mdash;cover only 1.92&percnt; (1,396 ha) of Singapore's total land area. In a highly urbanized environment such as Singapore, patch size and continuity between good-quality forests appear to be the most important factors in ensuring the persistence of forest-dependent species ( Sodhi et al. 2004b ). Tropical-forest birds may be reluctant to cross matrices as narrow as 100 m ( Stouffer and Bierregaard 1995 ); thus, geographically proximal forest patches connected by wide, good-quality corridors may be the solution to allow forest species in Singapore to survive as metapopulations ( Sieving et al. 2000 ). Poor dispersal abilities of the forest-dependent babblers mean that small populations in forest fragments can no longer be buffered against inbreeding and local extinctions by individuals dispersing from larger patches, as shown by the current skewed distribution of haplotypes across the CCNR ( Figure 2 ).  Using direct comparisons with Tawau Hills population, we showed that the Singaporean population of Short-tailed Babblers is genetically impoverished ( Table 3 ). Such findings bring to attention the requirement for good connectivity between remnant forest patches in Singapore and other urbanizing nations. Enhanced connectivity of good-quality forest within the fragmentation zones of CCNR and BTNR is required in order to establish gene flow between subpopulations on the island, which may help buffer against the decline of population genetic diversity. Efforts must be made in countries with the adequate means and resources, such as Singapore, to preserve the little remaining rainforest cover in a well-connected network in order to increase the efficiency of conservation. The establishment of such corridors will aid in the survival of many taxa suffering from fragmentation and low population sizes.  We thank G. Tang, N. Ng, E. Cros, A. Wee, D. Tan, R. Kolandavelu, Y.
