Measuring forest floor CO2 fluxes in a Douglas-fir forestCO2 exchange was measured on the forest floor of a coastal temperate Douglas-fir forest located near Campbell River, British Columbia, Canada. Continuous measurements were obtained at six locations using an automated chamber system between April and December, 2000. Fluxes were measured every half hour by circulating chamber headspace air through a sampling manifold assembly and a closed-path infrared gas analyzer. Maximum CO2 fluxes measured varied by a factor of almost 3 between the chamber locations, while the highest daily average fluxes observed at two chamber locations occasionally reached values near 15 mumol C m(-2) s(-1). Generally, fluxes ranged between 2 and 10 mumol C m(-2) s(-1) during the measurement period. CO2 flux from the forest floor was strongly related to soil temperature with the highest correlation found with 5 cm depth temperature. A simple temperature dependent exponential model fit to the nighttime fluxes revealed Q(10) values in the normal range of 2-3 during the warmer parts of the year, but values of 4-5 during cooler periods. Moss photosynthesis was negligible in four of the six chambers, while at the other locations, it reduced daytime half-hourly net CO2 flux by about 25%. Soil moisture had very little effect on forest floor CO2 flux. Hysteresis in the annual relationship between chamber fluxes and soil temperatures was observed. Net exchange from the six chambers was estimated to be 1920 +/- 530 g C m(-2) per year, the higher estimates exceeding measurement of ecosystem respiration using year-round eddy correlation above the canopy at this site. This discrepancy is attributed to the inadequate number of chambers to obtain a reliable estimate of the spatial average soil CO2 flux at the site and uncertainty in the eddy covariance respiration measurements.
