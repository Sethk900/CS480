Effects of thermal regime on mayfly assemblages in mountain streamsThe variation in thermal regime and elevation among streams in the Sawtooth Mountains of Idaho, USA was used to test hypotheses about forces structuring larval mayfly assemblages. Sites above and below lakes were included to maximize variation in thermal regime. Forty-five sites were sampled for mayfly larvae and their summer thermal regime was measured. Ordination methods were used to analyze variation in the mayfly assemblages. Principal components analysis showed that mayfly assemblages were strongly and consistently affected by lakes within the stream system, apparently through the effects of lakes on stream temperature. Redundancy analysis explained 51% of the variation in assemblages and identified maximum water temperature and elevation as strong predictors of mayfly assemblages. Elevation influenced assemblage structure independently of summer maximum water temperature, suggesting that air temperature or some other elevation-dependent feature is also important. As predicted by the River Continuum Concept, mayfly diversity increased with increasing maximum daily range in temperature.
