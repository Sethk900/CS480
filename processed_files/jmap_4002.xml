Faunal nestedness and speciesâ€“area relationship for small non-volant mammals in â€œsky islandsâ€ of northern VenezuelaWe study the biogeography of small non-volant mammals in mesic montane sky islands of northern Venezuela. Fieldwork, examination of museum specimens, and critical use of literature yielded species lists for the Cordillera de MÃ©rida, Cordillera de la Costa, SerranÃ­a de San Luis, and Cerro Santa Ana. Fieldwork confirmed the species known from Cerro Santa Ana and added 12 species for the SerranÃ­a de San Luis. Richness decreases with smaller area. Furthermore, the faunas are highly nested, with taxa dropping out at successive depressions. Species deviating from nestedness provide a signal indicative of in situ speciation in rodents but not in marsupials.
