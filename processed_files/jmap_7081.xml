Life history traits of shrimps (Decapoda: Palaemonidae) of Amazonian inland waters and their Phylogenetic interpretationAmazonian shrimps (Decapoda, Palaemonidae) of several genera from the generally nutrientâ€poor, acid waters of the Rio Negro basin show two different breeding patterns: in the annually inundated (Jan./Feb. to Sept./Oct.) lowland forest (= â€œigapÃ³") they breed during a period with rising and high water levels only (Dec. to July); in the headwater streams draining the â€œterra firmeâ€; (= regions not subject to annual inundations), the same species breed continuously the year round. All species from these nutrientâ€poor and hence, planktonâ€deficient, waters have abreviated life cycles with 1â€“3 benthic larval stages; this includes several Macrobrachium species. However, Macrobrachium amazonicum from the planktonâ€rich floodplain lakes, which are fed by the richer water of the Amazon river, maintains the marine pattern of development with numerous stages of filterâ€feeding, planktonic larvae. Phylogenetic convergence (several genera developing independently the same adaptive pattern) and divergence (the same genus/species exhibiting different patterns in different environments) are discussed in relation to recent, general molecular genetics.
