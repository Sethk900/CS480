Complex Locations* Biogeographic classification of the Neotropical Leptophlebiidae (Ephemeroptera) based upon geological centers of ancestral origin and ecologyThirtyâ€four genera belonging to the Gondwanian subfamily Atalophlebiinae are known from the Neotropics. Development of the lower Central American isthmus was marked only by dispersal of Gondwanian Atalophlebiinae from South America into Central America. No member of the Laurasian subfamily, the Leptophlebiinae, has dispersed from North America into Central or South America. The Antilles were colonized entirely by Atalophlebiinae from South and Central America. Genera of Neotropical Atalophlebiinae are placed into one of two faunal components: either the Patagonian Shield, South Andean, Coldâ€Adapted Genera; or the Guiana & Brazilian Shields, Warmâ€Adapted Genera. The 10 Patagonian Shield Genera are primarily associated with coldâ€water streams of southern South America. Secondary diversification has occurred in the southern coastal mountains of Brazil, and at high elevations in the central and northern Andes. Phylogenetically, Patagonian Shield Genera are related to diverse genera on several Gondwanian continents. The 24 Warmâ€Adapted Genera share a common heritage stemming from isolation on the Guiana and Brazilian Shields and independent evolution of the Warmâ€Adapted attribute. The Warmâ€Adapted Genera are composed of endemic monophyletic lineages of 2â€“4 genera. Presence of endemic lineages with distant relationships to other Atalophlebiinae reflects the isolation experienced by the Guiana and Brazilian Shields between formation of the northern South Atlantic Ocean 80 mya and the lower Central American isthmus about 5 mya. Warmâ€Adapted Genera are widely distributed in warm to cool streams of the northern Neotropics at elevations below 2000 m. The Warmâ€Adapted Genera are further subdivided based primarily upon the area of maximum species diversification into three faunal elements: the Guiana & Brazilian Shields Associated Genera; the North Andean, Central American Genera, and the Antillean Genera. The 12 Guiana & Brazilian Shields Associated Genera are principally associated with the Guiana and Brazilian Shields and surrounding lowlands such as the Amazon, Sao Francisco and Parana Basins. This faunal element is restricted to elevations of less than 700 m along the eastern slopes of the Andes and does not occur in the Antilles. Maximum species diversification in the 8 North Andean, Central American Genera occurs in the northern Andes and Central America with occasional invasions by isolated speciesâ€groups into the Antilles and/or North America. The 4 Antillean Genera are endemic to the Antilles, and are both geographically and phylogenetically most closely related to taxa of the North Andean, Central American Genera.
