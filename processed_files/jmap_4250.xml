A New Species of Macrelmis Motschulsky from Southeastern Brazil (Coleoptera: Elmidae: Elminae)Macrelmis tijucana, sp. n. is described and illustrated from a first order stream at the Atlantic Forest in Rio de Janeiro State, southeastern Brazil. This species is similar to M. aequalis (Hinton), M. celsa (Hinton), M. pubescens (Grouvelle), M. salti (Hinton), M. sandersoni (Hinton), M. striata (Sharp), and M. striatoidea (Hinton). Macrelmis tijucana, as well as the cited species, does not have sublateral carinae or distinct impressions on the pronotum. The new species can be distinguished from the elmids cited above by the slightly convex scutellum and the morphology of the male genitalia. Taxonomic and habitat notes on the new species are presented.
