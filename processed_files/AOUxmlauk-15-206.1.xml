These relationships between sexual size dimorphism (SSD) and dietary overlap are not well understood in birds. We analyzed differences between the sexes in diet composition, dietary diversity, diet selection, and volume and density of droppings, as well as the dietary overlap between sexes, in the Great Bustard (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Otis tarda</named-content></italic>), the species showing the highest SSD among birds. We discuss the differences that we found in relation to various predictions derived from ecological and physiological differences between the sexes, under the hypothesis that these differences are ultimately determined by the strong SSD of this species. As expected, our best linear mixed-effects food selection models included sex as a main factor explaining differences in diet composition and dietary diversity of Great Bustards throughout the annual cycle. Both sexes were mostly herbivorous, consuming legumes when they were available. Males consumed fewer arthropods, but of significantly larger size, than females. The droppings of males were larger, heavier, and slightly denser than those of females. Males showed higher dietary diversity than females, except during the postmating season. The mean dietary overlap between the sexes was 0.7, one of the smallest values among birds. Overall, our results suggest that the species' extreme SSD along with the distinct reproductive role of each sex might explain the trophic niche divergence in the Great Bustard.En las especies con dimorfismo sexual de tama&ntilde;o, las limitaciones fisiol&oacute;gicas derivadas de las diferencias en el tama&ntilde;o corporal pueden determinar diferentes requerimientos alimentarios y por ende una divergencia del nicho tr&oacute;fico entre los machos y las hembras. Estas relaciones entre el dimorfismo sexual de tama&ntilde;o corporal (DST) y el solapamiento de la dieta no est&aacute;n bien entendidas en las aves.

Como esper&aacute;bamos, nuestros mejores modelos lineales de efectos mixtos de selecci&oacute;n de alimentos incluyeron al sexo como el factor principal que explica las diferencias en la composici&oacute;n y en la diversidad de la dieta en <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">O. tarda</named-content></italic> a lo largo del ciclo anual. Ambos sexos fueron principalmente herb&iacute;voros, consumiendo legumbres cuando estaban disponibles.

Las heces de los machos fueron de mayor tama&ntilde;o y m&aacute;s pesadas, y levemente m&aacute;s densas que las de las hembras. Los machos mostraron una mayor diversidad en la dieta que las hembras, excepto durante la estaci&oacute;n post reproductiva. El solapamiento promedio de la dieta entre los sexos fue 0.7, uno de los valores m&aacute;s peque&ntilde;os entre las aves.

Male-larger dimorphism is extreme in some polygynous species, where sexual selection, operating through male competition and female choice, favors larger males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Shine1">Shine 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Andersson1">Andersson 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Fairbairn2">Fairbairn 2013</xref>). Distinct reproductive roles, sex-specific metabolism, and sexual segregation behavior also contribute to dietary divergence between males and females. In birds, sexual differences in energetic and nutritional requirements are fulfilled through sex-specific habitat selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Pasinelli1">Pasinelli 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Elson1">Elson et al. 2007</xref>), foraging behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-GonzalezSolis1">Gonz&aacute;lez-Sol&iacute;s et al. 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Markman1">Markman et al. 2006</xref>), food intake patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Pepper1">Pepper et al. 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Odden1">Odden et al. 2003</xref>), diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Le1">Le V.

We discuss the differences that we found in relation to various ecological and physiological differences between the sexes, which are ultimately determined by the strong SSD of this species. Indeed, Great Bustards show the most extreme SSD among birds, with adult males being 2.44 times heavier than adult females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Alonso1">Alonso et al. 2009a</xref>). This species is therefore an excellent candidate to investigate SSD-related differences in the diets of males and females.Adult male Great Bustard foraging on legumes, a preferred food source, in central Spain. Photo credit: &copy;Carlos Palac&iacute;nPrevious studies have described the species' diet, but have not analyzed sexual differences in the diet or diet selection patterns of males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Palacios1">Palacios et al. 1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Lucio1">Lucio 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Lane1">Lane et al. 1999</xref>). In a previous study, we found some sexual differences in the diet composition of juvenile Great Bustards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Bravo2">Bravo et al. 2012</xref>), and hypothesized that some of these differences could increase as SSD increases toward adulthood. In contrast, the less-dimorphic North African Houbara Bustard (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Chlamydotis undulata</named-content> undulata</italic>) does not show any apparent dietary divergence between the sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Bourass1">Bourass et al. 2012</xref>).In our study area, Great Bustards of both sexes are partial migrants, with sedentary and migratory individuals living together in the same population. The migratory fraction of the population shows differential migration patterns by sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Alonso3">Alonso et al. 2009b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Palacin1">Palac&iacute;n et al. 2009</xref>), which obviously could lead to sexual differences in their diets. However, here we were interested in unravelling any subtle sexual differences in the diets of Great Bustards living in sympatry throughout the whole year. Like migratory individuals, sedentary individuals sharing the same area also live year-round in sexually segregated flocks, and meet only for mating. Previous studies have concluded that both the sexually differentiated migration patterns of migratory Great Bustards and the marked sexual segregation of sedentary individuals are consequences of the marked SSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Alonso1">Alonso et al. 2009a</xref>, in press, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Palacin1">Palac&iacute;n et al. 2009</xref>), which is ultimately determined by the strong sexual selection operating in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Alonso2">Alonso et al. 2010</xref>). In this study, we suggest that the strong SSD might also be the primary ultimate cause of the dietary divergence between the sexes, probably mediated through subtle spatial segregation and sexual differences in microhabitat selection when males and females share the same area and main habitat (Alonso et al. in press).It is known that males and females of species with marked SSD exploit different food resources, either because they have different nutritional and energetic requirements or because in this way they reduce resource competition between the sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Shine1">Shine 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Ruckstuhl1">Ruckstuhl and Neuhaus 2006</xref>). Also, as a consequence of extreme SSD, many physiological and biochemical processes, such as heartbeat, respiration, and metabolic rate, are expected to show allometric scaling, primarily associated with the ratio between body surface and mass or volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Karasov1">Karasov 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Witmer1">Witmer and Van Soest 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Brown1">Brown and Downs 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-vanGils3">van Gils et al. 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-SantiagoQuesada1">Santiago-Quesada et al. 2009</xref>). Overall energetic requirements should be size-specific, and thus SSD-induced dietary differences between the sexes should be expected in sexually size-dimorphic species, in addition to differences imposed by their typically polygynous breeding system and associated differential reproductive roles of males and females.Therefore, based on the marked sexual segregation in the Great Bustard, in this study we made the following predictions. First, we expected a noticeable divergence between the diets of the sexes due to their extraordinary SSD, and, consequently, a relatively low dietary overlap value compared with other birds with lower SSD. Second, we expected sexual differences in food selection values throughout the year, due to the marked differences in the reproductive roles of this strongly polygynous species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Fairbairn1">Fairbairn 1997</xref>). Third, as prey size is usually related to the size of the predator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Andersson1">Andersson 1994</xref>), we expected differences in the size of prey consumed by males and females. Such differences have been found in the Australian Bustard (<italic>Ardeotis australis</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Ziembicki1">Ziembicki 2010</xref>) and in juvenile Great Bustards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Bravo2">Bravo et al. 2012</xref>), with males consuming bigger prey than females in both cases. Fourth, we expected sexual differences in the physical characteristics of droppings (weight, volume, and density) and in the seasonal patterns of variation in these characteristics. Our rationale was that sexual differences in diet composition could vary among seasons because food availability changes seasonally and nutritional requirements change throughout the annual cycle in a different way for each sex. In addition, dietary changes impose nutritional and physical limits on the digestive system and vice versa. Birds may survive on a low-quality diet by reducing their metabolism and altering their gut morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Geluso1">Geluso and Hayes 1999</xref>) to compensate for decreased digestive efficiency associated with a low-quality diet. Alternatively, the length of the intestinal tract may increase during periods of hyperphagia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Karasov2">Karasov et al. 1996</xref>), and gut morphology may change in relation to food quality and quantity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Castro1">Castro et al. 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-DeGolier1">DeGolier et al. 1999</xref>). Because the surface and volume of the gut affect assimilation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-SantiagoQuesada1">Santiago-Quesada et al. 2009</xref>), these factors may also have an effect on the size and density of droppings.Finally, extending the Jarman-Bell principle (a lower ratio of metabolic requirement to gut capacity allows larger herbivores to subsist on lower-quality diets compared with smaller herbivores) to the intraspecific level, we expected larger males to have a lower-quality diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Bell1">Bell 1970</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Jarman1">Jarman 1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Demment1">Demment and Van Soest 1985</xref>). Although this prediction has been verified in herbivorous mammals, where males seem to have a simpler, lower-quality diet than females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Staines1">Staines et al. 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Bowyer1">Bowyer 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Bowyer2">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Beier1">Beier 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Ruckstuhl1">Ruckstuhl and Neuhaus 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-PerezBarberia1">P&eacute;rez-Barber&iacute;a et al. 2008</xref>), only a few studies with raptors and fish-eating species have explored sexual divergence in the diets of birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Boal1">Boal and Mannan 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Webster1">Webster 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-GonzalezSolis1">Gonz&aacute;lez-Sol&iacute;s et al. 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Ishikawa1">Ishikawa and Watanuki 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Lee1">Lee and Severinghaus 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Xavier1">Xavier et al. 2006</xref>).

Some trophic niche partitioning between the sexes has been recently suggested in the Greater Prairie-Chicken (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Tympanuchus cupido</named-content></italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-BlancoFontao1">Blanco-Fontao et al. 2013</xref>). However, the relationships between SSD and dietary overlap between males and females are still poorly known in birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Szekely1">Sz&eacute;kely et al. 2007</xref>), and our study aimed to gain some insight into this topic.We conducted our fieldwork in central Spain, where a population of ca. 1,500 Great Bustards has been intensively studied through 2 decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Martin1">Mart&iacute;n et al. 2012</xref>). Here, Great Bustards behave as partial migrants, but the numbers of males and females found in the study area year-round are still high (during the study period, numbers varied from a maximum of 507 males and 1,231 females in the spring of 2007 to a minimum of 235 males and 841 females in the summer of 2007; J. C. Alonso personal observation). Droppings and food availability were sampled in all 9 Great Bustard areas of Madrid province (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-f02">Figure 2</xref>). The areal extents of these 9 Great Bustard areas were calculated by merging 500 m buffers around each bustard location recorded in our censuses of the species in Madrid province in 2004&ndash;2010. The habitat in these areas is mostly dedicated to cereal crop production (&gt;80&percnt; of the land surface is occupied by common wheat &lsqb;<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Triticum aestivum</named-content></italic>&rsqb; and common barley &lsqb;<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Hordeum vulgare</named-content></italic>&rsqb; fields). Some olive (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Olea europaea</named-content></italic>) groves and wine grape (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Vitis vinifera</named-content></italic>) vines have been planted in the remaining area. Occasional sheep grazing occurs in stubble and fallow fields. Cereal is usually grown in a traditional 2-yr rotation; it is sown between October and December, harvested in late June&ndash;early July, and the field is later left fallow for a whole year.Locations of the study areas in central Spain. Nine Great Bustard areas (L1&ndash;L9) were sampled. The perimeters of these areas were drawn as a 500 m buffer around all bustard locations from censuses done in 2004&ndash;2010.The diets of Great Bustards were studied using 619 droppings (299 from females and 320 from males) collected in the 9 Great Bustard areas across 3 seasons: winter (November, 2006&ndash;January, 2007), mating (April, 2007), and postmating (July, 2007). We analyzed the composition of the diet, dietary overlap between the sexes, dietary diversity, diet selection by compositional analysis, and size of arthropod prey species.Fresh droppings were collected at roosting sites at dawn (&gt;75&percnt; of droppings), at midday resting sites after Great Bustards resumed foraging (&gt;20&percnt;), and throughout the day at foraging sites (&lt;5&percnt;). We assumed that droppings collected at roosting and resting sites accounted for the food intake of the previous evening and morning, respectively (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Bautista1">Bautista et al. &lsqb;2013&rsqb;</xref> for collection method details). We also recorded the UTM coordinates of the collection site, the substrate type (stubble, ploughed, legume, sown, fallow, and field border), the date of collection, and sex of the flock. Male and female Great Bustards live in separate single-sex flocks, so droppings from each sex were easily distinguished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Bautista1">Bautista et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Bravo1">Bravo et al. 2014</xref>). Droppings were mostly collected from stubble, ploughed, and cereal fields (&gt;70&percnt; of droppings), with some collected from fallow and legume fields (&lt;20% and &gt;10&percnt;, respectively). All droppings were dried for 48 hr at 60&deg;C and then weighed (accuracy: 0.001 g). The volume of each dropping was measured using a graduated cylinder and glass spheres (1.5 mm diameter). Dry droppings were introduced into a graduated cylinder and covered with glass spheres. The cylinder was shaken until there was no further decrease in total volume. The dropping volume was then calculated as the difference between the total volume and the volume of glass spheres. Dropping density (g per cm<sup>3</sup>) was calculated as dry weight divided by volume.Each dropping was partitioned into green plant material, arthropods, seeds, and fruits, the latter of which were identified through their undigested seeds. These components were weighed separately and the dry weight proportion of each was calculated per dropping. Plant species were identified and quantified by microhistological techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Catan1">Cat&aacute;n et al. 2003</xref>) using our reference collection of tissues from the study area. From each sample, 80 fields were examined with a microscope (40&times;), recording the presence or absence of each plant species. We calculated the percentage of each species in the diet as OD &equals; <italic>n<sub>i</sub></italic> &times; 100 / 80, where <italic>n<sub>i</sub></italic> is the number of microscope fields in which species <italic>i</italic> occurred. We also estimated the percentage of each plant species in the diet as the percentage of dry mass in the droppings. All identified plants and their percentages in the diet are shown in Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-t06">Table 6</xref>. For statistical tests of dry weight percentages and compositional analysis, we grouped plant species into 3 functional groups: cultivated cereals, leguminous species, and weeds.Arthropods were identified to order or family level using our reference collection and published identification keys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Calver1">Calver and Wooller 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Moreby1">Moreby 1988</xref>). We estimated a minimum number of ingested individuals for each arthropod order or family using key body parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Moreby1">Moreby 1988</xref>). In each dropping, recognizable prey remains were measured (e.g., head width, pronotum length, elytra length, and mandible length) with a pair of digital calipers (0.01 mm precision). Length (mm) and dry weight (mg) were estimated for each individual prey item by means of published linear regressions for each taxon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Hodar2">H&oacute;dar 1997</xref>). Average prey body size (mm) was calculated for each dropping. We calculated the percentage of arthropods in the diet as the percentage dry mass of each family or order in the droppings (Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-t07">Table 7</xref>).Seeds and fruits were classified to family or species. We calculated the percentage of seeds and fruits in the diet as the percentage dry mass of each taxon in the droppings (Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-t08">Table 8</xref>). The fruit component of the diet was calculated as the dry weight of whole olives, grapes, and black nightshades (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Solanum nigrum</named-content></italic>), estimated according to the number of their seeds found in the droppings and using dry masses and mean numbers of seeds obtained from samples of these fruits. For dietary diversity and overlap analyses, we used the percentages of all identified plants, arthropods, seeds, and fruits (Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-t06">Tables 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-t07">7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-t08">8</xref>).For diet selection analyses, the availability of plants, arthropods, seeds, and fruits was estimated in the 9 Great Bustard areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-f02">Figure 2</xref>). Within each Great Bustard area, a 400 m buffer around buildings and roads was excluded to obtain the total farmland surface available as foraging substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Torres1">Torres et al. 2011</xref>). Buffers were calculated with ArcGIS 9.3 (ESRI, Redlands, California, USA). In the resulting total buffer area comprising all 9 Great Bustard areas, 3,108 fields were randomly chosen to determine the relative surface of each substrate per Great Bustard area and season. The main substrate types were legumes, sprouted cereals, cereal stubble, ploughed fields, fallow fields, and borders between cultivated fields. In each season, several fields were sampled from each substrate type (range: 14&ndash;33 fields per Great Bustard area and season), totaling 479 fields with availability data for plants, seeds, and arthropods. In winter, 2 samples were taken, one each in November, 2006, and January, 2007, and the results were averaged to get single values for the wintering season. A mating season sample was collected in April, 2007, and a postmating season sample was collected in July, 2007.Plant and seed availabilities (kg ha<sup>&minus;1</sup>) were estimated by randomly throwing a 25 &times; 25 cm metal square 20 times per sampling field, which is adequate to get reliable information about plant composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Ponce2">Ponce et al. 2011</xref>). In each square, plants were identified and sorted into 3 functional groups (cultivated cereals, legumes, and weeds), and their biomasses (kg) were calculated from estimated cover values through allometric equations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Smith2">Smith and Brand 1983</xref>). The mean plant biomass per substrate type was then estimated for each Great Bustard area and season. The total surfaces of the different substrate types varied among Great Bustard areas, and therefore the mean plant biomass (kg) was multiplied by the relative surface area of each substrate type.Seeds were counted and sorted by size into 4 groups (&lt;1 mm; 1&ndash;5 mm; 5&ndash;10 mm; &gt;10 mm) within each sample square. The mean weight of each group was obtained in the laboratory and the total seed biomass availability (kg ha<sup>&minus;1</sup>) was then calculated for each Great Bustard area and season by multiplying the relative surface area of each substrate type by the mean seed biomass in each substrate type and Great Bustard area.Fruit availability (kg ha<sup>&minus;1</sup>) was estimated for olives, grapes, and black nightshades. The mean dry weight of each fruit was calculated in the laboratory (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 20 fruits of each species). The total fruit biomass availability (kg ha<sup>&minus;1</sup>) was then calculated for each Great Bustard area and season. In the case of olives and grapes, the number of fruits was counted on a sample of olive trees and grapevines (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 20) and multiplied by the total number of olive trees and grapevines in the Great Bustard area, which was estimated from aerial photographs using SIGPAC software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sigpac.mapa.es/fega/visor/" xlink:type="simple">http://sigpac.mapa.es/fega/visor/</ext-link>). For black nightshade, the number of <italic>Solanum</italic> plants was estimated by randomly throwing a 25 &times; 25 cm metal square 20 times per field in each substrate and counting nightshade fruits within each sampling square. Mean fruit biomass was estimated for each substrate type per Great Bustard area and multiplied by the relative surface area of each substrate type in the Great Bustard area.Arthropod availability (kg ha<sup>&minus;1</sup>) was estimated in transects (30 m long &times; 1 m wide) by walking slowly and counting and identifying all invertebrates observed to the family level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Lane1">Lane et al. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Ponce1">Ponce et al. 2014</xref>). We collected a random sample of 7,515 arthropods (12&percnt; of the total detected). To estimate arthropod biomass we followed the protocol described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Hodar1">H&oacute;dar (1996)</xref>, in which length&ndash;weight equations are provided for adult arthropods of the Mediterranean region. Maximum body length excluding all appendages (legs, wings, antennae, and ovipositors) was measured for all collected adult arthropods with a pair of digital calipers (0.01 mm precision). Estimates of weights were calculated by means of linear regressions of body weight on body length for each family (order in some cases) for each transect and, subsequently, for each sampled field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Clere1">Clere and Bretagnolle 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Jiguet1">Jiguet 2002</xref>). For each season, mean arthropod biomass was estimated for each substrate type per Great Bustard area and multiplied by the relative surface area of each substrate type in the Great Bustard area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Ponce1">Ponce et al. 2014</xref>).We used the relative availabilities of the main food types, season, and sex as potential predictors of the composition and diversity of Great Bustard diets. Variables that significantly explained diet composition and diversity were selected with linear mixed-effects models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-McCullagh1">McCullagh and Nelder 1989</xref>). We assumed a binomial error distribution and a logit-link function in predictive models of the percentages of legumes, weeds, cultivated cereals, arthropods, seeds, and fruits in droppings (dependent variables). The normal distribution was selected to calculate the Shannon index (<italic>H&prime;</italic>) as a measure of dietary diversity. Sex and season (wintering, mating, and postmating) were defined as independent variables. We included the availability of legumes, weeds, cultivated cereals, arthropods, seeds, and fruits as covariates. As diet composition and food availability may vary among areas, Great Bustard area was included as a random effect in the models. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Zuur1">Zuur et al. (2007)</xref>, we built &lsquo;beyond optimal' models (the most complex models, with all factors and their plausible interactions) with different random error structures using the restricted maximum likelihood estimation procedure. Once the random structure had been defined, we defined the fixed effects structure using the maximum likelihood ratio test. Models were evaluated with Akaike's Information Criterion to determine the best predictive model. A model was defined as the best model when it had the lowest AIC<sub>c</sub> value with a difference (&Delta;AIC<sub>c</sub>) &gt;2 compared with the second-best model. Model-averaging was performed when more than 1 model had &Delta;AIC<sub>c</sub> &lt; 2. To evaluate the amount of variance explained, we calculated the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values of the models using the methods of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Nakagawa1">Nakagawa and Schielzeth (2013)</xref>.

We verified the normal distribution of model residuals by visually checking the normal probability plots and also with a Shapiro-Wilk's test. The homogeneity of variance and goodness-of-fit was checked with plots of residuals vs. fitted values.The diversity of dietary items in the droppings was calculated using the Shannon diversity index: <italic>H'</italic> &equals; &minus;&sum;(<italic>p<sub>i</sub></italic>&middot;ln(<italic>p<sub>i</sub></italic>)), where <italic>p<sub>i</sub></italic> is the proportion of taxon <italic>i</italic> per dropping. We evaluated overlap in the diet between the sexes with the simplified Morisita index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Horn1">Horn 1966</xref>), which ranges from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (complete overlap). This index has relatively low bias and is appropriate for studies in which the selection of resources is reported as a proportion of the total resources used by the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Krebs1">Krebs 1989</xref>). Firstly, we calculated an overlap index for plants, arthropods, seeds (including fruits), and total diet for each season and Great Bustard area using the proportions of identified taxa (family or species level). Secondly, we analyzed seasonal changes in the overlap index using Kruskal-Wallis tests, where the overlap index was the dependent variable and season was a fixed factor. We used the FSA package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Ogle1">Ogle 2013</xref>) in R 2.15.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-RDevelopmentCoreTeam1">R Development Core Team 2012</xref>) to calculate the overlap index.Diet selection was examined using a compositional analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Aebischer1">Aebischer et al. 1993</xref>) in the Excel Macro version Compositional Analysis 6.1 plus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Smith1">Smith 2010</xref>), which examines food use in relation to availability, taking the log-ratio differences of used and available foods. The proportional availabilities of all plants (weeds, cultivated cereals, and legumes), arthropods, seeds, and fruits were compared with their respective proportions in the droppings. Null proportions were replaced with 0.01 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Aebischer1">Aebischer et al. 1993</xref>). The value of <italic>t</italic>, which measures the significance of the deviation in the use of each food category relative to random, was also obtained for each food category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Aebischer1">Aebischer et al. 1993</xref>). This was determined by randomization with 1,000 iterations, as recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Aebischer1">Aebischer et al. (1993)</xref>. The positive log-ratio differences calculated with the compositional analyses were ranked, the most positive log-ratio difference receiving the highest rank as the most preferred food type. From the log-ratios matrix, the sexual effect on rank preference was analyzed with a generalized linear model (GLM), in which the dependent variable was the log-ratios matrix and sex was defined as a fixed factor. This analysis was performed in SPSS 19.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, New York, USA).A total of 1,528 prey items from 179 mating and postmating droppings was measured to explore differences in prey size of male vs. female Great Bustards. Average prey body size was sorted into 5 size categories (&le;10.0, 10.1&ndash;20.0, 20.1&ndash;30.0, 30.1&ndash;40.0, &gt;40.1 mm), and the relative frequency of each size class was calculated for each dropping. Sexual differences were analyzed with a chi-square test. These analyses were carried out in R 2.15.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-RDevelopmentCoreTeam1">R Development Core Team 2012</xref>).Differences in the weight, volume, and density of droppings between the sexes and among seasons were assessed with generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). The weight, volume, and density of droppings could depend on diet composition. Therefore, dry weight percentages of plants, arthropods, seeds, and fruits were included as covariates. Sex and season were defined as fixed effects, and Great Bustard area was defined as a random effect. We utilized a Poisson distribution and a log-link function for the models. GLMMs were run as explained above. Firstly, we compared &lsquo;beyond optimal' models with different random error structures. Once the random structure had been defined, we defined the fixed effects structure using maximum likelihood. Models were ranked with Akaike's Information Criterion to determine the best predictive model. Marginal <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> and conditional <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> were also calculated as explained above. Normal distribution was checked as explained above. All GLMMs were run in R 2.15.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-RDevelopmentCoreTeam1">R Development Core Team 2012</xref>).The dry weight fractions of the whole sample of droppings (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 619) were 79.6 &plusmn; 29.5&percnt; green plant material, 9.8 &plusmn; 23.0&percnt; arthropods, 6.5 &plusmn; 18.2&percnt; fruits, and 4.1 &plusmn; 11.0&percnt; seeds (mean &plusmn; SD). Up to 67 green plant species were identified, although most of these plants were recorded only occasionally (Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-t06">Table 6</xref>). The most frequently recorded functional groups were weeds (45.9 &plusmn; 31.1&percnt; SD dry weight) and legumes (25.1 &plusmn; 28.1&percnt; SD dry weight; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-f03">Figure 3</xref>). The best models included season and sex as significant factors influencing the percentages of the 6 food types considered (legumes, weeds, cultivated cereal plants, arthropods, seeds, and fruits; <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-t01">Table 1</xref>, Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-t09">Table 9</xref>). The best model for legume consumption also included legume availability (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-t01">Table 1</xref>).

The lowest overlap value was found during the postmating season (0.65 &plusmn; 0.06; <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-t03">Table 3</xref>). Splitting the sample by food classes, the overlap index between males and females did not show significant seasonal changes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-t03">Table 3</xref>). The highest overlap index for a single food class was that of plants in the mating season (0.84 &plusmn; 0.22).There was a significant effect of season on diet selection, and this effect differed between the sexes. Great Bustards preferentially selected legumes in the wintering and mating seasons, but not in the postmating season, when arthropods were the most preferred food (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-t04">Table 4</xref>). There were significant sexual differences in food selection values in the wintering and postmating seasons, but not in the mating season (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-t04">Table 4</xref>). In winter, males selected weeds and legumes equally, preferring these foods to cereals and seeds, whereas females significantly preferred legumes to seeds. During the mating season, both sexes preferentially selected legumes, but females selected weeds and seeds equally, while males significantly selected weeds over seeds. Finally, both sexes selected arthropods during the postmating season, but females preferred fruit as a second food type, whereas males preferred weeds (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-t04">Table 4</xref>). In summary, females showed a more marked preference than males for legumes in winter.Compositional analysis matrix based on the comparison between available food types and those used by Great Bustards in central Spain.Average prey length was 13.1 &plusmn; 10.1 mm (range: 2&ndash;83 mm). Splitting prey length by taxon, Acrididae and Meloidae were the largest prey, at 32.9 &plusmn; 7.0 mm (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 39) and 31.3 &plusmn; 7.2 mm (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 85), respectively, and Chrysomelidae and Cerambycidae were the smallest, at 6.9 &plusmn; 1.2 mm (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 86) and 7.4 &plusmn; 3.0 mm (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 11), respectively. There were significant differences in the length of prey eaten by male and female Great Bustards (&chi;<sup>2</sup> &equals; 9.82, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.04), with males consuming larger individuals than females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-f05">Figure 5</xref>).

White bars &equals; females; black bars &equals; males.The weight, volume, and density of droppings varied between the sexes, among seasons, and by dropping composition (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-t05">Table 5</xref>). The droppings of males were significantly heavier and more voluminous (3.6 &plusmn; 3.1 g and 7.5 &plusmn; 5.4 cm<sup>3</sup>) than the droppings of females (1.5 &plusmn; 1.2 g and 3.5 &plusmn; 2.9 cm<sup>3</sup>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-t05">Table 5</xref>). The weight of droppings also depended upon diet composition, increasing with the percentage of fruit ingested (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-t05">Table 5</xref>). The 3 best models for dropping volume showed similar AIC<sub>c</sub> values (Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-t11">Table 11</xref>). Model-averaging resulted in a GLMM that included sex and season as significant factors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-t05">Table 5</xref>). The volume of droppings did not depend significantly on dropping composition (percentage of plants, arthropod, seeds, and fruits; <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-t05">Table 5</xref>).Final generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) for the weight, volume, and density of Great Bustard droppings in central Spain.The average density of droppings was 0.54 &plusmn; 0.49 g per cm<sup>3</sup> (females: 0.49 &plusmn; 0.26 g per cm<sup>3</sup>; males: 0.58 &plusmn; 0.63 g per cm<sup>3</sup>). Model selection for the density of droppings resulted in 4 models with &Delta;AIC<sub>c</sub> &lt; 2 (Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-t11">Table 11</xref>). Model-averaging of the top models resulted in a GLMM that included sex and season as significant factors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-t05">Table 5</xref>). Dropping density was significantly higher for males than for females in the postmating season (0.17 &plusmn; 0.05, estimate &plusmn; SE; <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-t05">Table 5</xref>).As expected, our best models included sex as a main factor explaining differences in the diet composition and diversity of Great Bustards throughout the annual cycle. Males and females shared a similar dietary spectrum, but consumed some of the available food resources in different proportions, and males showed higher dietary diversity than females, except during the postmating season.The proportions of green plants, arthropods, seeds, and fruits in the diets of both sexes varied seasonally in relation to the availability of these elements. Being omnivorous, Great Bustards behaved as opportunistic foragers and showed ecological plasticity in their feeding behaviors. Similar seasonal changes in the Great Bustard diet have been reported in other areas of Spain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Lucio1">Lucio 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Lane1">Lane et al. 1999</xref>) and in Portugal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Rocha1">Rocha et al. 2005</xref>). In spite of their relatively opportunistic and generalist foraging habits (note that their diet includes 103 species), Great Bustards have a clear preference for a few digestible and nutritious plants, with 5 species contributing ~40&percnt; to their year-round diet. These most-consumed species were <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Convolvulus arvensis</named-content></italic>, <italic>Anacyclus clavatus</italic>, <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Papaver rhoeas</named-content></italic>, <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Raphanus raphanistrum</named-content></italic>, and <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Vicia sativa</named-content></italic> (Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-t01">Table 1</xref>), showing the importance of weeds and legumes in the bustards' diet. The prevalent consumption of weeds and the strong selection of legumes are surely important for supporting the high food requirements of large-bodied birds such as Great Bustards. Weeds are generally abundant in their habitat and legumes are one of the best protein sources among green plants. Despite the observed seasonal variation in diet, green plants were so prevalent that Great Bustards could be described as mainly herbivorous. Females were more selective than males, with higher legume consumption and, consequently, lower dietary diversity values. They followed a primary prediction of optimal foraging theory, which proposes that when the preferred resource is abundant, foragers concentrate on this resource and have narrow food niches. As the preferred resource becomes scarce, lower-quality resources are added to the diet and individuals become more opportunistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-MacArthur1">MacArthur and Pianka 1966</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Araujo1">Ara&uacute;jo et al. 2008</xref>). In contrast to females, the dietary diversity of males did not decrease with increasing legume availability, in accordance with their lower preference for legumes and their less selective diet. Our compositional analysis corroborated the higher selection of legumes by females, particularly during winter (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-t04">Table 4</xref>).A less specialized diet when alternative highly nutritious resources are available seems paradoxical, but it could be a consequence of sexual dimorphism. For example, in Red Knots (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Calidris canutus</named-content></italic>), individuals with smaller gizzards selected higher-quality prey rather than larger prey, due to digestive constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-vanGils3">van Gils et al. 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-vanGils2">2005b</xref>). The larger sex could meet its nutritional needs by feeding on a wide range of prey items due to its bigger body and gut size, but the smaller sex had to exploit the opportunity provided by the abundance of the most nutritious resource. Our results agree with those of studies of sexually dimorphic herbivorous mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Demment1">Demment and Van Soest 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Bowyer2">Bowyer 2004</xref>), where larger-bodied individuals were found to be less selective than smaller-bodied individuals.Because females showed a greater proportion of legumes in their diet and lower dietary diversity than males, the dietary overlap between the sexes was relatively low in all seasons. Although males and females fed on the same spectrum of available food items, their dietary overlap was ca. 0.73, one of the smallest overlap values among birds (C. Bravo personal observation). The highest dietary overlap was in the plants component of the diet and was observed in the mating season (0.84), when both sexes met at leks and considerably reduced their spatial segregation. In contrast, their dietary overlap was lowest during the postmating season, when females carry out chick rearing alone and males usually abandon the leks to recover from their high investment in mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Alonso3">Alonso et al. 2009b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Palacin1">Palac&iacute;n et al. 2009</xref>). This suggests that sexual differences in the diet are not only direct consequences of the bustards' SSD, but also mediated by the distinct reproductive roles of males and females, which may be another cause of dietary divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Fairbairn1">Fairbairn 1997</xref>). A similar pattern of seasonal diet partitioning between the sexes as a consequence of their different reproductive roles has been reported for Greater Prairie-Chickens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-BlancoFontao1">Blanco-Fontao et al. 2013</xref>). In addition, females consumed more arthropods and seeds than males, particularly during the postmating season. Arthropods and seeds are rich in crude protein, calcium, and phosphorus, and probably help females to restore their calcium levels after the egg-laying period. This result also suggests the importance of the reproductive role as a cause of the dietary divergence between the sexes.Males consumed fewer arthropods, but of significantly larger size, than females. These sexual differences in the average size of prey eaten were also found in young Great Bustards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Bravo2">Bravo et al. 2012</xref>) and in Australian Bustards (<italic>Ardeotis australis</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Ziembicki1">Ziembicki 2010</xref>). In addition, flying or highly mobile arthropods such as grasshoppers were more frequent in the female than in the male diet (Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-t07">Table 7</xref>), suggesting that females, being smaller and thus more agile than males, have a higher ability to capture mobile prey. Additionally, the female role as food provider to offspring could determine the selection of specific arthropods, as well as the most effective prey size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Andersson1">Andersson 1994</xref>). These differences likely contribute to reducing intersexual competition for food resources in size-dimorphic species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Selander1">Selander 1966</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Shine1">Shine 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Fairbairn1">Fairbairn 1997</xref>).The feces of males were 2.4 times heavier than the feces of females, as expected from sexual differences in body weight (males are ~2.4 times heavier than females; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Alonso1">Alonso et al. 2009a</xref>). The sexual difference in average dropping weight could represent a proxy for the sexual difference in food intake, assuming a similar defecation rate for both sexes. Defecation rate currently cannot be sampled for Great Bustards, as they defecate mainly in roosts at night and at resting sites at midday (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Bautista1">Bautista et al. 2013</xref>). A similar defecation rate could be assumed following published studies of avian herbivory in which a sex effect in defecation rate has not been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-vanGils1">van Gils and Tijsen 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-vanGils4">van Gils et al. 2007</xref>). It is noteworthy that the size and density of Great Bustard droppings changed among seasons. This seasonal change in dropping size could be related to a seasonal change in gut morphology determined by food quality and quantity, as shown for other bird species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Leopold1">Leopold 1953</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Pendergast1">Pendergast and Boag 1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Geluso1">Geluso and Hayes 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-133-2-178-Williamson1">Williamson et al. 2014</xref>). A sexual difference in dropping density is compatible with a sexual difference in digestive ability, and it would be worth investigating whether such a sexual difference does exist. Our results should be confirmed with further research on sexual differences in gut performance, gut allometry, and digestive efficiency in Great Bustards.In summary, the results of this study confirm that the diets of adult male and adult female Great Bustards are different. The divergent nutritional and energetic requirements of males and females and their sexual differences in diet and foraging behavior could be explained in part by sexual segregation as a primary proximate factor. Sexual segregation may in turn be a consequence of the distinct reproductive roles and the extreme SSD of both sexes, both of which are ultimately determined by the strong sexual selection operating in this species. Sexual differences in microhabitat selection should be further investigated in this species to confirm these hypotheses and to establish the most plausible causal relationships.We thank A.
