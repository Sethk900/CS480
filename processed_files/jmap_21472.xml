Descriptions of a new Brazilian Tacora species and the female of Tacora saturata, and a key to the species of the genus (Insecta, Hemiptera, Cicadellidae, Cicadellini)Abstract Tacora johanni, a new species from Rond√¥nia State, North Brazil, is described and illustrated. The new species can be recognized by the male genital features, especially the subgenital plates with the basal half distinctly expanded and with outer lateral margin round, the long and slender preapical pygofer process, and the styles with apical half strongly curved. Also, the genus is recorded for the first time from Venezuela, based on specimens of Tacora saturata Young, 1977, while the female of this species (here described in detail for the first time) shows two unusual features of the genitalia. A key to males of all known Tacora species and a map showing the known distribution of the genus are provided.
