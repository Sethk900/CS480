Evaluation of a GIS-Based Watershed Model for Streamflow and Sediment-Yield Simulation in the Upper Baitarani River Basin of Eastern IndiaAbstractWatershed models supported by a geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing data have proven to be vital research tools for the planning and management of land and water resources at watershed or river basin scales. The present study was undertaken with the objective of evaluating a watershed model for the simulation of streamflow and sediment yield in the Baitarani watershed of Eastern India. The watershed model was calibrated and validated using daily rainfall and streamflow data from 1998 to 2005 and sediment yield data from 2002 to 2005. Other input parameters of the watershed model such as digital elevation model, soil map, and land use/land cover map were generated using GIS. The performance of the model was evaluated using salient statistical and graphical indicators. The model calibration and validation results revealed that the watershed model simulated streamflow in the study watershed with a higher level of accuracy at daily [Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) = 0.86 and 0.84] and monthly (NSE=0.95 and 0.93) time steps during both calibration and validation periods. However, the model simulated sediment yields more accurately at the monthly time step (NSE=0.91 and 0.90) than the daily time step (NSE=0.62 and 0.59). During the entire period of sediment simulation (2002–2005), the total model-simulated sediment yield was 1,771×103  tons against the observed sediment yield of 1,799×103  tons with a deviation of approximately 1.6%. It is concluded that the watershed model is suitable for the simulation of streamflow and sediment transport in the study area, and it also has potential for adoption in other watersheds of the Baitarani River Basin as well as in other watersheds of India.
