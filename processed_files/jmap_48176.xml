Can vegetation corridors provide habitat in fragmented landscapes? A case-study in the Brazilian Atlantic DomainThis is the first study evaluating the vegetation corridor as habitat in Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We used the marsupial Marmosops incanus, a forest specialist, as a model. Our main question was: does the vegetation corridor provide habitat for populations of this species? We found that the corridor harbored males and females in the same proportion and equally distributed by age classes. Body weights of males and females captured in the corridor did not differ from those of individuals in the forest fragments. Our results showed that the corridor acts as a suitable habitat for M. incanus. Thus, this study highlights the importance of conserving vegetation corridors.
