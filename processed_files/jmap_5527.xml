Polymorphism in the deutonymph and adult of Sennertia alfkeni (Acari: Chaetodactylidae) associated with the large carpenter bee, Xylocopa appendiculata circumvolans (Hymenoptera: Apidae)Phoretic deutonymphs of Sennertia alfkeni and S. japonica, both associated with the Japanese large carpenter bee, Xylocopa appendiculata, were distinguished by Fain (1974) by body size and the presence or absence of a spine proximal to the pretarsal claw. Despite these morphological differences, rearing of isoâ€female lines yielded both morphological forms, thus revealing that both were the same species but functionally different during phoresy. Adults also expressed variation in the form of the dorsal setae, ranging from narrow to broad. We hypothesized that deutonymphal morphology was controlled environmentally, but that the adult setal morphology was at least partially controlled genetically. Both types of deutonymphs disembarked from a female bee during the host tunnelling through provisioning of nests in spring, but there seemed to be no behavioural difference between the two morphs at the time of disembarkation.
