Diagnosis of the record discharge of Arctic-draining Eurasian rivers in 2007Aggregate annual discharge from the six largest Arctic-draining Eurasian rivers achieved an all-time record high in 2007, accentuating a long-term upward trend that argues for intensification of the Arctic hydrologic cycle. This record discharge was due in part to strong positive anomalies in late winter snow water equivalent across much of northern Eurasia. These anomalies arose in response to an unusual pattern of atmospheric circulation in late 2006 and early 2007, characterized by an extreme northeastward extension of the Icelandic Low and a contraction of the Siberian High. Positive net precipitation anomalies then continued into summer, further contributing to discharge.
