Crop yield predictions based on  properties of soils in Sevilla, Spain. Geoderma, 25: 267--274.    An approach is described for estimating yields of wheat, field corn (maize) and cotton  on the basis of selected properties of soils when used under a high level of management.  Statistical models were calibrated against the properties of the soils and the estimated  yields of the three crops on 25 soils representing five great groups. The procedure con-  sisted of computing algebraic equations following analyses by multiple regression. Soil  properties selected were: useful depth, clay content, depth to hydromorphic features,  carbonate content, salinity, sodium saturation and cation exchange capacity. The selected  properties accounted for 78 to 84% in the general model and for 56 to 80% in the qua-  dratic model of the variations in yields of the three crops. Estimates were also made of  the optimum expressions of two properties, useful depth and depth to hydromorphic  features, to maximize yields of the crops.    INTRODUCTION    Productive capacity or expectable yields are useful in determining the  suitability of any soil for agricultural use. Consequently, estimates have been  made of the productivity of individual kinds of soils in many places. Attempts  have been made to key the yields of crops or pasture to limited numbers of  soil properties (Storie, 1950; Carstea, 1964; Sys, 1964; De la Rosa et al., 1977).  Other approaches have relied on crop yields from identified soils in farm  fields (Simonson, 1938; OdeU, 1958}. With available computer techniques for  storing and retrieving information, it should be possible, as suggested by Cline  (1977), to prepare both more and better estimates of expectable yields ;"rom  soils.  This paper describes an approach for predicting yields of wheat, corn and  cotton on the basis of selected soil properties. In this approach, statistical  models were first designed to relate the yields of three crops to selected proper.  ties of 25 soils of Sevilla. Correlations and multiple regression analyses were  employed to investigate the relative contributions of the selected soil proper-    0016-7061/81/0000--0000l$02.50 1981 Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company    268    ties. Similar techniques were also applied to estimate optimum expressions of  two properties, useful depth and depth to hydromorphic features, for maxi-  mum yields of the three crops.    MATERIALS AND METHODS    Twenty-five cultivated soils were studied. All of these soils are in a bench-  mark zone, 35,000 ha in extent, located on the lower section of the Guadal-  quivir Valley in the Province of Sevilla (Fig. 1) (a benchmark zone is a represen-  tative area, where detailed investigations are made whose res'flts are trans-  ferred to other similar areas). This zone has the general char tcteristics of a  Mediterranean climate, where winters are moist and cool an:( summers are  warm and dry. During the 1968--74 period, major climatic factors were: total  annual rainfall, 600 mm; mean annual temperature, 17.1; maximum month-  ly temperature, 23.5C; minimum monthly temperature, 10.3.    '  .....  J  ii ""'(    Fig. 1. Location of the study zone in Spain.    The individual soils studied constituted entire fields. In sampling the soils,  a single site was chosen to represent each of the 25 kinds. The soil characteri-  zation was made during a soil survey of the benchmark zone (Centro de  Edafologfa y Biologfa Aplicada del Cuarto, 1976). The 25 soils were classi-  fied in the following great groups: Haploxeralfs (3), Rhodoxeralfs (3), Xero-  fluvents (7), Xeroch','epts (3), and Chromoxererts (9), as described in "Soil  Taxonomy" (Soil Survey Staff, 1975).  Useful depth was considered to be the total thickness of the soil profile  providing a favorable environment for growth of roots. For the soils studied,  the lower limits of useful depth were an impervious argillic material (Bt horizon),    269    a petrocalcic horizon (Cca) or a gravel layer. Depth to hydromorphic features  was established as the depth between the soil surface and the horizon with  many black iron-manganese nodules (De la Rosa et al., 1977).  Clay content was determined by the hydrometer method (Bouyoucos,  1962). Carbonate content was measured by a volumetric method. Salinity  was determined by the conductivity of a saturation extract. Sodium satura-  tion (exchangeable-sodium percentage) was calculated by dividing exchangeable  sodium by cation exchange capacity. Cation exchange capacity was measured  by the NH4Ac at pH 7.0 -- leaching tube method. Exchangeable sodium was  measured by flame photometry on the leachate (Soil Survey Staff, 1972).  A control section of the soil profile was selected for taking soil samples for  chemical determinations. It was established as a vertical section between 25  and 50 cm, between 25 and the limit of useful depth when this limit was be-  tween 25 and 50 cm or in any part above the limit of useful depth if this  depth was less than 25 cm. Duplicate samples were taken to represent the  control section of each soil profile, and duplicate chemical measurements  were also made.  Information on yields of wheat (Triticum aestivum L., cv. Mexipal), field  corn (Zea mays L., cv. Pioneer 309) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L., cv.  Coker Carolina Queen) for the soils investigated was provided by farmers, soil  scientists and agronomists. Estimated average yields were based on actual  records so as to correspond to production obtained in recent years under a  high level of management. In the benchmark zone, the high level of manage-  ment included the following practices: rainfall is conserved effectively; a  surface drainage system is installed when needed; suitable quality and quantity  of irrigation water are used; irrigation is timed to meet the needs of the soil  and crop; irrigation is by furrows; tillage is timely; insect, disease and weed  control measures are used consistently; fertilizers (N, P2Os, K20) are applied  according to soil tests and crop needs; adapted crop varieties are used at  recommended seeding rates; and crops included in the rotations are normally  wheat, corn, cotton, sugar beets and potatoes.  The crop yield or response Y was analysed as a function of the type:  Y=xl, x2 ...,Xn)+e  where e measures the resi,4ual. As the mathematical form of is not known,  this function can be approximated satisfactorily, within the experimental  region, by a polynomial (Cochran and Cox, 1962). Thus for each crop, the  following general polynomial model was used:  ? = bo + ~  biXi +   ~   bijXiXj  l ~i~n           l &lt;i&lt;j~n    where I~ represents the predicted yield, and b-values are the intercept term  and partial coefficients for the independent variables: useful depth (X1), clay  content (X2), depth to hydromorphic features (X3), carbonate content (X4),    270    salinity (Xs), sodium saturation (X6) and cation exchange capacity (XT), and  their interactions of second order. Squared terms were not included in the  general model for reasons of simplicity.  Quadratic polynomials were also fitted. Their general form was:  ~r = bo + blXi + b2Xj + baXi2 + b4Xi2 + bsXiX1  These were limited to the two factors (useful depth and depth to hydromorphic  features) which had the highest influence on the crop yields as shown in the  correlation analysis.  The calibration of these polynomial models was treated statistically as a  particular case of multiple regression. Correlation and multiple regression  analyses were performed using the Biomedical Computer Programs, BMDP  (Dixon, 1975) on an UNIVAC 1108 computer at the Centro de C~lculo, Uni-  versidad de Seville, Spain.  On the basis of the quadratic models, a mathematical procedure was fol-  lowed in order to find a combination of X-variables to maximize predicted yields.  This procedure was: by taking the first derivative with respect to each indepen-  dent variable, setting it equal to zero and then solving a system of simultaneous  equations.    RESULTS AND DISCUSSION    Ranges and mean values of useful depth, clay content, depth to hydro-  morphic features, carbonate content, salinity, sodium saturation, cation ex-  change capacity, wheat yield, corn yield and cotton yield for the 25 soils in-  vestigated are reported in Table I. For each soil property, the scatter of the  data was quite wide. Coefficient~ of variation (+ 1 o 100/M) ranged from  34 to 171%.

Their coefficients of variation ranged between 23 and 31%.  Simple correlation coefficients (r) between the paired soil factors were  calculated and these are shown in matrix form in Table II. Correlation of  wheat, corn and cotton yields with X-variables gave similar ranges of r-values.  The influence of useful depth and depth to hydromorphic features, as indi-  cated by highest r-values, are the most important for yields of the three crops.  Clay content in all cases was, however, slightly correlated (0.03 ~&lt; r &lt; 0.19)  with the Y-variable. Among X-variables, useful depth with depth to hydro-  morphic features, and clay content with salinity and cation exchange capacity  showed the highest coefficients of correlation (r=0.67"*, 0.66**, and 0.73**,  respectively). The correlation data provided a convenient starting point in  estimating the cont;ribution of the X-variables to the explanation of crop  yields.

In the multiple regression analysis (Table III), the general model type was  selected after taking into account the main effects of the X-variables that were  considered and the major interactions of second order. This approach was  chosen for reasons of simplicity. For wheat yields, the numerical computa-  tion method showed that the variations observed were best accounted for  (R~ = 0.78) by the equation reported in Table III. Note further the lack of  significance of the clay content--wheat yield relationship. For corn yields,  the coefficient of multiple determination (R%value) showed that the equa-  tion reported in Table III accounted for 78% of the observed variation.  Although simple correlation ar.alysis showed that c .arbonate contents were  significantly correlated with corn yields (Table II), multiple regression anal-    272    TABLE III  Results of fitting of the polynomial models by multiple regression analysis    Crop       Polynomial equation* ~                                       R~    Wheat  Corn    Cotton    General models  Y1 = -1,740.3 + 52.1Xt + 33.0X3 +27.2X+ +238.0Xs         0.78  -0.4XIX+ -6.2XsX~ + 11.0X6X~  Y2 = 1,085.4 + 30.OX~ +28.0Xs-418.1X6 + 17.0X2Xs         0.78  0.2X2X7 -39.2XsX~ + 21.0X+X7  Ys = 1,266.3 -1.4X1-9.2X2 + 12.1X3 -90.3Xs                0.84  +49.0X~ -0.4X2X7 +11.0X6X~    Quadratic models  Wheat      Yl = 699-0-21.0XI +59.1X3 +0.4XI2-0.2X~2                0.73  -0.2X1X"  Corn       Y2 = -2,720.6 + 29.4X1 156.8X3-0.6X~2 -1.1X~2           0.80  +0.SXiX,  Cotton     Ys = 88.5 +32.4X~ +34.4X3 -0.6X~2 -0.SXs2                 0.56  +I.IX~Xs    1 Yi = wheat yield, Y2 = corn yield, Y3 = cotton yield, X1 = useful depth, X~ = clay  content, X~ = depth to hydromorphic features, X+ = carbonate content, Xs = salinity,  X6 = sodium saturation, and X~ = cation exchange capacity.    ysis showed that this X-variable had no important effect. For cotton yields,  the R: -value showed that the equation reported in Table III accounted for  84% of the observed variation. In this case multiple regression analysis was  made with clay content in the model although its correlation with cotton  yield was very low (Table II). The significance of the partial mean squares  for the independent variables against deviation from regression mean square  was tested (Table IV). The F-values for useful depth (F1) were significant  (1 or 5% level) except for the cotton model. The F-values for depth to hydro-  morphic features (F: in wheat and corn equations and F3 in the cotton  model) were also significant (1 or 5% level). The interactions of sodium satura-  tion with cation exchange capacity and of salinity with cation exchange  capacity presented F-values significant (1 or 5% level) in the wheat and cotton  models (FT) and the corn model (F~).

AbstractAn approach is described for estimating yields of wheat, field corn (maize) and cotton on the basis of selected properties of soils when used under a high level of management. Statistical models were calibrated against the properties of the soils and the estimated yields of the three crops on 25 soils representing five great groups. The procedure consisted of computing algebraic equations following analyses by multiple regression. Soil properties selected were: useful depth, clay content, depth to hydromorphic features, carbonate content, salinity, sodium saturation and cation exchange capacity. The selected properties accounted for 78 to 84% in the general model and for 56 to 80% in the quadratic model of the variations in yields of the three crops. Estimates were also made of the optimum expressions of two properties, useful depth and depth to hydromorphic features, to maximize yields of the crops.
