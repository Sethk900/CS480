Evaluation of phosphorus sorption by an allophanic soilSolutions containing different P concentrations were equilibrated with samples of an allophanic soil from Navarra (Spain) to determine whether P sorption conformed qualitatively and quantitatively to the Langmuir, Freundlich and Sokolowska isotherms. Phosphorus sorption conformed to the Langmuir isotherm. When the sorption d data were plotted according to the conventional and Hofstee forms, two linear relationships were obtained. At the lower equilibrium P concentrations the K1 parameter determined by regression analysis was higher than those corresponding to higher equilibrium P concentrations. The values obtained for K1 and K2 by the conventional and Hofstee equations were different. A procedure for evaluating the coefficients for higher equilibrium P concentrations was proposed. The K1 and K2 values so obtained allowed us to generate an experimental curve by addition of calculated adsorption data. This suggests that the curve-splitting technique is satisfactory. The sorption data also conformed to the Freundlich and Sokolowska equations, but in the latter it was necessary to evaluate two different sets of parameters. The same experimental data can be adjusted to the three different equations, in one case with only one set of constants and in the other two cases with two different sets of parameters, one for the lower P concentrations and the other for the higher ones. Besides, to fit the experimental data to the Langmuir and Sokolowska equations, it was necessary to split the isotherm into two regions and these two regions were different for the Langmuir and the Sokolowska equations. This suggests that the parameters do not have any chemical signification and that they are only â€œcurve fittingâ€. A study of the effect of pH on the P sorption indicated that low pH notably increased the P sorption. The soil samples had very high phosphate sorption capacity probably due to the very large specific surface and reactivity of the allophane.
