Consensus higher-level molecular phylogenies support a basal split between the unicellular Cyanidiophytina and morphologically diverse Rhodophytina, the later subphylum containing most red algal species. The Rhodophytina is divided into six classes, of which five represent early diverging lineages of generally uninucleate species, whose evolutionary relationships are poorly resolved. The remaining species compose the large (27 currently recognized orders), morphologically diverse and typically multinucleate Florideophyceae. Nuclear DNA content estimates have been published for &lt;1 % of the described red algae. The present investigation summarizes the state of our knowledge and expands our coverage of DNA content information from 196 isolates of red algae.The DNA-localizing fluorochrome DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) and RBC (chicken erythrocytes) standards were used to estimate 2C values with static microspectrophotometry.Nuclear DNA contents are reported for 196 isolates of red algae, almost doubling the number of estimates available for these organisms. Present results also confirm the reported DNA content range of 0.1–2.8 pg, with species of Ceramiales, Nemaliales and Palmariales containing apparently polyploid genomes with 2C = 2.8, 2.3 and 2.8 pg, respectively.Early diverging red algal lineages are characterized by relatively small 2C DNA contents while a wide range of 2C values is found within the derived Florideophyceae. An overall correlation between phylogenetic placement and 2C DNA content is not apparent; however, genome size data are available for only a small portion of red algae. Current data do support polyploidy and aneuploidy as pervasive features of red algal genome evolution.The Second Plant Genome Size Workshop and Discussion Meeting (hosted by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, 8–12 September 2003) identified major gaps (systematic, regional and plant type) in our knowledge of plant DNA amounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C6">Bennett and Leitch 2005<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C7"><italic>b</italic></xref>). It was noted that no database was available for algae. This major gap was addressed with a compilation of genome size estimates for 247 species of macroscopic marine algae, including data for 95 isolates and species of red algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C71">Kapraun 2005</xref>). These data have been incorporated into a database of plant genome sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C85">Kapraun <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>) compiled and hosted by the Royal Botanic Gardens (RBG) Kew web page (<uri xlink:href="http://data.kew.org/cvalues/" xlink:type="simple">http://data.kew.org/cvalues/</uri>). A subsequent investigation of green algae resulted in an expansion of coverage and characterization of the ancestral land plant flagellate genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C72">Kapraun 2007</xref>). More recently, efforts to expand coverage of DNA contents in brown algae were published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C120">Phillips <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). This final report in the series summarizes nuclear DNA content data for red algae, both from our continuing investigations and from the literature. Results are updated at <uri xlink:href="http://people.uncw.edu/kapraund/DNA" xlink:type="simple">http://people.uncw.edu/kapraund/DNA</uri> (see links to ‘Rhodophyta’). The present paper provides nuclear genome size estimates for 77 additional isolates of red algae and compiles all available data (196 species/isolates) into a single resource [see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/pls005/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Additional Information</ext-link>]. Of this new list, 40 resulted from our ongoing research. Unicellular microalgae and freshwater red algae, which were previously under-represented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C71">Kapraun 2005</xref>), are emphasized here.Inclusion of published nuclear DNA content data for red algae in the present report was sometimes problematic. The Second Plant Genome Size Workshop and Discussion Meeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C7">Bennett and Leitch 2005<italic>b</italic></xref>) identified ‘best practice’ methodology for nuclear genome size estimation in plant tissues. Virtually none of the published genome size data for algae resulted from investigations adhering to all of the best practice recommendations, primarily because measurement of the relatively small algal nuclear genomes requires standard species different from those specified as appropriate for vascular plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C35">Doležel <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C71">Kapraun 2005</xref>). A comprehensive discussion on standard species and methods is included in the section ‘Notes on Appendix I’.The red algae (Rhodophyta) are predominantly marine organisms with &gt;700 genera and 6000 species described in 38 orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C56">Guiry and Guiry 2011</xref>). The Rhodophyta are characterized by unstacked thylakoids in plastids, plastids containing the accessory pigments phycoerythrin, phycocyanin and allophycocyanin arranged in phycobilisomes, the lack of plastid endoplasmic reticulum, the presence of pit connections between cells in filamentous genera and the absence of flagellated cells in the life history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C159">Woelkerling 1990</xref>). There are a variety of current higher-level classification schemes for red algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C129">Saunders and Hommersand 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C166">Yoon <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C56">Guiry and Guiry 2011</xref>).

The remaining Rhodophyta are divided into six classes that are grouped as a single subphyllum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C166">Yoon <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>) or multiple subphyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C129">Saunders and Hommersand 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C56">Guiry and Guiry 2011</xref>). Five of these classes, Porphyridiophyceae, Stylonematophyceae, Compsopogonophyceae, Rhodellophyceae and Bangiophyceae, are early diverging lineages of generally uninucleate species, whose evolutionary relationships are poorly resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C166">Yoon <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C151">Verbruggen <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). These five classes represent about 1 % of the total number of described red algal species. The remaining species are typically multinucleate and classified within the Florideophyceae, a large class of 27 currently recognized orders falling within five subclasses represented by clades that terminate long, basally positioned branches in molecular phylogenies with specific synapomorphic pit plug characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C128">Saunders and Bailey 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C92">Le Gall and Saunders 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C151">Verbruggen <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>).The traditional view that the Acrochaetiales are the most primitive and the Ceramiales are the most highly derived of the florideophycidean red algal orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C91">Kylin 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C34">Dixon 1973</xref>) is not supported by molecular data (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C92">Le Gall and Saunders 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C151">Verbruggen <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). A more complex phylogenetic model is emerging for red algae, characterized by ancient lineages often terminating in modern radiations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C166">Yoon <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C92">Le Gall and Saunders 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C151">Verbruggen <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>).New availability of both a DNA C-values database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C85">Kapraun <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>) and consensus higher-level phylogenies has opened the way for determining evolutionary trends in DNA amounts for other red algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C71">Kapraun 2005</xref>). The present static microspectrophotometric investigation of additional species of red algae was initiated to determine the extent of nuclear DNA content variation, to identify any correlation between genome size and phylogenetic relationships, and to corroborate an alternation of haploid and diploid nuclear DNA contents in gametophyte and sporophyte tissue, respectively, of selected species.Species collection data and/or source of cultures for newly reported data are summarized at <uri xlink:href="http://people.uncw.edu/kapraund/DNA" xlink:type="simple">http://people.uncw.edu/kapraund/DNA</uri> (see links to ‘Rhodophyta’).

Algal specimens were transferred to coverslips treated with subbing solution, and then air dried and stained with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (0.5 μg mL<sup>−1</sup>) (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO, USA) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C46">Goff and Coleman 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C47">1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C48">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C78">Kapraun and Nguyen 1994</xref>).

Chicken has a nuclear DNA base composition of 42–43 mol% G + C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C98">Marmur and Doty 1962</xref>).

It is assumed that these recent values are more accurate. Consequently, earlier nuclear genome size estimates listed here should be treated with caution.These classes were traditionally included with the Bangiophyceae in a group variously classified as a subphylum or subclass. Early molecular studies indicated that this was a polyphyletic grouping of distinct lineages (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C43">Freshwater <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C104">Müller <italic>et al.</italic> 2001<italic>b</italic></xref>), and recent studies have assigned these lineages to separate classes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C129">Saunders and Hommersand 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C166">Yoon <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). The Porphyridiophyceae consists solely of unicellular forms including <italic>Porphyridium</italic> and <italic>Flintiella</italic>, while unicellular and pseudofilamentous taxa such as <italic>Rhodosorus</italic>, <italic>Stylonema</italic> and <italic>Goniotrichopsis</italic> make up the Stylonematophyceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C157">West <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C166">Yoon <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). The Compsopogonophyceae includes taxa of various morphologies that have been treated as separate families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C125">Rintoul <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>) or orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C143">Silva <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>), but which form a monophyletic lineage in most analyses (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C166">Yoon <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C151">Verbruggen <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>).

The chief characteristic used to separate the familiar genera <italic>Bangia</italic> and <italic>Porphyra</italic>, e.g. filament vs. blade, lacks taxonomic significance as these morphologies arose independently several times throughout the evolutionary diversification of the Bangiales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C117">Oliveira <italic>et al</italic>. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C103">Müller <italic>et al</italic>. 2001<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C104"><italic>b</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C15">Broom <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C64">Jones <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C102">Milstein and de Oliveira 2005</xref>). Molecular data do not support the distinction of <italic>Bangia</italic> and <italic>Porphyra</italic> as monophyletic genera, and analyses of these data have resulted in the transfer of a majority of species previously placed in <italic>Porphyra</italic>, including species of commercial value, to new genera (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C113">Nelson <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C146">Sutherland <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). DNA sequence analyses also suggest that the simple morphology of these organisms obscures significant levels of genetic diversity, including the presence of morphologically cryptic species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C88">Klein <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C106">Müller <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C112">Nelson <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C146">Sutherland <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>).

The representation of these species and isolates in current phylogenetic studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C146">Sutherland <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>) is insufficient to determine whether there is any relationship between nuclear DNA content and evolutionary patterns of the various Bangiophyceae lineages.The Florideophyceae includes five currently recognized subclasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C129">Saunders and Hommersand 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C92">Le Gall and Saunders 2007</xref>). DNA content estimates are available for representatives of the Nemaliophycidae, Corallinophycidae and Rhodymeniophycidae. The remaining two subclasses, Ahnfeltiophycidae and Hildenbrandiophycidae, while evolutionarily distinct, include only a small number of species. Genome size estimates are available for six of the nine currently recognized Nemaliophycidae orders, and the group is characterized by a nuclear 2C DNA content range of 0.2–2.8 pg (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS005F1">1</xref>).Molecular systematic investigations have resolved a close relationship among members of the Acrochaetiales, Palmariales, Colaconematales and Nemaliales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C132">Saunders <italic>et al.</italic> 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C61">Harper and Saunders 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C63">Huisman <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>), which are considered to represent early lineages of florideophytes.

Although the relationships of the Colaconematales and Nemaliales are poorly resolved in large red algal phylogenies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C92">Le Gall and Saunders 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C151">Verbruggen <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>), the more specific analysis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C26">Clayden and Saunders (2010)</xref> indicates a sister relationship between these orders.Nuclear DNA content data have been published for only one species of the Colaconematales, <italic>Colaconema daviesii</italic>, with 2C DNA = 0.6 pg, and are limited to two species of <italic>Audouinella</italic> in the Acrochaetiales [see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/pls005/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Additional Information</ext-link>]. Data available for species of the Nemaliales suggest that this order is characterized by one of the largest ranges of DNA contents (2C = 0.5–2.5 pg) of any of the florideophytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS005F1">1</xref>). The Palmariales, as presently delimited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C26">Clayden and Saunders 2010</xref>), includes three genera for which nuclear DNA content estimates are available: <italic>Devaleraea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C55">Guiry 1982</xref>), <italic>Palmaria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C54">Guiry 1974</xref>) and <italic>Rhodothamniella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C132">Saunders <italic>et al.</italic> 1995</xref>). A 2C range of 1.5–2.8 pg gives the Palmariales the largest mean nuclear DNA size in the florideophytes.Until recently, freshwater red algae belonging to the genera <italic>Thorea</italic> and <italic>Nemalionopsis</italic> were included in the order Batrachospermales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C90">Kumano 2002</xref>). Small subunit ribosomal DNA and <italic>rbc</italic>L sequence analyses indicate that the Thoreaceae has been misclassified in the Batrachospermales and should be placed in its own order, the Thoreales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C105">Müller <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>). Species in this order are characterized by having freshwater representatives with multiaxial gametophytes, a uniaxial chantransia stage and pit plugs with two cap layers, the outer one of which is usually plate like. Nuclear DNA content estimate data are available for only one species in this order, <italic>Thorea riekei</italic>, with 2C = 0.28 pg [see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/pls005/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Additional Information</ext-link>]. The Batrachospermales is distinguished from other freshwater rhodophyte orders based on a heterotrichous life history phase, lack of tetraspore production, and a two-layered pit plug, the outer layer of which is domed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C153">Vis <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>).The Batrachospermales and the Thoreales are of particular interest as they are exclusively freshwater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C152">Vis and Sheath 1997</xref>) in the Nemaliophycidae clade, which includes several additional orders that are primarily or at least partially freshwater: Acrochaetiales, Balbiniales, Balliales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C60">Harper and Saunders 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C103">Müller <italic>et al</italic>. 2001<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C104"><italic>b</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C92">Le Gall and Saunders 2007</xref>). As members of the distantly related Compsopogonales (Compsopogonophyceae) are primarily freshwater as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C139">Sheath 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C105">Müller <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>), it is likely that adaptation to freshwater habitats involved multiple, independent events in the evolution of red algae.The genus <italic>Batrachospermum</italic> appears to be polyphyletic, comprising many morphologically similar but distantly related taxa (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C20">Chiasson <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C86">Kapraun <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). Species of <italic>Batrachospermum</italic>, <italic>Sirodotia</italic> and <italic>Tuomeya</italic> (Batrachospermaceae) investigated in the present study have 2C nuclear DNA contents of about 0.2–0.6 pg, while species of <italic>Lemanea</italic> and <italic>Paralemanea</italic> (Lemaneaceae) have noticeably larger 2C genome sizes of 1.0–1.6 pg [see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/pls005/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Additional Information</ext-link>]. Results of this study suggest a possible correlation between polyploidy and the expression of the <italic>Batrachospermum</italic> or <italic>Lemanea</italic> morphological phenotypes.Published karyological studies for Batrachospermaceae indicate that most species have chromosome numbers in the range of 1<italic>n</italic> = 3–5 or 10–12, while Lemaneaceae species have chromosome complements of 1<italic>n</italic> = 15–20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C86">Kapraun <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). Both the larger genome sizes and chromosome complements in <italic>Lemanea</italic> and <italic>Paralemanea</italic> are consistent with polyploidy events in their common ancestry.A unique pattern of somatic meiosis has been described in members of this order associated with development of haploid gametophytes from vegetative branches of the microscopic, diploid sporophyte phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C109">Necchi and Carmona 2002</xref>).

The recent multigene study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C92">Le Gall and Saunders (2007)</xref> demonstrated that the Corallinales and Rhodogorgonales represented a separate evolutionary lineage from the Nemaliophycidae, and established the Corallinophycidae. The analyses of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C151">Verbruggen <italic>et al.</italic> (2010)</xref> supported this classification and the inclusion of the Sporolithales in this subclass as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C92">Le Gall and Saunders (2007)</xref>.Nuclear DNA content data are only available from species in the Corallinales where 2C DNA contents range from 0.1 to 1.3 pg (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS005F1">1</xref>) [see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/pls005/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Additional Information</ext-link>]. Coralline algae can be divided into two types: geniculate (with alternating calcified internodes and uncalcified nodes) and non-geniculate (which usually grow as crusts) (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C160">Woelkerling <italic>et al</italic>. 1993</xref>). Recently, molecular studies demonstrated that genicula are non-homologous structures that evolved independently in several families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C1">Bailey and Chapman 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C2">1998</xref>). When DNA content data are superimposed on this molecular phylogeny, it becomes apparent that geniculate clades are represented by species with larger nuclear genomes (0.6–1.3 pg) while non-geniculate clades contain species with relatively small nuclear genomes (0.1–1.0 pg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C71">Kapraun 2005</xref>). Analysis of additional species will be required to determine whether these observations reflect a sampling artefact.Ordinal classification within the Rhodymeniophycidae continues to be refined, in large part as a result of distinct evolutionary lineages being recognized within the large, polyphyletic Gigartinales (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C158">Withall and Saunders 2006</xref>). The subclass currently includes 12 orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C129">Saunders and Hommersand 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C56">Guiry and Guiry 2011</xref>), with DNA content estimates available for species in nine of these (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS005F1">1</xref>). While the overall 2C DNA content range of 0.2–2.8 pg is relatively wide, five of the orders (Gelidiales, Gigartinales, Gracilariales, Halymeniales and Rhodymeniales) have particularly narrow ranges of DNA contents [see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/pls005/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Additional Information</ext-link>].The relatively narrow range of small DNA content values but substantial range of chromosome numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C73">Kapraun and Bailey 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C40">Freshwater 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C82">Kapraun <italic>et al.</italic> 1993<italic>b</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C83">1994</xref>), and the absence of a correlation between nuclear genome size and chromosome number suggest a significant role of aneuploidy in Gelidialean evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C74">Kapraun and Dunwoody 2002</xref>). Analyses of DNA sequence data from a variety of loci have resulted in a consistent molecular phylogeny for the Gelidiales (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C41">Freshwater and Bailey 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C142">Shimada <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C149">Thomas and Freshwater 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C150">Tronchin and Freshwater 2007</xref>). This well-circumscribed order includes only a handful of genera, but is particularly species rich (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C101">Millar and Freshwater 2005</xref>), and it would be very interesting to explore the possible role of aneuploidy in their evolution by obtaining additional chromosome and genome size data for representative species.This order was separated from the Nemaliales on the basis of their then known alternation of generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C36">Feldmann and Feldmann 1942</xref>). It is now known that this life history pattern lacks taxonomic significance as some Nemaliales are heteromorphic and some Bonnemaisoniales are isomorphic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C161">Womersley 1996</xref>). For example, <italic>Bonnemaisonia asparagoides</italic> (Woodward) C. Agardh is monoecious and has a direct life history with no tetrasporophyte, while <italic>Bonnemaisonia clavata</italic> G. Hamel is dioecious and has an alternation of heteromorphic generations with ‘<italic>Hymenoclonium serpens</italic>’ representing the tetrasporophyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C126">Salvador Soler <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). The Bonnemaisoniales are currently recognized at the ordinal level on the morphological basis of their apical development pattern and direct development of the gonimoblast. Ultrastructural details of pit plugs and caps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C123">Pueschel 1989</xref>) and plastids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C21">Chihara and Yoshizaki 1972</xref>), as well as molecular studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C134">Saunders <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C92">Le Gall and Saunders 2007</xref>), appear to support retention of this order.In a recent study (N. Salvador Soler, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain, unpubl. res.) and the current study, nuclear DNA content data for ‘<italic>Falkenbergia rufolanosa</italic>’, the diploid sporophyte phase of the heteromorphic species <italic>Asparagopsis armata</italic>, and for the isomorphic species <italic>Delisea plumosa</italic> and <italic>Ptilonia willana</italic>, suggest 2C values for members of this order of 0.5–0.6 pg. Nuclear DNA content data for both phases of the heteromorphic species in the Bonnemaisoniales are needed to confirm that ploidy level shifts (2<italic>n</italic>/4<italic>n</italic>) are associated with the gametophyte and sporophyte phases, respectively.<bold>Estimated 2C nuclear DNA contents superimposed on a family phylogeny for the Ceramiales.</bold> Phylogeny based on analyses of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C25">Choi <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> with unsupported nodes collapsed to polytomies.

Unless an assumption is made that the other taxa in the Rhodymeniophycidae lineage have experienced nuclear genome size decrease, an explanation is required to account for the larger genome sizes in the Ceramiales.Although the existence of mechanisms for decreasing DNA amounts have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C156">Wendel <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>), it is more probable that polyploidy and transposable element amplification will result in genome size increase through time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C11">Bennetzen 2002</xref>), ultimately resulting in genomic ‘obesity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C12">Bennetzen and Kellogg 1997</xref>). Since the Ceramiales are arguably the oldest members of the Rhodymeniophycidae lineage, they would have accumulated the largest genomes and may have been subject to a predictable genomic expansion. Although data are severely limited, there appears to be a correlation between antiquity of these red algal lineages and their mean nuclear DNA contents.The Gigartinales is a large and diverse order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C39">Fredericq <italic>et al</italic>. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C62">Hommersand <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C148">Tai <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C134">Saunders <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>) including commercially important carrageenophytes such as <italic>Eucheuma</italic>, <italic>Kappaphycus</italic> and <italic>Chondrus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C32">Craigie 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C70">Kapraun 1999</xref>).

The genome size (1C) of <italic>Chondrus crispus</italic> was estimated as 150 Mbp using flow cytometry of haploid nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C93">Le Gall <italic>et al</italic>. 1993</xref>), but recent complete sequencing of this genome indicates a size of only 105 Mbp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C29">Collén 2011</xref>) concordant with previous estimates using static microspectrophotometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C71">Kapraun 2005</xref>). This relatively small size and the species' economic importance made <italic>Chondrus</italic> an ideal candidate among carrageenophytes for genome sequencing.The Halymeniales is a relatively large order of 270+ species classified in 26 currently recognized genera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C56">Guiry and Guiry 2011</xref>). Currently, 2C DNA content data are only available for two species, <italic>Grateloupia filicina</italic> (Lamouroux) C. Agardh and <italic>Halymenia floridana</italic> J. Agardh, with both having identical values (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS005F1">1</xref>) [see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/pls005/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Additional Information</ext-link>].Recent studies have reinstated the Nemastomatales and established the Sebdeniales for species previously part of the Gigartinales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C130">Saunders and Kraft 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C158">Withall and Saunders 2006</xref>). Although the orders are represented by relatively few species, molecular and morphological analyses reveal additional diversity (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C136">Schneider <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). Currently, estimates of 2C DNA content are only available for two <italic>Predaea</italic> (Nemastomatales) and one <italic>Sebdenia</italic> (Sebdeniales) species (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS005F1">1</xref>) [see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/pls005/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Additional Information</ext-link>].This order includes relatively few genera, but some of them, e.g., <italic>Gracilaria</italic>, are species rich (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C38">Fredericq and Hommersand 1990</xref>). No new nuclear DNA content estimates are available for this order, but previous data indicate that nuclear genome sizes are small (0.3–0.5 pg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C68">Kapraun 1993<italic>b</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C71">2005</xref>). The Gracilariales, unlike the Gelidiales, is noted for genome size constancy, with all species of <italic>Gracilaria</italic> investigated having identical 2C DNA contents of 0.4 pg and chromosome complements of 2<italic>n</italic> = 48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C75">Kapraun and Dutcher 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C67">Kapraun 1993<italic>a</italic></xref>).

This order, along with the Gelidiales and Gracilariales, has both a narrow range and a small mean nuclear genome size (2C = 0.3–0.6 pg).The size of the red algal genomes reported here and previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C71">Kapraun 2005</xref>) is best appreciated when compared with the minimum amount of DNA estimated for specifying the mRNA sequences required for angiosperm development. Specifically, the genomes of <italic>Genlisea margaretae</italic> Hutchinson and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (L.) Heynhold, with 2C = 126 and 314 Mb, respectively, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C124">Riechmann <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C10">Bennett <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C53">Greilhuber <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>), are among the smallest found in angiosperms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C8">Bennett and Smith 1976</xref>), but still have 1.5–2 times the estimated 15 000 genes per haploid genome required for development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C37">Flavell, 1980</xref>). Similarly, the genome of the green alga <italic>Volvox carteri</italic> F. Stein, with 138 Mbp, has an estimated coding potential for 14 500 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C122">Prochnik <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>). Even the smallest rhodophyte genome reported (e.g. 1C = 98 Mb in <italic>Compsopogon coerulus</italic>), with its probable genomic redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C71">Kapraun 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C72">2007</xref>), has the genic capacity for morphologically complex development.<bold>Comparison of 4C nuclear DNA contents and 2<italic>n</italic> chromosome complements for 33 species of Florideophyceae.</bold> DNA content values from the present study and previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C71">Kapraun 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C86">Kapraun <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C127">Salvador Soler <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>), and 2<italic>n</italic> chromosome complements from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C27">Cole (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C71">Kapraun (2005)</xref>.Although no correlation is apparent between phylogenetic placement and genome size, groups considered to be basal (Cyanidiophytina, Porphyridiophyceae, Stylonematophyceae, Compsopogonophyceae, Rhodellophyceae) generally have genome sizes ≤0.5 pg, while derived groups (Bangiophyceae, Florideophyceae) generally have genome sizes ≥0.5 pg, with values up to 2.8 pg reported. DNA contents may be diagnostic, synapomorphies in both the Corallinales and Batrachospermales. In the Corallinales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C71">Kapraun 2005</xref>), geniculate clades are represented by species with larger nuclear genomes (0.6–1.3 pg) while non-geniculate clades contain species with relatively small nuclear genomes (0.1–1.0 pg), the overlap in these ranges is a result of single outlier species. Similarly, in the Batrachospermales, species of <italic>Batrachospermum</italic>, <italic>Sirodotia</italic> and <italic>Tuomeya</italic> have 2C nuclear DNA contents of 0.2–0.6 pg while species of <italic>Lemanea</italic> and <italic>Paralemanea</italic> have noticeably larger 2C genome sizes of 1.0–1.6 pg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C86">Kapraun <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>) [see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/pls005/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Additional Information</ext-link>]. More definitive trends may be revealed as data for nuclear genome size and our understanding of red algal evolutionary relationships increase.It is likely that adaptation to freshwater habitats involved multiple, independent events in the evolution of red algae. In the present study, no correlation between nuclear genome size and adaptation to freshwater habitats is apparent in the Compsopogonales, Thoreales and Batrachospermales.In a previous investigation of the relationship of nuclear genome size to reproductive cell parameters in the Rhodophyta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C74">Kapraun and Dunwoody 2002</xref>), three general trends regarding carpospore production were noted: (i) increase in genome size was positively correlated with increase in carpospore volume; (ii) species with larger genome sizes produced fewer carpospores; and (iii) species that produced larger carpospores produce fewer carpospores. Members of the Ceramiales, with their larger genome sizes, typically produce fewer, but larger carpospores and generally behave as predicted in a <italic>K</italic>-selection model. In contrast, members of the Gelidiales, Gigartinales and Gracilariales, with their smaller genome sizes, typically produce large numbers of small carpospores as predicted in an <italic>r</italic>-selected model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C74">Kapraun and Dunwoody 2002</xref>). The conspicuous limitation of this ecological model is that the Ceramiales generally produce small, structurally simple, short-lived plants (associated with <italic>r</italic>-selection), while the other orders generally produce large, structurally complex, long-lived plants (associated with <italic>K</italic>-selection).In the present study, cyanidophytes represent the earliest diverging red algal lineage and have reported genome sizes of 1C = 0.02–0.1 pg (1C = 10–55 Mbp) and 2<italic>n</italic> chromosome numbers between 4 and 20 [see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/pls005/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Additional Information</ext-link>]. These genomic characteristics recommend this group for further investigations that could possibly help characterize the nuclear genome in unicellular organisms prior to the transition to multicellularity seen in other red algae. Among the basal Rhodophytina, members of the Compsopogonophyceae, Porphyridiophyceae and Stylonematophyceae may represent appropriate candidates for investigations of nuclear genomes in extant, basal red algae. For example, <italic>Compsopogon caeruleus</italic> has a 2C DNA content of 0.25 pg (1C = 98 Mb) and a reported chromosome complement of 1<italic>n</italic> = 7 ± 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C114">Nichols 1964</xref>). Small genome size and chromosome complements have been reported in <italic>Porphyridium aerugineum</italic> Geitler (<italic>n</italic> = 2) and <italic>P. purpureum</italic> (Bory de Saint-Vincent) K.M. Drew &amp; R. Ross [as <italic>P. cruentum</italic> (S.F. Gray) Nägeli] (<italic>n</italic> = 2; 2C DNA content = 0.1 pg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C144">Sommerfeld and Nichols 1970</xref>), although it remains unclear whether these represent haploid or diploid values.DNA C-value remains a key character in biology, biodiversity and molecular investigations as genome size has many important practical implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C9">Bennett <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>). Genome size directly influences the cost and difficulty of sequencing projects, and was a primary consideration in choosing subjects for early whole-genome analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C50">Gregory 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C51">2005</xref>), including those of algae where small DNA content (haploid genomes ∼100 Mbp) has been a major criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C118">Peters <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C155">Waaland <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>). Despite major improvements in sequencing cost and efficiency provided by current next-generation sequencing technology, genome size is still a consideration for coverage and <italic>de novo</italic> assembly. Many red algal species have haploid genomes in the range of 127–300 Mbp [see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/pls005/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Additional Information</ext-link>], and the present study provides a list of target species with small genome sizes for whole-genome sequencing studies. Many of these species (e.g. Gelidiales and Gracilariales) are also amenable to culture and are of significant ecological and/or commercial importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C95">López-Bautista and Kapraun 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C77">Kapraun and López-Bautista 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C70">Kapraun 1999</xref>).Early diverging red algal lineages are characterized by relatively small 2C DNA contents while a wide range of 2C values is found within the derived Florideophyceae. An overall correlation between phylogenetic placement and 2C DNA content is not apparent; however, genome size data are available for only a small portion of red algae. Current data do support polyploidy and aneuploidy as pervasive features of red algal genome evolution.Red algae that warrant further investigation include the Nemaliales, Acrochaetiales and Colaconematales. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that these three orders are part of early diverging florideophycean lineages (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C92">Le Gall and Saunders 2007</xref>), are widely distributed and contain many genera that are species rich (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C132">Saunders <italic>et al</italic>. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C59">Harper and Saunders 1998</xref>), yet published information about their genome sizes is very limited. It would be of interest to determine whether the relatively wide range of DNA contents found in the Nemaliales occurs in these other related orders.Another group of red algae that warrant attention is the Ceramiales, especially the Rhodomelaceae, which may include more species than all other red algae combined. Continuing molecular phylogenetic investigations provide us with evolutionary schemes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C99">Martin-Lescanne <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS005C97">Mamoozadeh and Freshwater 2011</xref>) upon which genome size data can be superimposed to reveal the extent that speciation was accompanied by nuclear transformations.<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/pls005/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">The following additional information is available in the online version of this article –</ext-link><bold>File 1.</bold> Appendix I—Chromosome numbers and nuclear DNA content estimates in isolates and species of red algae.<bold>File 2.</bold> Notes on Appendix I.<bold>File 3.</bold> Numbered references for chromosome complements and DNA content estimates in the Rhodophyta cited in Appendix I.The work was funded by the <grant-sponsor xlink:type="simple">United States National Science Foundation</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num xlink:type="simple">#0742437</grant-num>) and the <grant-sponsor xlink:type="simple">CMS DNA Algal Trust</grant-sponsor>.
