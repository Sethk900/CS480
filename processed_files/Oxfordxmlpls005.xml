This paper compiles and discusses all currently available nuclear genome size data for red algae in relation to their most recent taxonomic classification.  The red algae are an evolutionarily ancient group of predominantly marine organisms with an estimated 6000 species. Consensus higher-level molecular phylogenies support a basal split between the unicellular Cyanidiophytina and morphologically diverse Rhodophytina, the later subphylum containing most red algal species. The Rhodophytina is divided into six classes, of which five represent early diverging lineages of generally uninucleate species, whose evolutionary relationships are poorly resolved. The remaining species compose the large (27 currently recognized orders), morphologically diverse and typically multinucleate Florideophyceae. Nuclear DNA content estimates have been published for &lt;1 % of the described red algae. The present investigation summarizes the state of our knowledge and expands our coverage of DNA content information from 196 isolates of red algae.  The DNA-localizing fluorochrome DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) and RBC (chicken erythrocytes) standards were used to estimate 2C values with static microspectrophotometry.  Nuclear DNA contents are reported for 196 isolates of red algae, almost doubling the number of estimates available for these organisms. Present results also confirm the reported DNA content range of 0.1–2.8 pg, with species of Ceramiales, Nemaliales and Palmariales containing apparently polyploid genomes with 2C = 2.8, 2.3 and 2.8 pg, respectively.  Early diverging red algal lineages are characterized by relatively small 2C DNA contents while a wide range of 2C values is found within the derived Florideophyceae. An overall correlation between phylogenetic placement and 2C DNA content is not apparent; however, genome size data are available for only a small portion of red algae. Current data do support polyploidy and aneuploidy as pervasive features of red algal genome evolution.  The Second Plant Genome Size Workshop and Discussion Meeting (hosted by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, 8–12 September 2003) identified major gaps (systematic, regional and plant type) in our knowledge of plant DNA amounts ( Bennett and Leitch 2005 a  ,   b  ). It was noted that no database was available for algae. This major gap was addressed with a compilation of genome size estimates for 247 species of macroscopic marine algae, including data for 95 isolates and species of red algae ( Kapraun 2005 ). These data have been incorporated into a database of plant genome sizes ( Kapraun  et al . 2004 ) compiled and hosted by the Royal Botanic Gardens (RBG) Kew web page ( http://data.kew.org/cvalues/ ). A subsequent investigation of green algae resulted in an expansion of coverage and characterization of the ancestral land plant flagellate genome ( Kapraun 2007 ). More recently, efforts to expand coverage of DNA contents in brown algae were published ( Phillips  et al . 2011 ). This final report in the series summarizes nuclear DNA content data for red algae, both from our continuing investigations and from the literature. Results are updated at  http://people.uncw.edu/kapraund/DNA  (see links to ‘Rhodophyta’). The present paper provides nuclear genome size estimates for 77 additional isolates of red algae and compiles all available data (196 species/isolates) into a single resource [see  Additional Information ]. Of this new list, 40 resulted from our ongoing research. Unicellular microalgae and freshwater red algae, which were previously under-represented ( Kapraun 2005 ), are emphasized here.  Inclusion of published nuclear DNA content data for red algae in the present report was sometimes problematic. The Second Plant Genome Size Workshop and Discussion Meeting ( Bennett and Leitch 2005 b  ) identified ‘best practice’ methodology for nuclear genome size estimation in plant tissues. Virtually none of the published genome size data for algae resulted from investigations adhering to all of the best practice recommendations, primarily because measurement of the relatively small algal nuclear genomes requires standard species different from those specified as appropriate for vascular plants ( Doležel  et al.  1998 ;  Kapraun 2005 ). A comprehensive discussion on standard species and methods is included in the section ‘Notes on Appendix I’.  The red algae (Rhodophyta) are predominantly marine organisms with &gt;700 genera and 6000 species described in 38 orders ( Guiry and Guiry 2011 ). The Rhodophyta are characterized by unstacked thylakoids in plastids, plastids containing the accessory pigments phycoerythrin, phycocyanin and allophycocyanin arranged in phycobilisomes, the lack of plastid endoplasmic reticulum, the presence of pit connections between cells in filamentous genera and the absence of flagellated cells in the life history ( Woelkerling 1990 ). There are a variety of current higher-level classification schemes for red algae ( Saunders and Hommersand 2004 ;  Yoon  et al.  2006 ;  Guiry and Guiry 2011 ). Molecular analyses ( Oliveira and Bhattacharya 2000 ;  Yoon  et al.  2002 a  ,   b  ,  2006 ) and organelle ultrastructure ( Pueschel 1989 ;  Scott and Broadwater 1990 ) support an early divergence for the Cyanidiales, which are resolved as a sister group to other red algae and classified as a separate subphylum (Cyanidiophytina). The remaining Rhodophyta are divided into six classes that are grouped as a single subphyllum ( Yoon  et al.  2006 ) or multiple subphyla ( Saunders and Hommersand 2004 ;  Guiry and Guiry 2011 ). Five of these classes, Porphyridiophyceae, Stylonematophyceae, Compsopogonophyceae, Rhodellophyceae and Bangiophyceae, are early diverging lineages of generally uninucleate species, whose evolutionary relationships are poorly resolved ( Yoon  et al.  2006 ;  Verbruggen  et al.  2010 ). These five classes represent about 1 % of the total number of described red algal species. The remaining species are typically multinucleate and classified within the Florideophyceae, a large class of 27 currently recognized orders falling within five subclasses represented by clades that terminate long, basally positioned branches in molecular phylogenies with specific synapomorphic pit plug characteristics ( Saunders and Bailey 1997 ;  Le Gall and Saunders 2007 ;  Verbruggen  et al.  2010 ).  The traditional view that the Acrochaetiales are the most primitive and the Ceramiales are the most highly derived of the florideophycidean red algal orders ( Kylin 1956 ;  Dixon 1973 ) is not supported by molecular data (e.g.  Le Gall and Saunders 2007 ;  Verbruggen  et al.  2010 ). A more complex phylogenetic model is emerging for red algae, characterized by ancient lineages often terminating in modern radiations ( Yoon  et al . 2006 ;  Le Gall and Saunders 2007 ;  Verbruggen  et al.  2010 ).  New availability of both a DNA C-values database ( Kapraun  et al . 2004 ) and consensus higher-level phylogenies has opened the way for determining evolutionary trends in DNA amounts for other red algae ( Kapraun 2005 ). The present static microspectrophotometric investigation of additional species of red algae was initiated to determine the extent of nuclear DNA content variation, to identify any correlation between genome size and phylogenetic relationships, and to corroborate an alternation of haploid and diploid nuclear DNA contents in gametophyte and sporophyte tissue, respectively, of selected species.  Species collection data and/or source of cultures for newly reported data are summarized at  http://people.uncw.edu/kapraund/DNA  (see links to ‘Rhodophyta’). Algal material was fixed in Carnoy's solution ( Kapraun 2005 ) and stored in 70 % ethanol at 4 °C. Selected specimens were rehydrated in water and softened in 5 % w/v ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( Goff and Coleman 1986 ,  1987 ,  1990 ) for 12–48 h. Algal specimens were transferred to coverslips treated with subbing solution, and then air dried and stained with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (0.5 μg mL −1 ) (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO, USA) as previously described ( Goff and Coleman 1986 ,  1987 ,  1990 ;  Kapraun and Nguyen 1994 ). Nuclear DNA contents were based on estimates from both microspectrophotometry and image analysis. Microspectrophotometry with DAPI followed procedures published previously ( Kapraun and Nguyen 1994 ;  Kapraun  et al . 2007 ) using a protocol modified after  Goff and Coleman (1990) . Nuclear DNA content estimates based on image analysis of DAPI-stained specimens followed a procedure modified from  Kapraun and Dunwoody (2002)  and  Choi  et al . (2004) , using a Cooled CCD Miramax RTE 782-Y high-performance digital camera placed on a Leica DMRB fluorescence microscope and analysed with MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) ( Gómez  et al . 2010 ). For a comprehensive review of the theory and practice of DNA quantification by densitometry, see  Hardie  et al . (2002) .  Nuclear DNA contents of algal specimens were estimated by comparing their  I  f  values with those of chicken erythrocytes (RBC) ( Kapraun 1994 ;  Kapraun and Dunwoody 2002 ). The rationale for accepting 2C DNA = 2.4 pg as the standard is included in ‘Notes on Appendix I, Section (f)’ [see  Additional Information ]. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole binds by a non-intercalative mechanism to adenine- and thymine-rich regions of DNA that contain at least four A-T base pairs ( Portugal and Waring 1988 ). Consequently, chicken erythrocytes can be used directly as standards for determining amounts of DNA only when the A–T contents of both standard and experimental DNA are equivalent ( Coleman  et al . 1981 ). Chicken has a nuclear DNA base composition of 42–43 mol% G + C ( Marmur and Doty 1962 ). Limited published data for the Rhodophyta indicate values in the range of 35–42 mol% G + C ( Freshwater  et al . 1990 ;  Le Gall  et al . 1993 ;  Kapraun  et al . 1993 a   , 1996 ). Members of the Rhodophyta investigated in this study are assumed to have a similar range of base pair compositions, and the linearity is accepted between DAPI–DNA binding in both RBC and algal samples ( Le Gall  et al . 1993 ).  The Rhodophyta include taxa with some or all of their cells being multinucleate or endopolyploid ( Kapraun and Nguyen 1994 ;  Kapraun 2005 ) as well as taxa that exhibit a nuclear ‘incremental size decrease associated with a cascading down of DNA contents’ ( Kapraun 1994 ). Methodologies were developed for specific specimens to permit assignment of C level and interpretation of  I  f  data. However, assignment of estimated nuclear DNA contents to specific C-values in the present study is presumptive in that no karyological investigations were conducted on the algal samples used for nuclear DNA content estimates.  Previously unpublished nuclear DNA content data in Appendix I are indicated by (°).  Supplementary materials and methods , information for collection locations and data for number of algal nuclei examined in each sample and estimates of nuclear genome size (pg) ± SD are available at  http://people.uncw.edu/kapraun/DNA . Nuclear DNA content data are also incorporated into a database of plant genome sizes ( Kapraun 2005 ;  Gregory  et al . 2007 ) hosted by the RBG Kew web page ( http://data.kew.org/cvalues/ ).  Red algal DNA contents are presented following the two subphylum classification schemes of  Yoon  et al.  (2006)  and florideophycean classification of  Saunders and Hommersand (2004)  and  Le Gall and Saunders (2007) .  The Cyanidiophyceae are small, unicellular, anciently diverged red algae ( Barbier  et al.  2005 ;  Coppin  et al.  2005 ) whose evolutionary relationships remain a subject of controversy ( Garbary  et al . 1980 ;  Gabrielson  et al . 1985 ;  Seckbach 1999 ;  Müller  et al . 2001 a  ;  Yoon  et al.  2006 ). Molecular data support their placement as sister to the other Rhodophyta ( Saunders and Hommersand 2004 ;  Yoon  et al.  2006 ), but the unique attributes of these organisms ( Coppin  et al.  2005 ) provide a sense that the cyanidiophytes are as distinct from other red algae as are phyla in the plant and animal kingdoms relative to one another ( Saunders and Hommersand 2004 ;  Yoon  et al . 2004 ,  2006 ). Putative synapomorphies of the cyanidiophytes include a blue-green colour resulting from the presence of α-chlorophyll and C-phycoerythrin, complete lack of the red phycoerythrins ( De Luca  et al . 1978 ) and an ability to inhabit hot, acidic waters (acidothermophilic) ( Seckbach 1999 ). The cyanidiophytes are reported to have the smallest known genomes of any phototrophic eukaryotes ( Matsuzaki  et al . 2004 ). Pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and Feulgen microspectrophotometry with  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  Meyen  ex  Reess standard have yielded 1C nuclear genome size estimates of 10–16 Mbp ( Suzuki  et al . 1992 ;  Maleszka 1993 ;  Matsuzaki  et al . 2004 ;  Barbier  et al . 2005 ) and 1.35–2.25 × 10 −2  pg ( Muravenko  et al . 2001 ) in eight isolates and species of these extremophile algae [see  Additional Information ]. The size of the nuclear genome in  Cyanidioschyzon  reported in the last decade has doubled as a result of progress in measuring techniques ( Matsuzaki  et al . 2004 ). It is assumed that these recent values are more accurate. Consequently, earlier nuclear genome size estimates listed here should be treated with caution.  These classes were traditionally included with the Bangiophyceae in a group variously classified as a subphylum or subclass. Early molecular studies indicated that this was a polyphyletic grouping of distinct lineages (e.g.  Freshwater  et al.  1994 ;  Müller  et al.  2001 b  ), and recent studies have assigned these lineages to separate classes (e.g.  Saunders and Hommersand 2004 ;  Yoon  et al.  2006 ). The Porphyridiophyceae consists solely of unicellular forms including  Porphyridium  and  Flintiella , while unicellular and pseudofilamentous taxa such as  Rhodosorus ,  Stylonema  and  Goniotrichopsis  make up the Stylonematophyceae ( West  et al.  2005 ;  Yoon  et al.  2006 ). The Compsopogonophyceae includes taxa of various morphologies that have been treated as separate families ( Rintoul  et al.  1999 ) or orders ( Silva  et al.  1996 ), but which form a monophyletic lineage in most analyses (e.g.  Yoon  et al.  2006 ;  Verbruggen  et al.  2010 ). The Rhodellophyceae is another group of primarily unicells such as  Dixoniella  and  Rhodella . Relationships among these lineages are similar in the concatenated multilocus DNA sequence analyses of  Yoon  et al.  (2006)  and  Verbruggen  et al.  (2010) , but these relationships are poorly supported.   Estimated 2C nuclear DNA contents superimposed on a consensus red algal phylogeny.  Phylogeny based on the analyses of  Yoon  et al.  (2006) ,  Le Gall and Saunders (2007)  and  Verbruggen  et al.  (2010)  with unsupported nodes in these analyses collapsed to polytomies. Branch labels follow the two-subphylum classification of  Yoon  et al.  (2006)  and florideophycean classification of  Saunders and Hommersand (2004)  and  Le Gall and Saunders (2007) . Dots represent individual DNA content estimates; lines represent the range of values for multiple species.  This class, as presently understood is monophyletic and includes 15 currently recognized extant genera (some still unnamed) ( Sutherland  et al.  2011 ). The chief characteristic used to separate the familiar genera  Bangia  and  Porphyra , e.g. filament vs. blade, lacks taxonomic significance as these morphologies arose independently several times throughout the evolutionary diversification of the Bangiales ( Oliveira  et al . 1995 ;  Müller  et al . 2001 a  ,   b  ;  Broom  et al . 2004 ;  Jones  et al . 2004 ;  Milstein and de Oliveira 2005 ). Molecular data do not support the distinction of  Bangia  and  Porphyra  as monophyletic genera, and analyses of these data have resulted in the transfer of a majority of species previously placed in  Porphyra , including species of commercial value, to new genera (e.g.  Nelson  et al.  2006 ;  Sutherland  et al.  2011 ). DNA sequence analyses also suggest that the simple morphology of these organisms obscures significant levels of genetic diversity, including the presence of morphologically cryptic species ( Klein  et al . 2003 ;  Müller  et al . 2003 ;  Nelson  et al . 2003 ;  Sutherland  et al.  2011 ). Recently, two species of  Porphyra  were transferred to two new genera,  Pyrophyllon  and  Chlidophyllon , which are included in the Erythropeltidales (Compsopogonophyceae) ( Nelson  et al . 2003 ). In addition to clarifying taxonomic classifications and identifying cryptic species, molecular data have been useful in recognizing the conspecific status of some widely distributed species ( Broom  et al . 2002 ;  Neefus and Brodie 2009 ), including  Pyropia suborbiculata  (Kjellm.) J.E. Sutherl., H.G. Choi, M.S. Hwang  et  W.A. Nelson and  Pyropia elongata  (Kylin) Neefus  et  J. Brodie, which we investigated previously as  Porphyra carolinensis  Coll  et  J. Cox and  Porphyra rosengurtii  Coll  et  J. Cox, respectively ( Kapraun and Freshwater 1987 ;  Kapraun  et al.  1991 ;  Kapraun 2005 ). Transfer of the  Pyropia spiralis  (E.C. Oliveira  et  Coll) M.C. Oliveira, D. Milstein  et  E.C. Oliveira variety previously studied as  Porphyra spiralis  var.  amplifolia  E.C. Oliveira  et  Coll is needed after the generic reclassification of  Sutherland  et al.  (2011)  and is effected here:   Pyropia spiralis  (E.C. Oliveira  et  Coll) M.C. Oliveira, D. Milstein  et  E.C. Oliveira var.  amplifolia  (E.C. Oliveira  et  Coll) Freshwater  et  Kapraun comb. nov.  Basionym:  Porphyra spiralis  var.  amplifolia  E.C.  Oliveira and Coll (1975 : p. 196, Figs 3, 10).  In the eight isolates of  Bangia ,  Porphyra  and  Pyropia  investigated, neither estimates of 2C nuclear DNA contents, which range from 0.6 to 1.2 pg, nor published chromosome complements, which range from 1 n  = 3–5, appear to be genus specific ( Kapraun 2005 ). The representation of these species and isolates in current phylogenetic studies (e.g.  Sutherland  et al.  2011 ) is insufficient to determine whether there is any relationship between nuclear DNA content and evolutionary patterns of the various Bangiophyceae lineages.  The Florideophyceae includes five currently recognized subclasses ( Saunders and Hommersand 2004 ;  Le Gall and Saunders 2007 ). DNA content estimates are available for representatives of the Nemaliophycidae, Corallinophycidae and Rhodymeniophycidae. The remaining two subclasses, Ahnfeltiophycidae and Hildenbrandiophycidae, while evolutionarily distinct, include only a small number of species. Genome size estimates are available for six of the nine currently recognized Nemaliophycidae orders, and the group is characterized by a nuclear 2C DNA content range of 0.2–2.8 pg (Fig.  1 ).  Molecular systematic investigations have resolved a close relationship among members of the Acrochaetiales, Palmariales, Colaconematales and Nemaliales ( Saunders  et al.  1995 ;  Harper and Saunders 2002 ;  Huisman  et al.  2004 ), which are considered to represent early lineages of florideophytes. The transfer of  Rhodothamniella floridula  (Dillwyn) Feldmann from the Acrochaetiales ( Saunders  et al.  1995 ) and segregation of the Colaconematales ( Harper and Saunders 2002 ) has resulted in a monophyletic Acrochaetiales that is sister to the Palmariales (e.g.  Clayden and Saunders 2010 ). Although the relationships of the Colaconematales and Nemaliales are poorly resolved in large red algal phylogenies ( Le Gall and Saunders 2007 ;  Verbruggen  et al.  2010 ), the more specific analysis of  Clayden and Saunders (2010)  indicates a sister relationship between these orders.  Nuclear DNA content data have been published for only one species of the Colaconematales,  Colaconema daviesii , with 2C DNA = 0.6 pg, and are limited to two species of  Audouinella  in the Acrochaetiales [see  Additional Information ]. Data available for species of the Nemaliales suggest that this order is characterized by one of the largest ranges of DNA contents (2C = 0.5–2.5 pg) of any of the florideophytes (Fig.  1 ). The Palmariales, as presently delimited ( Clayden and Saunders 2010 ), includes three genera for which nuclear DNA content estimates are available:  Devaleraea  ( Guiry 1982 ),  Palmaria  ( Guiry 1974 ) and  Rhodothamniella  ( Saunders  et al.  1995 ). A 2C range of 1.5–2.8 pg gives the Palmariales the largest mean nuclear DNA size in the florideophytes.  Until recently, freshwater red algae belonging to the genera  Thorea  and  Nemalionopsis  were included in the order Batrachospermales ( Kumano 2002 ). Small subunit ribosomal DNA and  rbc L sequence analyses indicate that the Thoreaceae has been misclassified in the Batrachospermales and should be placed in its own order, the Thoreales ( Müller  et al . 2002 ). Species in this order are characterized by having freshwater representatives with multiaxial gametophytes, a uniaxial chantransia stage and pit plugs with two cap layers, the outer one of which is usually plate like. Nuclear DNA content estimate data are available for only one species in this order,  Thorea riekei , with 2C = 0.28 pg [see  Additional Information ]. The Batrachospermales is distinguished from other freshwater rhodophyte orders based on a heterotrichous life history phase, lack of tetraspore production, and a two-layered pit plug, the outer layer of which is domed ( Vis  et al . 1998 ).  The Batrachospermales and the Thoreales are of particular interest as they are exclusively freshwater ( Vis and Sheath 1997 ) in the Nemaliophycidae clade, which includes several additional orders that are primarily or at least partially freshwater: Acrochaetiales, Balbiniales, Balliales ( Harper and Saunders 2001 ;  Müller  et al . 2001 a  ,   b  ;  Le Gall and Saunders 2007 ). As members of the distantly related Compsopogonales (Compsopogonophyceae) are primarily freshwater as well ( Sheath 1984 ;  Müller  et al . 2002 ), it is likely that adaptation to freshwater habitats involved multiple, independent events in the evolution of red algae.  The genus  Batrachospermum  appears to be polyphyletic, comprising many morphologically similar but distantly related taxa (e.g.  Chiasson  et al.  2007 ;  Kapraun  et al.  2007 ). Species of  Batrachospermum ,  Sirodotia  and  Tuomeya  (Batrachospermaceae) investigated in the present study have 2C nuclear DNA contents of about 0.2–0.6 pg, while species of  Lemanea  and  Paralemanea  (Lemaneaceae) have noticeably larger 2C genome sizes of 1.0–1.6 pg [see  Additional Information ]. Results of this study suggest a possible correlation between polyploidy and the expression of the  Batrachospermum  or  Lemanea  morphological phenotypes.  Published karyological studies for Batrachospermaceae indicate that most species have chromosome numbers in the range of 1 n  = 3–5 or 10–12, while Lemaneaceae species have chromosome complements of 1 n  = 15–20 ( Kapraun  et al.  2007 ). Both the larger genome sizes and chromosome complements in  Lemanea  and  Paralemanea  are consistent with polyploidy events in their common ancestry.  A unique pattern of somatic meiosis has been described in members of this order associated with development of haploid gametophytes from vegetative branches of the microscopic, diploid sporophyte phase ( Necchi and Carmona 2002 ). The sporophyte phase has been described variously as ‘ Chantransia ’ ( Chiasson  et al . 2005 ),  Audouinella  ( Necchi and Zucchi 1997 ) and, possibly,  Balliopsis  ( Saunders and Necchi 2002 ). Support for this life history comes from both cytological (von  Stosch and Theil 1979 ;  Necchi 1987 ) and microspectrophotometry ( Sheath  et al . 1994 ,  1996 ) investigations. In the present study, DAPI and microspectrophotometry demonstrated in isolates of three species ( Batrachospermum gelatinosum ,  Batrachospermum vagum  and  Lemanea torulosa )  I  f  (fluorescence) levels in 2C nuclei in presumptive gametophytes that closely approximate 50 % of the 4C values in presumptive sporophytes.  Past molecular systematic investigations resolved the Corallinales as a lineage within the larger group of taxa that share the presence of pit plugs with two cap layers and were classified as the Nemaliophycidae ( Saunders and Bailey 1997 ;  Harper and Saunders 2002 ;  Saunders and Hommersand 2004 ). The recent multigene study of  Le Gall and Saunders (2007)  demonstrated that the Corallinales and Rhodogorgonales represented a separate evolutionary lineage from the Nemaliophycidae, and established the Corallinophycidae. The analyses of  Verbruggen  et al.  (2010)  supported this classification and the inclusion of the Sporolithales in this subclass as suggested by  Le Gall and Saunders (2007) .  Nuclear DNA content data are only available from species in the Corallinales where 2C DNA contents range from 0.1 to 1.3 pg (Fig.  1 ) [see  Additional Information ]. Coralline algae can be divided into two types: geniculate (with alternating calcified internodes and uncalcified nodes) and non-geniculate (which usually grow as crusts) (e.g.  Woelkerling  et al . 1993 ). Recently, molecular studies demonstrated that genicula are non-homologous structures that evolved independently in several families ( Bailey and Chapman 1996 ,  1998 ). When DNA content data are superimposed on this molecular phylogeny, it becomes apparent that geniculate clades are represented by species with larger nuclear genomes (0.6–1.3 pg) while non-geniculate clades contain species with relatively small nuclear genomes (0.1–1.0 pg) ( Kapraun 2005 ). Analysis of additional species will be required to determine whether these observations reflect a sampling artefact.  Ordinal classification within the Rhodymeniophycidae continues to be refined, in large part as a result of distinct evolutionary lineages being recognized within the large, polyphyletic Gigartinales (e.g.  Withall and Saunders 2006 ). The subclass currently includes 12 orders ( Saunders and Hommersand 2004 ;  Guiry and Guiry 2011 ), with DNA content estimates available for species in nine of these (Fig.  1 ). While the overall 2C DNA content range of 0.2–2.8 pg is relatively wide, five of the orders (Gelidiales, Gigartinales, Gracilariales, Halymeniales and Rhodymeniales) have particularly narrow ranges of DNA contents [see  Additional Information ].  The relatively narrow range of small DNA content values but substantial range of chromosome numbers ( Kapraun and Bailey 1989 ;  Freshwater 1993 ;  Kapraun  et al.  1993 b  ,  1994 ), and the absence of a correlation between nuclear genome size and chromosome number suggest a significant role of aneuploidy in Gelidialean evolution ( Kapraun and Dunwoody 2002 ). Analyses of DNA sequence data from a variety of loci have resulted in a consistent molecular phylogeny for the Gelidiales (e.g.  Freshwater and Bailey 1998 ;  Shimada  et al.  1999 ;  Thomas and Freshwater 2001 ;  Tronchin and Freshwater 2007 ). This well-circumscribed order includes only a handful of genera, but is particularly species rich (e.g.  Millar and Freshwater 2005 ), and it would be very interesting to explore the possible role of aneuploidy in their evolution by obtaining additional chromosome and genome size data for representative species.  This order was separated from the Nemaliales on the basis of their then known alternation of generations ( Feldmann and Feldmann 1942 ). It is now known that this life history pattern lacks taxonomic significance as some Nemaliales are heteromorphic and some Bonnemaisoniales are isomorphic ( Womersley 1996 ). For example,  Bonnemaisonia asparagoides  (Woodward) C. Agardh is monoecious and has a direct life history with no tetrasporophyte, while  Bonnemaisonia clavata  G. Hamel is dioecious and has an alternation of heteromorphic generations with ‘ Hymenoclonium serpens ’ representing the tetrasporophyte ( Salvador Soler  et al.  2008 ). The Bonnemaisoniales are currently recognized at the ordinal level on the morphological basis of their apical development pattern and direct development of the gonimoblast. Ultrastructural details of pit plugs and caps ( Pueschel 1989 ) and plastids ( Chihara and Yoshizaki 1972 ), as well as molecular studies (e.g.  Saunders  et al . 2004 ;  Le Gall and Saunders 2007 ), appear to support retention of this order.  In a recent study (N. Salvador Soler, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain, unpubl. res.) and the current study, nuclear DNA content data for ‘ Falkenbergia rufolanosa ’, the diploid sporophyte phase of the heteromorphic species  Asparagopsis armata , and for the isomorphic species  Delisea plumosa  and  Ptilonia willana , suggest 2C values for members of this order of 0.5–0.6 pg. Nuclear DNA content data for both phases of the heteromorphic species in the Bonnemaisoniales are needed to confirm that ploidy level shifts (2 n /4 n ) are associated with the gametophyte and sporophyte phases, respectively.

Dots represent individual DNA content estimates; lines represent the range of values for multiple species.   Estimated 2C nuclear DNA contents superimposed on a phylogeny of  Neosiphonia  and  Polysiphonia  species.  Phylogeny based on the analyses of  Mamoozadeh and Freshwater (2011) .  Recent data suggest that Ceramiales are an ancient lineage relative to other Rhodymeniophycidae (Le  Gall and Saunders 2007 ;  Verbruggen  et al.  2010 ), yet on average they have larger nuclear genome contents than most of the taxa that are believed to have diverged after them. Unless an assumption is made that the other taxa in the Rhodymeniophycidae lineage have experienced nuclear genome size decrease, an explanation is required to account for the larger genome sizes in the Ceramiales.  Although the existence of mechanisms for decreasing DNA amounts have been proposed ( Wendel  et al . 2002 ), it is more probable that polyploidy and transposable element amplification will result in genome size increase through time ( Bennetzen 2002 ), ultimately resulting in genomic ‘obesity’ ( Bennetzen and Kellogg 1997 ). Since the Ceramiales are arguably the oldest members of the Rhodymeniophycidae lineage, they would have accumulated the largest genomes and may have been subject to a predictable genomic expansion. Although data are severely limited, there appears to be a correlation between antiquity of these red algal lineages and their mean nuclear DNA contents.  The Gigartinales is a large and diverse order ( Fredericq  et al . 1996 ;  Hommersand  et al . 1999 ;  Tai  et al . 2001 ;  Saunders  et al . 2004 ) including commercially important carrageenophytes such as  Eucheuma ,  Kappaphycus  and  Chondrus  ( Craigie 1990 ;  Kapraun 1999 ). Present results confirm previous studies ( Kapraun  et al . 1992 ;  López-Bautista and Kapraun 1995 ;  Kapraun and López-Bautista 1997 ), suggesting that members of this order are characterized by a wide range of chromosome numbers (2 n  = 10–70) and a narrow range of small nuclear DNA contents (2C = 0.2–0.9 pg) [see  Additional Information ]. The genome size (1C) of  Chondrus crispus  was estimated as 150 Mbp using flow cytometry of haploid nuclei ( Le Gall  et al . 1993 ), but recent complete sequencing of this genome indicates a size of only 105 Mbp ( Collén 2011 ) concordant with previous estimates using static microspectrophotometry ( Kapraun 2005 ). This relatively small size and the species' economic importance made  Chondrus  an ideal candidate among carrageenophytes for genome sequencing.  The Halymeniales is a relatively large order of 270+ species classified in 26 currently recognized genera ( Guiry and Guiry 2011 ). Currently, 2C DNA content data are only available for two species,  Grateloupia filicina  (Lamouroux) C. Agardh and  Halymenia floridana  J. Agardh, with both having identical values (Fig.  1 ) [see  Additional Information ].  Recent studies have reinstated the Nemastomatales and established the Sebdeniales for species previously part of the Gigartinales ( Saunders and Kraft 2002 ;  Withall and Saunders 2006 ). Although the orders are represented by relatively few species, molecular and morphological analyses reveal additional diversity (e.g.  Schneider  et al.  2006 ). Currently, estimates of 2C DNA content are only available for two  Predaea  (Nemastomatales) and one  Sebdenia  (Sebdeniales) species (Fig.  1 ) [see  Additional Information ].  This order includes relatively few genera, but some of them, e.g.,  Gracilaria , are species rich ( Fredericq and Hommersand 1990 ). No new nuclear DNA content estimates are available for this order, but previous data indicate that nuclear genome sizes are small (0.3–0.5 pg) ( Kapraun 1993 b  ,  2005 ). The Gracilariales, unlike the Gelidiales, is noted for genome size constancy, with all species of  Gracilaria  investigated having identical 2C DNA contents of 0.4 pg and chromosome complements of 2 n  = 48 ( Kapraun and Dutcher 1991 ;  Kapraun 1993 a  ). Species of the closely related  Gracilariopsis  ( Bird  et al . 1994 ;  Bellorin  et al . 2002 ;  Gurgel  et al . 2003 ) exhibit some variation in both 2C DNA contents (0.3–0.5 pg) and 2 n  chromosome complements with values of 2 n  = 48 and 64 reported.  Nuclear DNA content estimates from previous ( Kapraun 2005 ) and present studies are now available for nine species representing three families of the Rhodymeniales ( Saunders  et al . 1999 ) [see  Additional Information ]. This order, along with the Gelidiales and Gracilariales, has both a narrow range and a small mean nuclear genome size (2C = 0.3–0.6 pg).  The size of the red algal genomes reported here and previously ( Kapraun 2005 ) is best appreciated when compared with the minimum amount of DNA estimated for specifying the mRNA sequences required for angiosperm development. Specifically, the genomes of  Genlisea margaretae  Hutchinson and  Arabidopsis thaliana  (L.) Heynhold, with 2C = 126 and 314 Mb, respectively, ( Riechmann  et al . 2000 ;  Bennett  et al.  2003 ;  Greilhuber  et al . 2006 ), are among the smallest found in angiosperms ( Bennett and Smith 1976 ), but still have 1.5–2 times the estimated 15 000 genes per haploid genome required for development ( Flavell, 1980 ). Similarly, the genome of the green alga  Volvox carteri  F. Stein, with 138 Mbp, has an estimated coding potential for 14 500 proteins ( Prochnik  et al . 2010 ). Even the smallest rhodophyte genome reported (e.g. 1C = 98 Mb in  Compsopogon coerulus ), with its probable genomic redundancy ( Kapraun 2005 ,  2007 ), has the genic capacity for morphologically complex development.   Comparison of 4C nuclear DNA contents and 2 n  chromosome complements for 33 species of Florideophyceae.  DNA content values from the present study and previously published data ( Kapraun 2005 ;  Kapraun  et al.  2007 ;  Salvador Soler  et al.  2009 ), and 2 n  chromosome complements from  Cole (1990)  and  Kapraun (2005) .  Although no correlation is apparent between phylogenetic placement and genome size, groups considered to be basal (Cyanidiophytina, Porphyridiophyceae, Stylonematophyceae, Compsopogonophyceae, Rhodellophyceae) generally have genome sizes ≤0.5 pg, while derived groups (Bangiophyceae, Florideophyceae) generally have genome sizes ≥0.5 pg, with values up to 2.8 pg reported. DNA contents may be diagnostic, synapomorphies in both the Corallinales and Batrachospermales. In the Corallinales ( Kapraun 2005 ), geniculate clades are represented by species with larger nuclear genomes (0.6–1.3 pg) while non-geniculate clades contain species with relatively small nuclear genomes (0.1–1.0 pg), the overlap in these ranges is a result of single outlier species. Similarly, in the Batrachospermales, species of  Batrachospermum ,  Sirodotia  and  Tuomeya  have 2C nuclear DNA contents of 0.2–0.6 pg while species of  Lemanea  and  Paralemanea  have noticeably larger 2C genome sizes of 1.0–1.6 pg ( Kapraun  et al . 2007 ) [see  Additional Information ]. More definitive trends may be revealed as data for nuclear genome size and our understanding of red algal evolutionary relationships increase.  It is likely that adaptation to freshwater habitats involved multiple, independent events in the evolution of red algae. In the present study, no correlation between nuclear genome size and adaptation to freshwater habitats is apparent in the Compsopogonales, Thoreales and Batrachospermales.  In a previous investigation of the relationship of nuclear genome size to reproductive cell parameters in the Rhodophyta ( Kapraun and Dunwoody 2002 ), three general trends regarding carpospore production were noted: (i) increase in genome size was positively correlated with increase in carpospore volume; (ii) species with larger genome sizes produced fewer carpospores; and (iii) species that produced larger carpospores produce fewer carpospores. Members of the Ceramiales, with their larger genome sizes, typically produce fewer, but larger carpospores and generally behave as predicted in a  K -selection model. In contrast, members of the Gelidiales, Gigartinales and Gracilariales, with their smaller genome sizes, typically produce large numbers of small carpospores as predicted in an  r -selected model ( Kapraun and Dunwoody 2002 ). The conspicuous limitation of this ecological model is that the Ceramiales generally produce small, structurally simple, short-lived plants (associated with  r -selection), while the other orders generally produce large, structurally complex, long-lived plants (associated with  K -selection).  In the present study, cyanidophytes represent the earliest diverging red algal lineage and have reported genome sizes of 1C = 0.02–0.1 pg (1C = 10–55 Mbp) and 2 n  chromosome numbers between 4 and 20 [see  Additional Information ]. These genomic characteristics recommend this group for further investigations that could possibly help characterize the nuclear genome in unicellular organisms prior to the transition to multicellularity seen in other red algae. Among the basal Rhodophytina, members of the Compsopogonophyceae, Porphyridiophyceae and Stylonematophyceae may represent appropriate candidates for investigations of nuclear genomes in extant, basal red algae. For example,  Compsopogon caeruleus  has a 2C DNA content of 0.25 pg (1C = 98 Mb) and a reported chromosome complement of 1 n  = 7 ± 1 ( Nichols 1964 ). Small genome size and chromosome complements have been reported in  Porphyridium aerugineum  Geitler ( n  = 2) and  P. purpureum  (Bory de Saint-Vincent) K.M. Drew &amp; R. Ross [as  P. cruentum  (S.F. Gray) Nägeli] ( n  = 2; 2C DNA content = 0.1 pg) ( Sommerfeld and Nichols 1970 ), although it remains unclear whether these represent haploid or diploid values.  DNA C-value remains a key character in biology, biodiversity and molecular investigations as genome size has many important practical implications ( Bennett  et al . 2000 ). Genome size directly influences the cost and difficulty of sequencing projects, and was a primary consideration in choosing subjects for early whole-genome analyses ( Gregory 2001 ,  2005 ), including those of algae where small DNA content (haploid genomes ∼100 Mbp) has been a major criterion ( Peters  et al . 2004 ;  Waaland  et al . 2004 ). Despite major improvements in sequencing cost and efficiency provided by current next-generation sequencing technology, genome size is still a consideration for coverage and  de novo  assembly. Many red algal species have haploid genomes in the range of 127–300 Mbp [see  Additional Information ], and the present study provides a list of target species with small genome sizes for whole-genome sequencing studies. Many of these species (e.g. Gelidiales and Gracilariales) are also amenable to culture and are of significant ecological and/or commercial importance ( López-Bautista and Kapraun 1995 ;  Kapraun and López-Bautista 1997 ;  Kapraun 1999 ).  Early diverging red algal lineages are characterized by relatively small 2C DNA contents while a wide range of 2C values is found within the derived Florideophyceae. An overall correlation between phylogenetic placement and 2C DNA content is not apparent; however, genome size data are available for only a small portion of red algae. Current data do support polyploidy and aneuploidy as pervasive features of red algal genome evolution.  Red algae that warrant further investigation include the Nemaliales, Acrochaetiales and Colaconematales. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that these three orders are part of early diverging florideophycean lineages (e.g.  Le Gall and Saunders 2007 ), are widely distributed and contain many genera that are species rich ( Saunders  et al . 1995 ;  Harper and Saunders 1998 ), yet published information about their genome sizes is very limited. It would be of interest to determine whether the relatively wide range of DNA contents found in the Nemaliales occurs in these other related orders.  Another group of red algae that warrant attention is the Ceramiales, especially the Rhodomelaceae, which may include more species than all other red algae combined. Continuing molecular phylogenetic investigations provide us with evolutionary schemes (e.g.  Martin-Lescanne  et al.  2010 ;  Mamoozadeh and Freshwater 2011 ) upon which genome size data can be superimposed to reveal the extent that speciation was accompanied by nuclear transformations.
