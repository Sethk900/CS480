A review of the Neotropical genus Drepanocnemis Stein (Diptera, Muscidae), with phylogenetic analysis and biogeographic considerations of its speciesDrepanocnemis Stein (Diptera, Muscidae) includes three species until now only recorded from Peru and Bolivia, basically known only from their typeâ€material and original descriptions. This review is based on the analysis of the typeâ€material of D. griseovirens Malloch and D. hirticeps Stein and two specimens from Ecuador collected more recently. A key, and illustrations of head, tibia and terminalia (male and female) make easier the identification of the species. The phylogenetic analysis resulted in a cladogram where the monophyly of Drepanocnemis was supported by three characters: disposition of katepisternal setae in male 0:1, male fore tibia very broad and with one long anterodorsal seta. The cladogram of Drepanocnemis species was superimposed with its geographical distribution on a map of South America. The pattern of the distribution of the species was compared and discussed with historical biogeographic areas previously indicated in literature.
