Systematics and ecology of Oligodon sublineatus Duméril, Bibron &amp; Duméril, 1854, an endemic snake of Sri Lanka, including the designation of a lectotypeThe description of Oligodon sublineatus Duméril, Bibron & Duméril, 1854 was based on two syntypes located at Paris Natural History Museum (MNHN). The larger specimen (SVL 254 mm) was described in detail, but erroneously labelled as originating from the Philippines, the second specimen (SVL 150 mm) was labelled as originating from ‘Ceylan’ (=Sri Lanka). The smaller specimen, up to this point, has always been considered as the holotype by monotypy. Since recognising the larger specimen in the collection of MNHN as a syntype, we hereby designate it as the lectotype of Oligodon sublineatus and redescribe comprehensively both syntypes. Oligodon sublineatus (SVL 152–310 mm) has 130–161 ventral scales, 23–42 divided subcaudals, a divided anal plate, a loreal, seven supralabials, and 1+2 temporals. Furthermore, we provide a detailed account of the distribution and natural history of this widely distributed Sri Lankan endemic snake.
