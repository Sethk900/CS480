On the morphology and geographical distribution of some problematic South Palearctic Cyclops (Copepoda: Cyclopidae)Females and males of two South Palearctic Cyclops, C. ankyrae Mann, 1940 and C. abyssorum divergens Lindberg, 1936 are redescribed, and their taxonomic relationships are discussed. Cyclops ankyrae can be distinguished from congeners by the spine formula of the terminal exopodal segments (2433), distinct anal operculum, bare proctodeum, presence of a longitudinal row of large spinules near the palp on the frontal surface of the mandibular coxopodite, spinule ornamentation of the maxilliped coxopodite, presence of hairs on the caudal surface of P3â€“P4 couplers, and lack of large spinules on the frontal surface of the P1 basipodite. Cyclops abyssorum divergens differs from C. abyssorum s. str. in the relatively short inner median caudal seta, reduced spinule ornamentation on the caudal surface of P4 coxopodite, and presence of large spinules on the maxillular palp. Cyclops singularis Einsle, 1996 is synonymized here with C. a. divergens Lindberg, 1936. The geographic distribution of C. a. divergens is revised.
