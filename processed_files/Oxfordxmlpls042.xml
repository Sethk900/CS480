This review provides the first up-to-date perspective and detailed analysis of wheat research in Bangladesh and the impact that global warming will have on its agriculture, especially wheat farming.The most fundamental activity of the people of Bangladesh is agriculture. Modelling projections for Bangladesh indicate that warmer temperatures linked to climate change will severely reduce the growth of various winter crops (wheat, boro rice, potato and winter vegetables) in the north and central parts. In summer, crops in south-eastern parts of the country are at risk from increased flooding as sea levels increase.Wheat is one of the most important winter crops and is temperature sensitive and the second most important grain crop after rice. In this review, we provide an up-to-date and detailed account of wheat research of Bangladesh and the impact that global warming may have on agriculture, especially wheat production. Although flooding is not of major importance or consequence to the wheat crop at present, some perspectives are provided on this stress since wheat is flood sensitive and the incidence of flooding is likely to increase.This information and projections will allow wheat breeders to devise new breeding programmes to attempt to mitigate future global warming. We discuss what this implies for food security in the broader context of South Asia.<bold>Yearly import (1000 MT) and growth rate (%) of wheat from 1971 to 2011 in Bangladesh.</bold> Growth rate (%) was calculated relative to the previous year's value (data source: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C62">Index Mundi 2012<italic>b</italic></xref>).<bold>Domestic consumption (1000 MT) and growth rate (%) of wheat from 1960 to 2011 in Bangladesh.</bold> Growth rate (%) was calculated relative to the previous year's value (data source: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C62">Index Mundi 2012<italic>b</italic></xref>).<bold>Yearly production (1000 MT) and growth rate (%) of wheat from 1960 to 2011 in Bangladesh.</bold> Growth rate (%) was calculated relative to the previous year's value (data source: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C62">Index Mundi 2012<italic>b</italic></xref>).<bold>Area cultivated (1000 ha) and growth rate (%) of wheat from 1960 to 2011 in Bangladesh.</bold> Growth rate (%) was calculated relative to the previous year's value (data source: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C62">Index Mundi 2012<italic>b</italic></xref>).Characteristics of existing wheat varieties of Bangladesh developed since 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C16">BARI 2012<italic>a</italic></xref>).<bold>Year of release and average yield (tons ha<sup>−1</sup>) of Bangladesh wheat varieties developed since 1974 up until 2012</bold>.

However, the release of ‘Sonalika’ in 1972 created a true breakthrough in wheat production. This fast maturing and high-yielding variety (yield = 2 tons ha<sup>−1</sup>) became very popular among wheat growers and adapted well to different production environments, and was adopted in 80 % of the wheat area by the early 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C135">WRC 2009</xref>). In 1983, the Wheat Research Centre (WRC), Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI), released four more high-yielding (yield = 2–3 tons ha<sup>−1</sup>) varieties (‘Ananda’, ‘Kanchan’, ‘Barkat’ and ‘Akbar’). Among these, ‘Kanchan’ proved particularly adaptable and gradually replaced ‘Sonalika’ to become the predominant variety in Bangladesh by the early 1990s. Two other high-yielding varieties, ‘Aghrani’ and ‘Protiva’, were recommended by the Bangladesh National Seed Board in 1987 and 1993, respectively. These varieties were more responsive to a wider range of weather conditions as well as crop management practices such as fertilizers, irrigation and intercultural operations. Therefore, by the mid-1990s, adoption of high-yielding varieties was almost 100 %, thereby increasing wheat productivity substantially. The year of release and average yield of the new wheat varieties developed in Bangladesh from 1974 to 2012 are presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS042F5">5</xref>.However, breeding efforts to develop high-yielding varieties still continued. Several more high-yielding varieties were developed. These included ‘BARI Gom 19’ (‘Sourav’) and ‘BARI Gom 20’ (‘Gourab’) released in 1998; ‘BARI Gom 21’ (‘Shatabdi’) in 2000; ‘BARI Gom 22’ (‘Sufi’), ‘BARI Gom 23’ (‘Bijoy’) and ‘BARI Gom 24’ (‘Prodip’) in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C97">Pandit <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>); and ‘BARI Gom 25’ and ‘BARI Gom 26’ released in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C17">BARI 2012<italic>b</italic></xref>). In 2012, two more varieties, ‘BARI Gom 27’ and ‘BARI Gom 28’, were released. Some general characteristics of the existing elite wheat varieties of Bangladesh are presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLS042TB1">1</xref>. Thanks largely to the new varieties, total production increased between 1970 and 2002, but thereafter production decreased as the production area also fell (based on 52 years of data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C62">Index Mundi (2012<italic>b</italic>)</xref>; Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS042F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS042F5">5</xref>). The decrease in area was due to competition from other rabi-grown crops such as boro rice, potato and maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C135">WRC 2009</xref>), even though the yield of existing wheat varieties increased through intensive research (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLS042TB1">1</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS042F5">5</xref>).The CIMMYT has worked closely with the Bangladesh wheat programmes and has played a vital role in popularizing wheat cultivation in Bangladesh from the start. The CIMMYT provided an enormous elite wheat germplasm from which promising types could be selected to suit the Bangladesh environment. Many wheat scientists attended in-service training at CIMMYT on issues such as wheat improvement, production agronomy, wheat quality and station management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C97">Pandit <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). Some Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC) personnel were also trained on seed production by CIMMYT. Such training programmes were initiated in 1969 and still continue. The CIMMYT wheat scientists visit research stations and farmers' fields. This collaboration was a key factor in quickly turning Bangladesh into a wheat-growing country. In addition to collaboration with CIMMYT, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), Australian Government Overseas Aid Program (Aus-AID), United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Ford Foundation provided grants for facility improvement and manpower development of the WRC, BARI, in Bangladesh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C97">Pandit <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>).Global and regional wheat production and consumption statistics in wheat-producing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C36">FAOSTAT 2012</xref>).The CIMMYT has recently examined the potential impact of climate change on wheat production. For the purposes of crop technology development, CIMMYT classifies world production in terms of ‘mega-environments’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C23">(Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) 2009)</xref>. These are broad, often non-contiguous or even transcontinental areas showing similar crop production conditions. Focusing on South Asia's Indo-Gangetic Plain, which produces ∼90 million tons of wheat grain year<sup>−1</sup> (or nearly 15 % of total production worldwide), CIMMYT researchers examined how climate change might affect the current classification of two wheat mega-environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C23">CGIAR 2009</xref>). While both are irrigated, one is favourable for wheat production, while the other is not because of heat stress early and late in the growing season. Under the climatic conditions expected to prevail by 2050, researchers project that the favourable wheat mega-environment will shrink by just over half, mainly because of increased heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C23">CGIAR 2009</xref>). This will most probably lead to a major reduction in wheat harvests, threatening the food security of ∼200 million people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C23">CGIAR 2009</xref>).Regarding agriculture and food security overall, crop yields of wheat, maize and rice are predicted to decrease in South Asia by up to 30 % by the end of this century (compared with an increase of up to 20 % in East and South East Asia) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C11">Anonymous 2012</xref>). In cereal production alone, the most conservative climate change projections suggest a minimum decline across South Asia of between 4 and 10 %. In Bangladesh, rice production could fall by 8 % and wheat production by 32 % as early as 2050 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C11">Anonymous 2012</xref>). Substantial losses in rain-fed wheat are also anticipated. Studies in India suggest that a 0.5 °C rise in winter temperature would reduce wheat yield by 0.45 tons ha<sup>−1</sup>. Similarly, a rise in temperature beyond 2.5 °C would reduce non-irrigated wheat and rice farm revenue by 9–25 % (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C11">Anonymous 2012</xref>).In response to the predicted problems for wheat production summarized above, researchers in numerous countries are trying to develop heat-tolerant wheat varieties or improve management practices to mitigate the effects of future global warming. Representative research findings related to high temperature, drought stress and their effect on different wheat cultivars in different countries around the world are presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLS042TB4">4</xref>.General circulation model estimates of temperature and precipitation changes (source: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C94">OECD 2003</xref>).Figures in parenthesis indicate standard deviation.DJE, December, January and February; JJA, June, July and August.Bangladesh is a deltaic land of ∼144 000 km<sup>2</sup> bordered by the Himalayas to the north and the Bay of Bengal to the south. Its South Asian position extends from 20°45′N to 26°40′N and from 88°05′E to 92°40′E. Fifty per cent of the country's land elevation is within 5 m of sea level. About 68 % of the country is vulnerable to flooding while 20–25 % of the area is inundated during normal flooding. It has a complex coastline of ∼710 km and a long continental shelf with a shallow bathymetry. The Bay of Bengal forms a funnel shape towards the Meghna estuary. Because of this, its storm surge is the highest in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C64">A. S. Islam 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C65">C. M. A. Islam 2009</xref>). Water-stressed wheat, in response to flooding, suffers considerable changes in its metabolic profile, particularly proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C91">Noorka and Teixeira da Silva 2012</xref>). Flooding can therefore alter the nutritional profile of this crop.Existing vulnerability to flooding, caused by upstream deforestation, will be aggravated by the effects of climate change. Climate change is anticipated to bring increased sedimentation and an increase in extreme rainfall events, both of which will increase flood risk beyond its current high levels, as witnessed by Cyclone Sidr in 2007, the most devastating cyclone to have struck Bangladesh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C41">Haq <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). All coastal areas in Asia are currently facing increasing stress with threats to human and environmental resilience. However, rising sea levels will have a further, major impact on coastal and low-lying communities in South Asia. The most conservative climate change scenarios predict a rise in sea level of 40 cm by the end of this century, which will increase the annual number of people affected by flooding in Asia from 12 million to 94 million, with almost 60 % of these people living in South Asia (including the coastlines of Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh). Modelling suggests that 1 million people will be directly affected by a rise in sea level in 2050 in the region of the Bangladesh Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna mega-delta. Moreover, Bangladesh's coastal areas will continue to suffer from saline water intrusion, coastal land degradation, storm surges and drainage congestion due to high water flow and sedimentation in the flood plain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C101">Rahman 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C100">Practical Action 2012</xref>).Major basic food in the Bangladeshi diet comprises rice, wheat, pulses, potato, vegetables and fish. These foods contribute almost 85 % of the total calorie and protein intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C19">Begum and Luc D'Haese 2010</xref>). Rice and wheat alone contribute 71 and 53 % of the total per capita calorie and protein intake, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C9">Anonymous 2008</xref>). It was projected that in the years up to 2021, annual demand for food exceeds supply. The shortfall was −0.28 % for rice and −1.76 % for wheat. This implies that demand is greater than supply for both crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C19">Begum and Luc D'Haese 2010</xref>).Pressure for increased crop production is generated mostly by rapid population growth. This constitutes a most serious challenge to political and social strategists. Agriculture is also a major employer (44 % of the total workforce) and contributes ∼12 % of Bangladesh's GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C67">IUCN 2012</xref>). For these reasons, the government has given topmost priority to the agriculture sector. This is directly related to the relief of rural poverty since agriculture benefits the livelihood of rural poor people who account for the majority of the population. The agriculture sector is therefore the primary income contributor and employment generator in Bangladesh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C98">Planning Commission 2009</xref>). Between 2000 and 2005, the prevalence of poverty in Bangladesh diminished from 49 % to 40 % (56 million). However, by mid-2008, an additional 8.5 % (i.e. 12 million) were feared to have slid below the poverty line due to rises in food prices in the world market. The prevalence of poverty is now ∼48.5 %, as reported by the CPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C29">Centre for Policy Dialogue 2012</xref>). Bangladesh is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world. Located between the Himalayas and the Bay of Bengal, the country is very prone to natural disasters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C134">World Bank 2009</xref>). Climate change accelerates the intensity and frequency of these through increasing salinity, storms, drought, irregular rainfall, high temperature, flash floods, etc., which are presumed to be the results of global warming.Every crop has an optimal temperature range for vegetative and reproductive growth. When the temperature falls below this range or exceeds the upper limit, then that crop production faces constraints. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C66">Islam <italic>et al</italic>. (2008)</xref> found that a 10 °C increase in maximum temperature at vegetative, reproductive and ripening stages caused a decrease in aman rice production by 2.94, 53.06 and 17.28 tons, respectively. With a change in average temperature of 2–4 °C, the prospect of growing wheat and potato would be severely impaired and production loss may exceed 60 % of the achievable yields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C76">Karim 1993</xref>). On the other hand, the response of soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition to increasing temperature is a critical aspect of an ecosystem's responses to global change. The temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition is a key factor determining the response of the terrestrial carbon balance to climatic change, as most recently shown in coupled global carbon climate–vegetation model studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C68">Jones <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>). Consequently, the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration and SOM decomposition has received much attention (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C86">Luo <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C108">Reichstein <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C117">Sandermann <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C83">Leite and Madari 2011</xref>).An increase in winter temperature can reduce the environmental suitability for wheat, potato and other temperate crops grown in rabi in the north and central parts of the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C64">A. S. Islam 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C65">C. M. A. Islam 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C21">Braun <italic>et al</italic>. (2010)</xref> reported that while accounting for a fifth of human food consumption, wheat is second only to rice as a source of calories in developing countries such as Bangladesh, and is first as a source of protein. With over 35 % of Bangladeshis suffering from malnourishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C82">Lal <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>), the threat of increased hunger from a reduction in agricultural production would suggest agriculture as one of the major vulnerabilities facing the country.Climate change is already thought to be increasing the incidence and intensity of droughts: there were only five devastating droughts in the 100 years from 1800 to 1900, yet, since 1981, four major droughts have occurred in the last 25 years, mostly in north-western Bangladesh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C119">Selvaraju <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>). The area affected is also expected to grow. For example, the area severely affected by rabi droughts could increase from 4000 to 12 000 km as global warming increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C59">Huq 2006</xref>). Devastating and regular droughts caused by a lack or a late/early arrival of rainfall are common in many parts of Bangladesh. The impact of drought, associated with late or premature monsoon rains or even complete failure of monsoon, spreads over a much larger geographical area than areas affected by other natural hazards. Bangladesh experienced major droughts in 1973, 1978–79, 1981–82, 1989, 1992 and 1994–95. Food grain production lost in the 1978–79 drought was probably 50–100 % more than that lost in the great flood of 1974, directly affecting 42 % of cultivated land. This shows that drought can be as devastating as major floods or cyclones. Rice, jute and other crops were greatly affected, and livestock also suffered from the severe water shortage. More recently, the droughts of 1994–95 in the north-western districts of Bangladesh led to a 3.5-million-ton shortfall of rice and wheat production, while the 1997 drought caused an ∼1-million-ton shortfall of food grain, of which ∼0.6 million tons was transplanted with aman rice valued at around US$500 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C119">Selvaraju <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>).Bangladesh ranks sixth among the countries in the world most vulnerable to floods. Owing to its topography and position, the country is experiencing flooding in 30–50 % of the area and almost every year. These extreme weather events cause heavy losses to agricultural production, particularly to broad acre crops. Flooding has become severe in the past 4–5 years with severe flooding inundating roughly 60 % of the country. The effect was especially severe on crop agriculture and thus on the livelihood of most Bangladeshi people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C101">Rahman 2011</xref>). The reductions in yields of staple crops such as rice and wheat caused by flooding are anticipated to be very great. By 2050, rice yield could drop by 8 % and wheat yields by 32 % (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C100">Practical Action 2012</xref>). Beyond these values and predictions, there are no further statistics to help manage wheat cropping under flooded conditions. Furthermore, no flooding-tolerant varieties have yet been developed by Bangladeshi scientists, although a start has been made recently. Less attention is given to the effect of flooding on wheat compared with rice since wheat is cultivated mostly in the highlands in the north.Recent studies related to heat, drought and low-temperature stress in different countries around the world (chronological order).Research findings related to the effect of temperature on wheat (<italic>T. aestivum</italic> L.) of Bangladesh studied by different scientists.Research related to membrane thermostability, heat susceptibility, relative performance and stress stability study to identify heat-tolerant cultivars.Problems of salinity and water logging, heavy erosion of soils and riverbanks all accelerate soil degradation. Estimates of areas affected by nutrient depletion and other forms of soil degradation are ∼5.6 million ha in Bangladesh with ∼0.83 million ha of land being affected by various degrees of salinity. With climate change, saline water may extend to currently non-saline land, ultimately affecting (negatively) crop production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C101">Rahman 2011</xref>). The Bangladeshi Ministry of Agriculture has also initiated a number of agricultural programmes, such as the development and distribution of drought- and saline-resistant crop varieties to enhance year-round production. Several projects are focused on improving the infrastructural facilities for varietal development to combat these impacts of climate change. For example, the Wheat Research Centre in Bangladesh has so far released 28 wheat varieties. Of these, BARI Gom 23 (‘Bijoy’) and BARI Gom 24 (‘Prodip’) released in 2005, BARI Gom 25 and BARI Gom 26 released in 2010, and BARI Gom 27 and BARI Gom 28 released in 2012 are recommended for commercial cultivation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS042F5">5</xref>). All these varieties are high yielding and heat tolerant, resistant to leaf rust and tolerant of bipolaris leaf blight. Of these varieties, BARI Gom 25 tolerates a moderate level of salinity while BARI Gom 26 and BARI Gom 27 are moderately resistant to the Ug99 race of stem rust. Moreover, BARI Gom 28 matures very early and is highly tolerant of terminal heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C17">BARI 2012<italic>b</italic></xref>). The major stress faced by wheat in South Asia is high temperature, mainly terminal heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C72">Joshi <italic>et al</italic>. 2007<italic>a</italic></xref>), which was defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C38">Fischer and Byerlee (1991)</xref>, due to mean daily temperature above 17.5 °C in the coolest month. Both the proximity to the equator and popular cropping systems, which involve the late sowing of wheat, are the major causes of exposure of wheat in Bangladesh and other neighbouring countries to high temperatures during grain filling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C104">Rane <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>). Therefore, breeding for high-temperature tolerance in wheat is another major objective of wheat improvement programmes in South Asian countries, including Bangladesh, India and Nepal. Besides the development of varieties and production initiatives, CIMMYT and WRC will strengthen their breeder seed production capacity in the next 5 years to meet the increased demand of climate-vulnerable areas.The two major characteristics of the eastern part of South Asia are high temperatures and humidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C74">Joshi <italic>et al</italic>. 2007<italic>c</italic></xref>). This leads to two important stresses: heat, and spot blotch disease caused by <italic>Bipolaris sorokiniana</italic> (Sacc.) shoem syn. <italic>Drechslera sorokiniana</italic> (Sacc.) Subrm and Jain (syn. <italic>Helminthosporium sativum</italic>, teleomorph <italic>Cochliobolus sativus</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C70">Joshi <italic>et al</italic>. 2004<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C71"><italic>b</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C96">Pandey <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C87">Malaker and Reza 2011</xref>). <italic>Septoria</italic> leaf blotch can also severely damage yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C90">Mbarek and Teixeira da Silva 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C113">Saari (1998)</xref> reported that the average yield losses due to leaf blight in the Indian subcontinent were as much as 17.5 %. It is generally believed that the level of resistance in high-yielding wheat genotypes is still unsatisfactory and needs to be improved significantly in warmer humid regions of South Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C72">Joshi <italic>et al</italic>. 2007<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C73"><italic>b</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C74"><italic>c</italic></xref>). Consequently, an integrated approach, with host resistance as a major component, is generally considered best for controlling the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C69">Joshi and Chand 2002</xref>). In this context, CIMMYT is working with different research institutes in South Asia to develop cultivars that are suitable for these regions.In Bangladesh, mean temperature in winter (rabi) has risen by 0.66 °C since 1990 and a further warming of 2.13 °C by 2050 is predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C99">Poulton and Rawson 2011</xref>). A rise in temperature can be expected to increase the severity of <italic>Bipolaris</italic> leaf blight and other wheat diseases in the future because a warm and humid climate favours the development and spread of the pathogen. Changes in the virulence pattern of this pathogen rendering increased susceptibility of wheat varieties are also not unlikely. Increasing temperature might also favour the development and adaptation of wheat stem rust, which can tolerate higher temperatures than other rusts. Although it has not been critically investigated or ascertained, a global rise in temperature could promote mutation and the development of new virulent races of rust pathogens.Postulated rust resistance genes in the released wheat varieties of Bangladesh (source: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C87">Malaker and Reza 2011)</xref>.R, resistant; APR, adult plant resistance.<sup>a</sup>Resistant to all Indian pathotypes of stem rust.<sup>b</sup>Genes were not postulated.<sup>c</sup>Leaf tip necrosis gene <italic>Lr34</italic>.<sup>d</sup>Rust resistance genes present in these two varieties have not yet been identified (may have been detected in the source countries, but we do not have the information); presence of <italic>Sr2</italic> (adult plant slow rusting stem rust resistance gene) in BARI Gom 27 is to be confirmed.The danger posed by the Ug99 strain of stem rust to global wheat production is widely recognized, including in Bangladesh. The release, in 2010, of the first Ug99-resistant wheat variety (BARI Gom 26—previously known as BAW, and popularly called Hashi) was a major step to countering the threat of this disease in Bangladesh. Subsequently, the variety Francolin (also known as BARI Gom 27 or BAW 1120) was released in March 2012. Originating from CIMMYT-Mexico, Francolin possesses good resistance to all variants of Ug99 along with impressive agronomic performance, yielding ∼10 % more than the most popular variety Shatabdi in 3 years of multi-location testing in Bangladesh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C28">CIMMYT 2012</xref>).About 80 % of people in Bangladesh depend directly on agriculture for their food and livelihood, with wheat being the second most important crop after rice. However, climate change leading to global warming has already produced a radical change in temperature regimes in Bangladesh. This will impact strongly on wheat production. The present review provides the first up-to-date perspective and detailed analysis of wheat research in Bangladesh, and the impact that global warming will have on its agriculture, especially wheat farming. This will allow wheat breeders to plan to mitigate the effects of further global warming. This will have direct implications for food security in Bangladesh as well as South Asia. The development of stress-tolerant wheat within the wider context of a breeding programme, particularly with respect to drought and flooding, needs to be supported by <italic>in vitro</italic> protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C37">Farshadfar <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>) as well as molecular techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C24">Chaabane <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C32">Diab <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>), while genetic modification of crops to increase photosynthesis or metabolomics needs greater focus in wheat improvement programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C80">Kershanskaya and Teixeira da Silva 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C111">Ruan and Teixeira da Silva 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS042C112">Ruan <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>).Both authors have contributed equally to this manuscript.None declared.We thank all the employees of the Wheat Research Center, Bangladesh, especially Dr. P.
