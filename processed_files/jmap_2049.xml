Ecophysiological controls over the net ecosystem exchange of mountain spruce stand. Comparison of the response in direct vs. diffuse solar radiation.Cloud cover increases the proportion of diffuse radiation reaching the Earth's surface and affects many microclimatic factors such as temperature, vapour pressure deficit and precipitation. We compared the relative efficiencies of canopy photosynthesis to diffuse and direct photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) for a Norway spruce forest (25-year-old, leaf area index 11 m<sup>2</sup> m<sup>-;2</sup>) during two successive 7-day periods in August. The comparison was based on the response of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO<sub>2</sub> to PPFD. NEE and stomatal conductance at the canopy level (<em>G</em><sub>canopy</sub>) was estimated from half-hourly eddy-covariance measurements of CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O fluxes. In addition, daily courses of CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate (<em>A</em><sub>N</sub>) and stomatal conductance (<em>G</em><sub>s</sub>) at shoot level were measured using a gas-exchange technique applied to branches of trees. The extent of spectral changes in incident solar radiation was assessed using a spectroradiometer.
