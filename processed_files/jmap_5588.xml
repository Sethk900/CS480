Trophic level of fishes caught by trawls in Thracian SeaDiscarding practices of bottom trawlers were studied seasonally in the Thracian Sea from autumn 1996 to May 1998. Sampling was conducted following normal, commercial fishing practices. Overall, 114 hauls were performed at depths ranging from 19 to 356 m. In total, 141 fish species, belonging to 53 families, were caught. Of those, 17 were exclusively marketable, 58 discarded, and 66 species had individuals in both the marketable and discarded fractions. The mean trophic level increased with depth, both for the discarded and marketable catches. In addition, the mean weighted trophic level of the discarded fishes was significantly lower (P<0.05) than that of the marketable ones by approximately 0.5–0.6 trophic level units. This might indicate that trawling in the north Aegean removes species of higher trophic level from the ecosystem, thus contributing to fishing down.
