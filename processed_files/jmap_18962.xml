Earthworm invasion, fine-root distributions, and soil respiration in North temperate forestsThe efflux of carbon from soils is a critical link between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. Current concerns about rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO,) concentrations highlight the need to better understand the dynamics of total soil respiration (TSR, sum of root and heterotroph respiration) in changing environments. We investigated the effects of exotic earthworm invasion on TSR, fine-root distributions, and aboveground litterfall flux in two sugar maple-dominated forests in two locations in New York State, USA. The Arnot Forest in central New York was harvested in the late 19th century and has no history of cultivation. Tompkins Farm in eastern New York regenerated following abandonment from cultivation approximately 75 years ago. Arnot had 20% higher total soil CO2 efflux (880 g C m(-2) year(-1)) than Tompkins (715 g C m(-2) year (-1)). The presence of earthworms had no influence on TSR at either location. However, fineroot (< 1 mm diameter) biomass in earthworm plots (350 g/m(2)) was significantly lower than in worm-free reference plots (440 g/m(2)) at Arnot. Fine-root nitrogen (N) concentrations were not influenced by earthworms, and total fine-root N content was significantly reduced in the presence of earthworms at Arnot. Our results indicate that the presence of exotic earthworms is not presently affecting net C emission from soil in these forests. They also suggest a change in root function in earthworm plots that is not associated with higher fine-root N concentration, but that increases efficiency of nutrient uptake and also may enhance the belowground supply of C for heterotroph metabolism.
