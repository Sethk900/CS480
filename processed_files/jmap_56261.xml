Deep-water bivalve mollusks collected during the TALUD XV cruise off the west coast of the southern Baja California Peninsula, MexicoDuring the TALUD XV research cruise off the southern part of the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico, samples of macro-invertebrates obtained in the deep-sea (296–2136 m) revealed a rich fauna of bivalves (17 species belonging to 10 families). The number of species per station varied from one to five. The richest families were Nuculidae, Nuculanidae, Neilonellidae, Limidae, and Cuspidariidae. Solemyidae, Lucinidae, Poromyidae, Verticordiidae, and Pectinidae were each represented by a single species. Some species groups need a thorough revision and were tentatively identified (Nuculana cf. hamata, Limatula cf. saturna).  New information  Significant new distribution information is provided for two species, both recorded for the first time from off western Mexico: Ennucula panamina with an extension of its known distribution over 20° of latitude north and Jupiteria callimene with an extension of 16° 42' of latitude to the north. One species (Ennucula taeniolata) is reported in shallower depth and one in deeper water (Acesta sphoni). New records are provided for an additional nine species. Environmental and habitat conditions are given for the first time for many of the bivalve species.
