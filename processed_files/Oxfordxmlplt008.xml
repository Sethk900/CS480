In North America,  Phragmites australis  (common reed) has generally been regarded as a weed to be controlled. This paper shows that  Phragmites -dominated vegetation provides important non-habitat ecosystem services (e.g., carbon sequestration, water quality maintenance) in proportion to its biomass, and many habitat functions for other organisms that vary depending on characteristics of the vegetation and surrounding landscape.  Phragmites  has both detrimental and beneficial functions; therefore decision-makers must clarify their management goals and understand the local situation. Extensive dense  Phragmites  may be managed to optimize ecosystem services by partial removal of biomass for a bioenergy feedstock.   Phragmites australis  (common reed) is widespread in North America, with native and non-native haplotypes. Many ecologists and wetland managers have considered  P. australis  a weed with little value to the native biota or human society. I document important ecosystem services of  Phragmites  including support for many common and rare species of plants and animals. This paper is based on an extensive review of the ecology and natural history literature, discussions with field workers, and observations in 13 US states and one Canadian province during the past 40 years.  Phragmites  sequesters nutrients, heavy metals and carbon, builds and stabilizes soils, and creates self-maintaining vegetation in urban and industrial areas where many plants do not thrive. These non-habitat ecosystem services are proportional to biomass and productivity.  Phragmites  was widely used by Native Americans for many purposes; the most important current direct use is for the treatment of wastes. Most of the knowledge of non-habitat ecosystem services is based on studies of  P. australis  haplotype M (an Old World haplotype).  Phragmites  also has habitat functions for many organisms. These functions depend on the characteristics of the landscape, habitat,  Phragmites  stand, species using  Phragmites  and life history element .  The functions that  Phragmites  provides for many species are optimal at lower levels of  Phragmites  biomass and extent of stands. Old World  Phragmites , contrary to many published statements, as well as North American native  Phragmites,  provide valuable ecosystem services including products for human use and habitat functions for other organisms.  Phragmites  stands may need management (e.g. thinning, fragmentation, containment or removal) to create or maintain suitable habitat for desired species of animals and plants.   Phragmites australis  (common reed, hereinafter  Phragmites ) is widespread in North America ( Clevering and Lissner 1999 ). Pre-Columbian Holocene fossils have been found in many localities ( Rigg and Richardson 1938 ; additional citations in  Kiviat and Hamilton 2001 ) and 40 000-year-old  Phragmites  was found in coprolites of the extinct  Nothrotheriops shastensis  (Shasta ground sloth) in an Arizona cave ( Hansen 1978 ). Although  Phragmites  was evidently widespread in pre-Columbian North America, it is unclear how frequent or extensive it was in individual localities.  Phragmites  now occurs in patches in, or dominates the vegetation of, many fresh and brackish wetlands, littoral zones of lakes and ponds, disturbed wetlands, wet meadows, springs, seeps, ditches, swales and waste ground habitats such as wetland fill, mined areas and garbage landfill cover.  There are native and non-native haplotypes of  P. australis  in North America ( Saltonstall 2002 ;  Saltonstall  et al.  2004 ). Excluding â€˜Gulf Coastâ€™  Phragmites , I refer to the native haplotypes as â€˜nativeâ€™  Phragmites , and the non-native haplotype M as â€˜Old Worldâ€™  Phragmites  because it is widespread in Africa and Asia as well as Europe. (Native  Phragmites  was called  Phragmites australis americanus , and Old World  Phragmites  was called  P. a. australis  by  Saltonstall  et al.  2004 .) In North America, Old World  Phragmites  is most common in the northeastern states and progressively less common westward across the continent; native  Phragmites  is rare in the northeastern states, somewhat more common in the Middle Atlantic states, and most common in the western states ( Saltonstall 2002 ). Gulf Coast  Phragmites  ( P. a. berlandieri ,  sensu   Saltonstall  et al.  2004 ) occurs in peninsular Florida and on the Gulf Coast; it is a hybrid of Old World  P. australis  and  P. mauritianus  ( Lambertini  et al.  2012 a  ). On morphological grounds,  Ward (2010)  asserted that Gulf Coast  Phragmites  of peninsular Florida is actually the widespread tropical species  Phragmites karka .  Lambertini  et al.  (2012 a )  discerned long-distance dispersal and hybridization of  Phragmites  on the US Gulf Coast and questioned the application of traditional species concepts to  Phragmites . Genetic diversity is also high within all three kinds of  Phragmites , and there is hybridization among the three entities ( Lambertini  et al.  2012 a  ,   b  ;  Meyerson  et al.  2012 ).  Several morphological and physiological features distinguish  Phragmites  from other wetland graminoids.  Phragmites  is large; it produces extensive colonies by means of underground rhizomes and ground-surface stolons, and the aerial shoots (culms) are 1â€“4+ m tall. Peak aboveground biomass in well-developed stands of the non-native haplotype M in the northeastern states can be 730â€“3700 g dry weight (dw) m âˆ’2  and exceeds the aboveground biomass of co-occurring marsh plants ( Meyerson  et al.  2000 ). One estimate of underground biomass from a New Jersey freshwater tidal marsh was 7180 g dw m âˆ’2 , 6.7 times the peak aboveground biomass ( Walker and Good 1976 ), and another estimate of underground biomass from a brackish tidal marsh in New Jersey was 1368 g dw m âˆ’2  ( Windham 2001 ). In 17 studies, the density of living culms was 13â€“125 m âˆ’2  ( Meyerson  et al.  2000 ). In a freshwater tidal marsh on the Hudson River, standing (dead) mass in approximately April was similar to standing (dead plus live) mass in late June ( Krause  et al.  1997 ). Culms and leaves are rich in structural materials, including silica which stiffens these plant parts and helps to protect them from consumers and mechanical damage. In a European freshwater tidal marsh,  Phragmites  played an important role in cycling silicon ( Struyf  et al.  2007 ).  Although many dead culms stand for 2 years,  Phragmites  leaf blades decompose more rapidly; nonetheless,  Phragmites  litter may sequester nutrients and make them unavailable to other organisms ( Meyerson  et al.  2000 ).  Phragmites  marshes are capable of removing large amounts of pollutional nitrogen from surface waters (e.g. in Spain,  GonzÃ¡lez-Alcaraz  et al.  2012 ). In the Chesapeake Bay region,  Mozdzer  et al.  (2010)  found that both  Phragmites  and  Spartina alterniflora  assimilated amino acids directly, and that urea nitrogen assimilation was greater in both native and Old World  Phragmites  than in  Spartina . They also found affinity for dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in decreasing order in native  Phragmites , Old World  Phragmites  and  Spartina , and estimated that as much as 47 % of  Phragmites  nitrogen demand could be satisfied by DON.  Phragmites  is effective in taking up nitrogen from the soil, and due to the greater biomass of  Phragmites  relative to co-occurring plants, aboveground standing stocks of nitrogen may be 2â€“3 times higher in  Phragmites  stands ( Meyerson  et al.  2000 ). In keeping with its high productivity,  Phragmites  efficiently oxygenates the rhizosphere during the growing season ( Armstrong and Armstrong 1990 ).  Phragmites  has a C 3  mechanism of carbon fixation and mature leaves have a structure consonant with that mechanism; however, the anatomy of young leaves is more like that of a C 4  species ( Antonielli  et al.  2002 ).  Invasibility due to human alteration of hydrology, water quality, soils and vegetation plays an important role in the spread of haplotype M in North America ( Kettenring  et al.  2012 ). Seed viability of Old World  Phragmites  was low but variable in the Chesapeake Bay region, and some seeds were dormant at maturity whereas others were not ( Kettenring and Whigham 2009 ).  Phragmites  seeds may require special conditions for germination and establishment. For example, falling water levels and exposed sandy bottoms were favourable for the spread of Old World  Phragmites  in the Great Lakes ( Tulbure and Johnston 2010 ). Habitats created by  Castor canadensis  (American beaver), especially exposed bottoms of abandoned beaver ponds, are also suitable for the establishment of Old World  Phragmites  (E. Kiviat, unpubl. data).  Many ecologists and wetland managers in the USA and Canada have considered  P. australis  as a weed with little value to the native biota or human society ( Meyerson  et al.  2000 ,  2002 ;  Kiviat 2010 ). Occasionally, ecologists have expressed the contrary view that reedbeds provide important habitat and other ecosystem services (e.g.  Kane 2001 b  ;  Weis and Weis 2003 ). Here I show that  Phragmites  provides important ecosystem services, among which is support for common and rare elements of biodiversity including many species of native plants and animals. These habitat functions of  Phragmites  are linked to distinctive characteristics of the plant and are generally similar to habitat functions of  Phragmites  in the Old World. I also propose a new approach to managing  Phragmites  to optimize its habitat functions, potential harvest for products and other ecosystem services. It is important to present a detailed summary of habitat functions to create an accurate context for further research and management decisions.  This paper is based on an extensive review of the ecology and natural history literature, discussions with many biologists and naturalists, 40 years of qualitative field observations and a series of quantitative field studies. I have studied  Phragmites  in 13 US states (New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Ohio, Connecticut and Massachusetts in the Northeast; Florida in the Southeast; New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Colorado and southern California in the Southwest; North Dakota in the north-central region) and one Canadian province (Manitoba), as well as three countries in Europe (Czech Republic, Italy, the UK) and one in Africa (Botswana). In this paper, all observations are from North America unless identified otherwise. I refer to  Phragmites  stands or patches as â€˜reedbedsâ€™. In comparing the biota of reedbeds to alternate habitats, I have used abundance (density) of individual species and species richness because those metrics are most commonly available in the literature.  The body of this paper addresses two categories of ecosystem service provided by  Phragmites : non-habitat services, and habitat functions or biodiversity support.  Non-habitat ecosystem services provided by North American  P. australis . The classification of services follows  MEA (2005) .   Phragmites  fencing manufactured by TechnoPhrag, MontrÃ©al, Canada.

Most of the  Phragmites  services shown in TableÂ  1  are clearly beneficial to human society. However, biomass production and soil building, for example, can have detrimental effects on the habitats of certain organisms ( Kiviat 2009 b  ; see below) and may cause infilling of certain non-tidal wetlands to the point of reduction in water storage capacity.   Phragmites  builds and stabilizes tidal marsh soils, and stores carbon in litter and soils more effectively than  Spartina  spp. ( Windham and Lathrop 1999 ;  Rooth and Stevenson 2000 ; K. V. R. SchÃ¤fer, Rutgers University, Newark, NJ, pers. comm.). Thus  Phragmites  may protect tidal marshes from erosion associated with sea-level rise, as well as helping to mitigate global climate change. Soil building by  Phragmites  in tidal marshes appears to reduce micro-relief of the marsh surface and eliminate small pools used as a refuge at low tide by  Fundulus  (killifish) and other small nekton ( Dibble and Meyerson 2012 ).  There is direct use of  Phragmites  for roof thatch and other products in North America (TableÂ  1 ). Thatching is practised on a small scale in Nova Scotia, Maryland, and occasionally elsewhere; however, the expense and lack of a tradition may inhibit expansion of this use. Commercial and home use of dried  Phragmites  for decoration in and outside the house is common.  Phragmites  is rarely planted in gardens or for landscaping (but see  Urgo 2003 ), although superficially similar giant grasses such as  Cortaderia  (pampas grass) and  Miscanthus  (Eulalia) are often planted for ornament. Other uses of harvested  Phragmites  material (TableÂ  1 ) appear to be uncommon or local. Excepting waste treatment, the level of extant direct use in North America is evidently lower than historic and prehistoric use of  Phragmites  by Native Americans, especially in the western USA (and northwestern Mexico;  Kiviat and Hamilton 2001 ), and historic and contemporary use in parts of Europe ( Hawke and JosÃ© 1996 ) and the Tigrisâ€“Euphrates delta marshes of Iraq ( Thesiger 1964 ).  Clearly, the most important direct use of  Phragmites  in North America is in constructed systems for dewatering sludge from sewage treatment plants (e.g.  Burgoon  et al.  1997 ), and less frequently for removing nutrients from partially treated sewage (e.g.  Gersberg  et al.  1986 ). There are probably thousands of sludge-drying beds of variable size in the USA, and these are cost-effective and conserve energy that would otherwise be used in heat-drying of sludge. The high rates of transpiration of  Phragmites  and its ability to tolerate salt, metals and other pollutants make  Phragmites  suitable for drying sludge, and the efficient uptake of nutrients makes it suitable for polishing partially treated wastewater.  Phragmites  has also been used experimentally to dewater dredged material ( Stout 1977 ).  The ability of  Phragmites  to take up metals and other toxic substances from soil and water, and its efficient aeration of the rhizosphere, have applications in phytoremediation ( Weis and Weis 2004 ;  Ma, no date ). In brackish tidal marshes, Old World  Phragmites  was found to take up heavy metals from surface water and sequester them in biomass which would eventually be incorporated into marsh soil ( Windham  et al.  2003 ). Under some conditions, metals are retained in plaques on root surfaces ( Mal and Narine 2004 ). Translocation of heavy metals from water to soil may make metals easier to remove from estuarine systems. This benefit may be counterbalanced by some loss of mercury from leaves to air ( Kozuchowski and Johnson 1978 ;  Windham  et al.  2001 ).  The rapid growth and regrowth after cutting, and high level of biomass production, of  Phragmites  suggest a good feedstock for bioenergy. Indeed,  Phragmites  seems to be as good as  Panicum virgatum  (switchgrass) in this respect, and does not require the energy and fertilizer inputs that switchgrass does (R. VaiÄekonytÄ—, E. Kiviat, F. Nsenga and A. Ostfeld, Hudsonia, Annandale, NY, unpubl. data). We are studying  Phragmites  fuel pellets developed by FranÃ§ois Nsenga (TechnoPhrag, MontrÃ©al, Canada), and the potential to produce pellets from  Phragmites  combined with other cellulosic waste products. Additionally,  Phragmites  (perhaps combined with other organic wastes) should be a good feedstock for methane generation by anaerobic digestion.  GranÃ©li (1984)  suggested the use of  Phragmites  in Sweden for fuel pellets or other solid biofuels.  High evapotranspiration from reedbeds, and their apparently high albedo, should ameliorate microclimates in urban areas and other regions subject to climatic warming by cooling the surroundings and reflecting the solar energy. Transpiration from  Phragmites  leaves was twice that from  S. alterniflora  (smooth cordgrass) leaves in a New Jersey tidal marsh ( Windham  et al.  2001 ). Living and dead  Phragmites  have been recommended for stabilizing and protecting levees and spoil banks ( Headlee 1945 ;  Stutzenbaker 1999 ). Other services are listed in TableÂ  1 .

The non-native sap-feeding  Chaetococcus phragmitis  (reed scale) that is sessile beneath lower leaf sheaths may be widespread and abundant, at least in Old World  Phragmites .  Krause  et al.  (1997)  found late-winter biomass of adults as high as 1 g dw m âˆ’2  in a freshwater tidal marsh on the Hudson River. I have frequently seen songbirds opening leaf sheaths and consuming the scale insects, especially in winter, in the northeastern states. Birds also commonly peck holes in  Phragmites  internodes and eat insects living within.   Hyalopterus pruni  (mealy plum aphid) is widespread and abundant in North America ( Balme 2000 ;  Lambert 2005 ). This aphid alternates generations between  Phragmites  in summer and  Prunus  spp. (cherries, etc.) in winter; it is a pest of prune ( Prunus domestica ) orchards in California ( Latham and Mills 2012 ). Although birds apparently do not feed on mealy plum aphid, Coccinellidae (lady beetles) are often present and presumably feed on the aphids.   Ondatra zibethicus  (common muskrat) is the most important native vertebrate consumer of  Phragmites . Muskrats feed on young shoots and rhizomes, and also cut mature culms for lodge construction. Several studies in different regions of North America have found  Phragmites  ranking from high to low among other plant species in the muskrat diet ( Bellrose 1950 ;  Paradiso 1969 ). Muskrats may use  Phragmites  intensively, depending on the availability of more â€˜preferredâ€™ foods such as  Typha  (cattail) and  Scirpus  (bulrush;  Butler 1940 ;  McCabe 1982 ). For example,  Butler (1940)  listed  Phragmites  as the fourth of 13 plant taxa in the muskrat diet in Manitoba;  McCabe (1982)  found  Phragmites  a close second to  Scirpus  in Utah;  Phragmites  was an important summer food in the north-central states ( Errington 1941 ); in Maryland tidal marshes  Typha  and  Scirpus  were most important but  Phragmites  was â€˜a favourite food, grows in beds of limited distribution, in which muskrats are always foundâ€™ ( Smith 1938 ); and feeding on  Phragmites  in Louisiana coastal marshes varied according to marsh type ( O'Neil 1949 ). Nonetheless,  Ward (1942) ,  Lynch  et al.  (1947)  and  Martin  et al.  (1957)  considered  Phragmites  to be a low-quality or uncommonly eaten food. In Louisiana, 10 % or less of the muskrat activity (including feeding) was associated with  Phragmites  ( O'Neil 1949 ), and muskrat use of  Phragmites  stands in Connecticut tidal marshes was consistently low ( Benoit and Askins 1999 ). Muskrats may be abundant in habitats where  Phragmites  is highly dominant, as at times and places in the New Jersey Meadowlands (E. Kiviat, unpubl. data).  Castor canadensis  (American beaver) also uses  Phragmites  for construction and perhaps eats it as well, but possibly less so than the muskrat.   Sylvilagus  spp. (cottontail rabbits) at times cut many  Phragmites  shoots for food ( Balme 2000 ; E. Kiviat, unpubl. data).  Balme (2000)  found extensive clipping of culms by  Sylvilagus floridanus  (eastern cottontail) in experimental  Phragmites  plots in Rhode Island. I found extensive clipping by  S. floridanus  at a lakeside wet meadow in Rockland County, New York, in 2011. In 2006 I observed much use of  Phragmites  stands (clipping of culms, shelter) by  S.  cf.  audubonii  (desert cottontail) in the Southwest. Domestic livestock (horses, cattle, goats, sheep) graze  Phragmites , especially young shoots in spring, and have caused  Phragmites  declines in some cases ( Kiviat and Hamilton 2001 ). Spatial patterns of reedbeds in relation to fences of livestock pastures in New York suggest that livestock inhibition of  Phragmites  is common.  Odocoileus virginianus  (white-tailed deer) may graze  Phragmites  in Louisiana but it is not a major food ( Self  et al.  1975 ).  Branta canadensis  (Canada goose) grazes  Phragmites  leaf blades, especially in urban marshes of the New York City area, but does not seem to do much damage (E. Kiviat, unpubl. data).  Chen caerulescens  (snow goose) feeds on  Phragmites  rhizomes in Gulf Coast marshes ( Glazener 1946 ).

Reedbeds can be dense, with  Phragmites  highly dominant, or sparse with other species admixed. For example, in September 2000, I found 18 species of associated vascular plants (three herbaceous and one woody vines, two shrubs, two suffrutescent herbs, two ferns, and eight other herbs) in the interior of a reedbed that had been harvested annually and occasionally burned in the New Jersey Meadowlands (E. Kiviat, unpubl. data). These associated species were sparse and occurred just outside the most recently harvested area. Reedbeds that are sparse, deeply flooded, or subject to high hydrodynamic energy (e.g. shorelines of open tidal waters) may support a greater diversity of vascular plants in edges. The occurrence of rare vascular plants and mosses in the interiors or edges of reedbeds under some circumstances suggests that  Phragmites  is facilitating the associated species by ameliorating harsh environmental conditions. Some of the cases I have observed are in relatively high-energy (wave-washed) tidal shores where sparse reedbeds appeared to be physically sheltering smaller plants of other species or maintaining favourable substrates against wave erosion. At Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge in New York City,  Platanthera lacera  (ragged fringed orchid), a regionally rare species, was found beneath mixed upland stands of  Phragmites  and  Betula populifolia  (grey birch), and nowhere else (D. Taft, U.S. National Park Service, New York, NY, pers. comm.). On the Hudson River, three rare native species,  Limosella subulata  (mudwort) and  Lilaeopsis chinensis  (eastern lilaeopsis) in brackish tidal wetlands, and  Cardamine longii  (Long's bittercress) in fresh-tidal wetlands, occur in reedbed edges where the  Phragmites  may be facilitating these small plants by providing physical shelter, stabilizing the sediments, or oxygenating the soil (the last phenomenon was suggested as a process by which  Phragmites  facilitated plants less tolerant to soil hypoxia;  Callaway 1995 ).  Vines, both woody and herbaceous species, use  Phragmites  for support. Vines are especially frequent and sometimes constitute considerable phytomass at the upland edges of reedbeds and on channel banks where the substrate may be slightly higher.  Cuscuta  (dodder) occasionally parasitizes  Phragmites ; all other vines are non-parasitic. Certain robust woody vines that ordinarily use woody plants or permanent structures such as fences for support evidently are able to reach from old overwintered  Phragmites  culms to new shoots of the current year. I have documented &gt;30 species of vines, half native and half non-native, using  Phragmites  as the host (E. Kiviat, unpubl. data). Vines modify reedbed architecture and provide additional food resources for animals.  Diverse mosses and a few liverworts occur beneath reedbed edges and interiors on soil or culm bases ( Barbour and Kiviat 2007 ; G. Stevens, Hudsonia, Annandale, NY, pers. comm.; E. Kiviat, unpubl. data). Bryophytes appear to be more abundant and diverse beneath  Phragmites  where it grows sparsely and the substrate is wet but not long-flooded. A rare species in New York, the moss  Philonotis muhlenbergii , was found beneath  Phragmites  on a Hudson River island ( Barbour and Kiviat 2007 ). Algae colonize the lower portions of culms. Epiphyton (algae, particularly diatoms) was similar in  Phragmites  and  Typha  in an Ohio marsh ( Back 2010 ).  Reedbeds may retain ice and remain cooler than their surroundings in spring ( Meyerson  et al.  2000 ). The resulting cool microclimate may inhibit some biota. Possibly some of these cool reedbeds shelter species near their southern range limits that require cool habitats.  The greater height of  Phragmites  compared with other wetland herbs is a resource for certain species. Although the nests of  Ammodramus maritimus  (seaside sparrow) were placed low in native graminoids in Massachusetts, the birds most often sang from  Phragmites  or a shrub [ Iva frutescens  (marsh-elder);  Marshall and Reinert 1990 ].  Phragmites  located at higher substrate elevations in or near marshes, and perhaps the robust nature of the reedbed itself, can provide shelter from higher than normal tides or floods, as evidenced by nesting  Larus atricilla  (laughing gull) in New Jersey ( Burger and Shisler 1980 ).  Particular features of reedbeds attract birds in many instances. Anatinae (dabbling ducks) loafed on cattle-trampled reedbeds at the Delta Marshes, Manitoba ( Sowls 1955 ). Small, reed-bordered channels were used by ducks during bad weather in the New Jersey Meadowlands [R. Kane, New Jersey Audubon Society (retired), Bernardsville, NJ, pers. comm.]. Reedbeds, especially those with standing water, attract large numbers of roosting songbirds, as reported in published studies and qualitative observations (TableÂ  2 ); in one example, there was a peak of 40 000  Dolichonyx oryzivorus  (bobolink;  Iliff and Lovitch 2007 ). In the Delta Marshes of Manitoba, where native  Phragmites  is a dominant species,  Circus cyaneus  (northern harrier) nested in the edges between  Phragmites  and  Scholochloa festucacea  (whitetop grass).  Phragmites  was the most abundant plant in the vicinity of five nests ( Hecht 1951 ).  Few data are available regarding  Phragmites  support of amphibians and reptiles, although various species have been found in reedbeds (TableÂ  2 ). Under certain circumstances, reptiles appear to be using reedbeds for overwintering or thermoregulation (E. Kiviat, unpubl. data).  Storeria dekayi dekayi  (northern brown snake) individuals have been found beneath small piles of recently cut  Phragmites  culms in a non-tidal marsh restoration site in New York City (V. Ruzicka, Randall's Island Park Alliance, New York, NY, pers. comm.).  Many birds use  Phragmites  culm, leaf, or inflorescence material in their nests. Common muskrat and American beaver use culm and rhizome material in lodge construction. No information is available comparing  Phragmites  with alternate materials. Muskrat and beaver lodge construction may disperse living fragments of rhizome or culm base because some of the nest material remains wet.  The tall, dense, resilient masses of  Phragmites  often provide a buffer between human activities or cattle grazing and wetland wildlife ( Ward 1942 ;  Buchsbaum 1991 ).  Phragmites  screens out some of the noise and visual disturbances. Dense woody thickets can provide the same function, although reedbeds often occur at marsh edges in urban areas and other places that lack dense shrubs or trees. Reedbeds also buffer other organisms from winds. On Lake Poygan, Wisconsin, artificial nesting platforms for  Sterna fosteri  (Foster's tern) were anchored in reedbeds to provide shelter for the nests ( Mossman  et al.  1988 ). Dense reedbeds are noisy when a human or a predator forces its way through the  Phragmites  culms; this warns smaller animals hiding or roosting in the reedbeds.  Mobile animals, such as birds, many mammals, and strongly flying insects, commonly use combinations of habitats to acquire all the resources they need. A reedbed can support one type of activity by a species while an adjacent or nearby alternate habitat can support another type of activity. In Marshlands Sanctuary (New York),  Rallus longirostris  (clapper rail) nested in a narrow fringe of  Phragmites  at the upland edge of a brackish tidal marsh, and foraged in the adjacent  S. alterniflora  at a slightly lower elevation in the marsh (A. Beal, Westchester County Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation (retired), Ardsley, NY, pers. comm.). In marshes of the Hudson River and the New Jersey Meadowlands, larvae of  Poanes viator  (broad-winged skipper, a butterfly) feed on  Phragmites  leaves in the reedbeds, and the adults fly out of the reedbeds to feed on flower nectar of  L. salicaria  (purple loosestrife),  Nepeta cataria  (catnip), and other plants.

A name and affiliation without a year indicate a personal communication.   a All nests found in  Phragmitesâ€“Scholochloa festucacea  edges.   b These three species used a single habitat exclusively; four additional species nested in both  Phragmites  and woody vegetation. Among the latter group, cattle egret had greater nest success in  Phragmites , little blue heron had greater success in upland woody vegetation, and snowy egret productivity varied.   c Nesting in patches dominated by the different plants was proportional to availability.   d One  Phragmites -dominated marsh had the greatest density of rails compared with the expected value; two  Typha  marshes had high densities and one had a low density.   e Normally nested in  SpA  or less often  SpP ; in year of flood tides during April nested in  Phragmites .   f Total individuals and species richness in breeding season related to total volume of annual plants,  Phragmites , and  Phoradendron californicum  (mistletoe).

Phragmites  mostly occurred at the upland edges of the marshes.  TableÂ  4  shows 16 fish studies that compared reedbeds with alternate habitats. Entire fish assemblages tend to be similar in  Phragmites  and  S. alterniflora  (or  Typha ) marshes or less dense in the  Phragmites ; in some cases the  Phragmites  marshes studied were tide restricted. However, the results for a small, abundant, and ecologically important tidal marsh fish  Fundulus heteroclitus  (mummichog) are different. Adult mummichogs are typically equally abundant in  Phragmites  and alternate plant communities, and spawn in both communities. Larval and small juvenile mummichogs are consistently less abundant in  Phragmites .  Raichel  et al.  (2003)  hypothesized that young mummichogs were less abundant in  Phragmites  because of sparser prey resources. Although  Osgood  et al.  (2006)  found fewer juvenile mummichogs in  Phragmites  compared with  Typha , this difference was apparently not related to benthic macroinvertebrate density or taxon richness.  Weinstein  et al.  (2009)  found lower levels of a biochemical indicator of condition, triacylglycerols, in  F. heteroclitus  from  Phragmites  compared with  S. alterniflora .  Dibble and Meyerson (2012)  found that  F. heteroclitus  were healthier, as indicated by several morphological and physiological metrics, in tidally restored marshes with less  Phragmites  compared with tidally restricted marshes dominated by  Phragmites  in Rhode Island.   Raposa and Roman (2003)  sampled three restrictedâ€“unrestricted marsh pairs where fish assemblages were less species rich with greater tide restriction; all restricted marshes were  Phragmites  dominated. Comparisons of fish assemblages in untreated  Phragmites  and herbicide-treated  Phragmites  have yielded variable results ( Warren  et al.  2001 ;  Buchsbaum  et al.  2006 ;  Fell  et al.  2006 ). In some cases the designs of nekton studies were confounded by elevation differences between  Phragmites  reedbeds and alternate habitats (e.g.  Osgood  et al.  2003 ), lack of measurement of elevation, or possibly hydrology and salinity rather than  Phragmites per se .   Meyer (2003)  found amphibian species richness to be similar in  Phragmites ,  Typha , and â€˜marsh meadowâ€™ in non-tidal wetlands of Long Point (Lake Erie), Ontario, but a lower abundance in  Phragmites  compared with the alternate habitats. Also at Long Point,  Bolton and Brooks (2010)  documented rapidly spreading upland  Phragmites  overgrowing and detrimentally shading nest sites of freshwater turtles during incubation.  Relatively much is known about bird use of  Phragmites , although this information is distributed unevenly by taxon, season, geographic region, and habitat (TableÂ  5 ). In some cases, birds appear to actively select  Phragmites  habitat. Examples include  Sterna hirundo  (common tern) nesting in offshore reedbeds in Lake Poygan, Wisconsin (L. Bodensteiner, Western Washington University, USA, unpubl. data),  Oxyura jamaicensis  (ruddy duck) and  Fulica americana  (American coot) nesting only in reedbeds in New Jersey (Kane  2001 a  ,   b  ), and flocks of Hirundinidae (swallows), Icteridae (blackbirds), and other songbirds roosting in reedbeds in a freshwater tidal marsh on the Hudson River ( Kiviat and Talmage 2006 ). In Maryland, blackbirds flew from as far away as 25 km to roost in reedbeds ( Meanley 1993 ). Certain other species of birds have been found to avoid reedbeds, such as  Leucophaeus pipixcan  (Franklin's gull) at Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge in Utah ( Olson 2007 ). Three species of conservation concern in Connecticut,  Catoptrophorus semipalmatus  (willet),  Ammodramus caudacutus  (saltmarsh sparrow), and  A. maritimus  (seaside sparrow), nested in the short graminoid meadows ( Spartina patens , etc.) of the high salt marsh ( Benoit and Askins 1999 ) and not in reedbeds. However,  DiQuinzio  et al.  (2002) , in nearby Rhode Island, found saltmarsh sparrow nesting in short  Phragmites  as well as in short native graminoids in a tidally restricted marsh. Although  Sowls (1955)  reported that nests of five species of Anatinae (dabbling ducks) were more common in alternate grass communities than in  Phragmites , in the same wetland complex  Ward (1942)  stated that 31 % of 147 nests of â€˜land-nestingâ€™ ducks were in  Phragmites  edges. Ward considered water edges and wet meadow edges of reedbeds, mats of lodged culms in the water edges of reedbeds, small beds surrounded by wet meadow, and newly established, sparse reedbeds to be particularly favourable locations for duck nests. The difference between these two studies may have been due to the definition of reedbed edges or to reedbed management.  Of 17 studies of breeding birds in reedbeds compared with an alternate habitat (TableÂ  5 ), there were about 16 instances of species that were more abundant in  Phragmites , and about 36 instances of species more abundant in the alternate habitat (these tallies include some duplication of species among studies). Of six studies of non-breeding birds, there were about 13 instances of species that were more abundant in reedbeds and three instances of species more abundant in the alternate habitat. These numbers suggest that reedbeds offer more functions to non-breeding birds (e.g. cover for roosting and escape from predators), but the fact that &gt;75 species of North American birds have been reported to be breeding in  Phragmites -dominated habitat (some examples in TableÂ  2 ) indicates the need for a broader range of studies.  Meyer's (2003)  study of birds in  Phragmites ,  Typha , and marsh meadow at a Lake Erie site in Ontario indicated the complexity of  Phragmites â€“bird relationships, which varied by habitat, stand edge compared with interior, season, and bird species. At a large and longstanding rookery on Pea Patch Island in Delaware Bay ( Parsons 2003 ), two species of long-legged wading birds nested only in upland shrubs and trees, four species nested in that woody vegetation as well as in  Phragmites  marsh, and one species nested only in reedbeds. Of the four species that nested in both habitats, one had greater egg and nestling productivity in the reedbeds and one had greater productivity in the woody vegetation. Although alternate habitats may be better for more species, there are many cases where reedbeds are better for a particular species.  No bird that breeds in the U.S. or Canada is known to depend wholly on  Phragmites , although certain birds breed only in  Phragmites  marshes in particular regions (e.g.  Fulica americana  and  Oxyura jamaicensis  in New Jersey ( Kane 2001 a  ,   b  ).  Geothlypis beldingi  (Belding's yellowthroat, a wood warbler endemic to the oases of Baja California Sur, Mexico) breeds only in association with  Phragmites  reedbeds ( RodrÃ­guez-Estrella  et al.  1999 ).  Although various species of small and large mammals have been reported using reedbeds (TableÂ  2 ), few quantitative data are available.  Meyer (2003)  found greater abundance and richness of small mammals in  Phragmites  compared with  Typha  or marsh meadow in non-tidal wetlands of Long Point, Ontario. However,  Meyer (2003)  found white-tailed deer tracks to be more common in grass and sedge-dominated marsh meadow and  Typha  compared with  Phragmites. Peromyscus leucopus  (white-footed mouse) and the non-native  Mus musculus  (house mouse) frequented reedbeds in a Connecticut estuary, whereas  Microtus pennsylvanicus  (meadow vole) was more common in  Spartina patens  marsh ( Holland and Smith 1980 ).  McGlynn (2006)  found the small-mammal species richness to be similar in  Phragmites  and two alternate habitats but  P. leucopus  more abundant in  Phragmites  in Hudson River fresh-tidal marshes.   Phragmites  is used by many different organisms. In most cases it is not known whether these interactions are beneficial or detrimental to the species associated with  Phragmites.  In at least a few cases,  Phragmites  appears beneficial: roosting birds in reedbeds, songbirds eating seeds during migration or winter, animals taking refuge from flooding in reedbeds elevated above the surroundings, and small mammals like  Sylvilagus  (cottontails) hiding in reedbeds. In other cases,  Phragmites  appears detrimental: rapidly colonizing and shading turtle nesting sites, displacing the short graminoid community of high salt marsh on the northeastern coast, and supporting fewer young  F. heteroclitus  than in  S. alterniflora -dominated wetlands. If it were possible to replace the  Phragmites  with fully functioning alternate habitats, would there be a real benefit to these species? Does the presence of reedbeds decrease the overall population of  F. heteroclitus ? The absence or scarcity of a species in a habitat does not necessarily mean that the habitat quality is poor ( van Horne 1983 ). We need to understand the effects of  Phragmites  on a species at the levels of population and fitness, as well as the mechanisms of those effects, for each species.  McGlynn (2006)  found the body condition of small mammals, and mammalian predation on artificial songbird nests, to be similar in  Phragmites  and two alternate habitats.  Parsons (2003)  found the hatching success of  Egretta thula  (snowy egret) and  Egretta caerulea  (little blue heron) to be greater in woody vegetation and nestling survival of  E. caerulea  greater in woody vegetation, whereas the hatching success of  Bubulcus ibis  (cattle egret) was greater in reedbeds, and nestling survival of  E. thula  and  B. ibis  did not differ between habitats.  What makes a reedbed attractive to other organisms? The tall, dense masses of leafy culms where  Phragmites  is more highly dominant provide shelter from weather and predators to arthropods, small birds, and other small organisms, but may be too dense or shady for small plants or larger animals. However, large birds such as  Circus cyaneus  (northern harrier), Ardeidae (herons) and Threskiornithidae (ibises) can roost or nest on top of reedbeds with some degree of culm lodging. Large animals, such as  O. virginianus  (white-tailed deer), are sometimes able to break trails through dense reedbeds. Other  Phragmites  characteristics that shape its habitat functions include mats of lodged culms that animals rest on or under, hollow internodes of broken dead culms that shelter spiders, and the soil-stabilizing ability that apparently attracts  Castor canadensis  and  O. zibethicus  to build lodges. Some organisms are associated with high-biomass reedbeds whereas others are associated with low-biomass (sparse, short or fragmented) reedbeds.  Variation in the reedbed habitat.

Photographs by Erik Kiviat.  Litter, including lodged culms and culm stubble, affects animal use of reedbeds.  Turdus migratorius  (American robin) nested on mats of lodged culms ( Hudson 1994 ). I observed  Sylvilagus  cf.  audubonii  in the Southwest using the same feature of reedbeds (Fig.Â  5 ).  Various intrinsic (stand) and extrinsic (environmental) variables may affect the suitability of  Phragmites  as habitat ( Kiviat 2009 b  ,  2010 ). Important intrinsic variables are reedbed extent and shape, the ratio of edge to interior, culm height and density, aboveground biomass, the ratio of fertile (flowering or fruiting) to sterile culms, lodging, litter mass and admixture (understory herbs, woody plants, vines, mosses). Important extrinsic variables are the presence of clearings or pools, soil microtopography and elevation, herbivory (beaver, muskrat, livestock, insects), surrounding land use and vegetation, human activities, proximity of other reedbeds, hydropattern (water levels, vertical and horizontal movement, and timing), soil texture and organic matter content, salinity, water quality, and the effects of ice, floods and fire.  Phragmites  reedbeds in tidal marshes tend to have more live biomass and litter mass, less microtopographic relief, and higher substrate elevation than the alternate plant communities such as  Spartina  spp. that  Phragmites  appears to replace (e.g.  Meyerson  et al.  2000 ;  Angradi  et al.  2001 ).  So far, there have been few studies comparing biodiversity support of different  Phragmites  haplotypes. Native haplotypes of  P. australis  tend to grow more sparsely with an admixture of other plants, compared with Old World  Phragmites  (E. Kiviat, unpubl. data). Differences in insect use of the subspecies were addressed by  Lambert (2005) .  The data summarized from many studies (TablesÂ  2   â€“ 5 ) indicate several possible generalizations about the biodiversity support services provided by  Phragmites . There are many native and non-native species that occur in association with reedbeds. Some of these species are common in reedbeds, and some prefer reedbed edges while others also occur in reedbed interiors. In certain cases, mobile animals are clearly selecting reedbeds in landscapes containing alternate communities; roosting songbirds may be the best example. Because  Phragmites  (at least Old World  Phragmites ) tends to form dense stands with large amounts of live and dead biomass, many other vascular plants may not do well beneath the  Phragmites  canopies. In some cases, larger animals may have difficulty moving through reedbeds. None of these characteristics is unique to  Phragmites ; dense, low-diversity, high-biomass stands of  Typha ,  Scirpus , tall  Carex  (sedge) species and other robust colonial marsh plants are similar in many respects.   Phragmites  is affected by many other non-human organisms; animals eat it, gall it, collect it for nest material and trample on it; taller plants shade it; fungi infect it; beavers flood it; and vines weigh it down. These interactions rarely seem to have a large impact. Probably the most common large effect of other organisms is due to  Ondatra  (muskrat) activities in cutting and excavating rhizomes and culm bases for food and lodge construction. Beaver activities may create habitat for  Phragmites  on abandoned dams and the bottoms of drawn-down abandoned ponds, but may also inhibit or kill  Phragmites  by flooding it. Although in many respects the reedbeds of today are relatively unaffected by the activities of other organisms, three types of interaction are worth noting: (i) sublethal effects that may alter productivity, reedbed architecture or other aspects of  Phragmites ; (ii) effects of prehistoric megafauna that may have been greater than animal effects seen now; and (iii) changing biotic interactions including the establishment of non-native species or increases in species already here.  Although many insects, non-native and native, feed on  Phragmites , it is not generally regulated by insect herbivory ( Balme 2000 ). However, I have seen local instances of significant damage to  Phragmites  patches by insect and muskrat herbivory. The muskrat, because it can reach high population densities, has the potential to inhibit or remove  Phragmites  in small and sometimes large areas; this activity can diversify reedbed vegetation. The combination of feeding on rhizomes and culm bases by muskrats and  Cyprinus carpio  (common carp) with high water levels and wind waves apparently caused recession of reedbeds in Kearny Marsh West in the Meadowlands in the early 2000s (E. Kiviat, unpubl. data). Muskrats, possibly in combination with insects or unidentified factors, fragmented a reedbed in South Glebe Marsh at Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary on the freshwater tidal Patuxent River in Maryland, and a few years later a vigorous but floristically diverse floating reedbed had developed at this site (E. Kiviat, unpubl. data). In the fen meadows of upper Moore Brook, Salisbury, Connecticut,  Phragmites  colonizing  Carex  meadows was alternately inhibited or facilitated by increases or decreases, respectively, in water levels caused by changes in beaver activity (E. Kiviat, unpubl. data).   Nothrotheriops shastensis  (Shasta ground sloth, an extinct large mammal) fed intensively on  Phragmites  at an Arizona locality 40 000 years ago ( Hansen 1978 ).  Mammuthus primigenius  (woolly mammoth, another Pleistocene megaherbivore) ate  P. australis  in Russia ( Farrand 1961 ) and presumably did so in North America. Other Pleistocene large mammals, such as the  Castoroides  spp. (giant beavers) and many species of Equidae (horses), as well as Holocene mammals once much more abundant than now, such as  Bison bison  (American bison), may also have eaten  Phragmites , as modern relatives do ( Peden  et al.  1974 ). Large animals such as these could have regulated or controlled  Phragmites  to an extent that is not seen now with wild mammals but is evident with livestock.  Non-native plants acquire a fauna of herbivorous insects in âˆ¼30â€“200 years as a result of genetic adaptation of herbivores ( Imura 1999 ;  Carroll  et al.  2005 ;  Carroll 2007 ;  Hawkes 2007 ) and possibly other processes. Non-native plants can also evolve to become less toxic to natural enemies and competitors ( Lankau  et al.  2009 ). The time required for adaptations to a non-native plant by users other than herbivorous insects has not been estimated. Old World  Phragmites  appears to be acquiring a biota after more than a century here. Many of the organisms that use  Phragmites  are generalists, excepting some of its insect herbivores. However, because native  Phragmites  is so similar to Old World  Phragmites , organisms pre-adapted to using one should be able to switch relatively easily to the other.  There are several possible explanations for use of Old World  Phragmites  by any particular native species: (i) the species uses  Phragmites  as a result of exploratory behaviour or accident; (ii)  Phragmites  provides a low-quality resource where better habitat is not available, or is occupied by spillover (population pressure) from a better habitat that is saturated; (iii) a species is adapted to use non-native  Phragmites  because of pre-adaptation to native  Phragmites  or other tall graminoids; (iv) a species is an ecological generalist whose â€˜partnerâ€™ range includes  Phragmites ; or (v) there has been recent evolutionary adaptation to increasingly widespread, abundant, robust, productive Old World  Phragmites  (it is also possible that Old World  Phragmites  has undergone recent evolution making it more suitable, e.g. more palatable, to a particular organism). Possibilities (iii) and (v) would result from fitness advantages gained by e.g. refuge from predation, harsh weather, human disturbance or another stressor. A species that encounters  Phragmites  by chance (option i) may eventually develop a more intimate relationship with  Phragmites .  Because  Phragmites  can provide substantial ecosystem services, as well as being a pest, it requires a management approach that is tailored to individual sites and sets of local management goals ( Kiviat 2010 ). An approach that requires or encourages attempts to kill non-native taxa everywhere is impractical, causes non-target damage to sensitive species and wastes resources. The sanctity of native over non-native taxa has been challenged by, for example,  Botkin (2001)  and  Cole  et al.  (2010) . In order to focus efforts on situations where non-native taxa actually threaten sensitive native species or communities, it will be necessary to leave alone portions of stands or even entire stands of dominant non-native plants in certain situations. Although one plant community may support higher density or species richness than another, in most cases it is not richness  per se  that matters to nature conservation on a large scale, and it is more important to foster one or more species because it is a rare species or a resource (e.g. human food) species. In the case of  Phragmites , I propose that the general management goal be the support of biodiversity through conservation of important species, balanced with promoting the ecosystem services and human uses provided by reedbeds. Specific goals should be set only after thorough biological surveys and realistic assessment of the long-term sustainability of any management action. Below I discuss problems with proposed and currently used management techniques and  Phragmites  research, and suggest future research directions.  Classical biological control, in which specialized natural enemies from the non-native plant's native range are introduced to the non-native range, is being developed for Old World  Phragmites  ( Tewksbury  et al.  2002 ;  Blossey 2003 ). Once classical biocontrol organisms are released and established, they are intended to support themselves. Given the ecosystem services provided by  Phragmites , there are several problems inherent in this approach. Biocontrol is likely to cause significant damage to reedbeds established for sewage sludge dewatering or nutrient removal from wastewater. Biocontrol is likely to cause the decline of, or alter the architecture of, reedbeds serving as habitat for marsh and water birds of conservation concern, and providing non-habitat ecosystem services such as stabilization and accretion of tidal marsh soils and carbon sequestration. Specialized natural enemies commonly switch hosts or may have host ranges broader than known; this phenomenon is well documented in insect herbivores ( Strong  et al.  1984 ;  McEvoy and Coombs 2000 ). Biocontrol for  Phragmites  is intended to affect Old World  Phragmites  but not native  Phragmites  ( Lambert 2005 ). Nonetheless, natural enemies specialized on Old World  Phragmites  are likely to switch to native  Phragmites . The potential for host switching will put at risk all organisms that depend locally or regionally on native  Phragmites  for food or habitat, including  G. beldingi ,  Ochlodes yuma  (Yuma skipper) and any other  Phragmites -dependent insects of western North America. The potential for loss of biodiversity is illustrated by the recent description of a new species of fly from native  Phragmites  in New York ( Eichiner  et al. , 2011 ). Furthermore, biocontrol has the potential to affect the ability of western and Mexican Native Americans to continue, or resume, using  Phragmites  in ceremonies, for ecological restoration, or for numerous other historical uses (see  Kiviat and Hamilton 2001 ).  Once biocontrol is released and established widely, it cannot be â€˜taken backâ€™; the only way to protect reedbeds that provide valuable services would be to apply pesticides to kill the biocontrol organisms, and those pesticides could cause disruption of biodiversity and other services. Classical biocontrol, thus, would foreclose the option of managing reedbeds on a goal-directed and site-specific basis ( Kiviat 2010 ; see below).  More than any other technique, herbicides have been used to manage  Phragmites  (thousands of hectares in Delaware Bay alone), and most often the chemicals used have been glyphosate or one of its formulations. These herbicides have engendered genetic resistance in a number of weed species, and there is toxicological research indicating endocrine disruption, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity in animals ( Kiviat 2009 a  ). Even glyphosate used as a cut-culm treatment on  Phragmites  can leak into the environment and harm non-target plants (J. M. Toro, pers. comm.). Prescribed livestock grazing, although often effective for managing habitat for the endangered bog turtle (Tesauro  2001 a  ,   b  ), may harm certain non-target plant species. Mechanical control may also harm non-target plants. Removal of  Phragmites  by any technique may destabilize sediments, mobilize contaminants and result in marsh loss. All these techniques, nonetheless, have a place in the large-scale strategy of management.  Although there has been much research on North American  Phragmites  in recent years, these studies have been affected by the methodological problems described here.  The often dense tall culms impede observer vision and movement, and the abundant, silica-rich, standing dead culms make a loud noise when walked through. It is difficult to detect animals visually, estimate distances to those animals observed and move through reedbeds without scaring (or attracting) birds and other wildlife. Observer trails, and call playback used for surveying birds, can alter the behaviour of animals and cause them to move out of, or into, the reedbeds. These problems could be addressed through the use of small-scale remote sensing, including remote audio or video recording, camera traps, and possibly miniature remotely controlled aircraft (multicopters;  Koch  et al.  2011 ).  Native and non-native  Phragmites  are difficult to identify in the field, and in many cases genetic laboratory identification is necessary. Most studies cited here were conducted before genetic elucidation of  Phragmites  haplotypes, and voucher specimens of  Phragmites  apparently were not collected in most cases. As a result, we know little about the differences in ecological relationships between different  Phragmites  haplotypes.  Most of the quantitative studies have been performed in tidal, rather than non-tidal, environments. For example, of 22 bird studies in TableÂ  5 , 15 were conducted in tidal environments. Almost all of the fish and invertebrate studies were conducted in tidal environments (TablesÂ  3  and  4 ).  Reedbeds, and their biotic associates, are highly variable in space and time. It is necessary to sample widely to capture this diversity. Most of the quantitative studies reported here were performed in the New England or Middle Atlantic states. A few of the quantitative studies were performed before 1990. Most studies have used one or two study areas and sampled for 1 or 2 years. It is not known if the findings can be generalized to larger spatial and temporal scales.  Old World  Phragmites  is probably the most-studied non-native plant in North America. There is a large amount of information on  Phragmites  use by other organisms. Much of this information is qualitative, and much is in the grey literature or unwritten (see TableÂ  2 ). Collecting and analysing this information is a formidable task, and I have probably compiled only a small portion of it in this paper.  Studies of  Phragmites  and other non-native plants in North America have typically begun with hypotheses of negative impacts on other organisms, potentially creating a bias in selecting research questions, study sites and methods, and interpreting results. In many cases, crucial habitat characteristics (e.g. substrate elevation in tidal marshes) have not been measured. Most studies have focused on relatively well-known groups of organisms (especially fishes, breeding birds, macrobenthic or nektonic estuarine invertebrates, and herbivorous insects) that may not represent ecological relationships of  Phragmites  with other taxa or guilds (taxonomic bias is also widespread with regard to rare species in conservation research and policy-making;  MartÃ­n-LÃ³pez  et al.  2009 ). Consideration of the biodiversity support functions of  Phragmites  has often been limited to food (e.g. for specialized herbivorous insects). Comparisons between biotas of  Phragmites  and alternate communities have almost always been based on population density (or catch-per-effort) or species richness, metrics that may not capture critical habitat functions of  Phragmites  for the most important species.  I have difficulty thinking of an a priori reason why a non-native plant should necessarily have a negative impact on a native species of animal or plant. There are many examples of non-native plants providing benefits to native organisms. One of the best documented is  Tamarix  (salt-cedar) as the breeding habitat for an endangered bird,  Empidonax traillii extimus  (southwestern willow flycatcher;  Owen  et al.  2005 ;  Sogge  et al.  2008 ). Another is the use of non-native larval host plants by a large number of butterfly species, benefiting certain species and harming others ( Graves and Shapiro 2003 ). The concept of a priori neutrality is supported by many of the examples cited in this paper. Therefore I urge that researchers begin their studies of non-native plants with a null model (i.e. no differences compared with random).  Important environmental and stand variables should be measured or described as appropriate. In addition to breeding activities, the roosting and foraging activities of birds in various seasons need study. Other important groups needing study, in addition to fishes, estuarine invertebrates and herbivorous insects, include vascular plants, bryophytes, algae, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, terrestrial molluscs, butterflies, odonates (dragonflies and damselflies) and spiders. Species of conservation concern should receive priority attention, along with economically important species and keystone species or ecological engineers. Comparisons between  Phragmites  and alternate plant communities should consider, in addition to population density and species richness, functional metrics such as organism health (condition), diet, behaviour, reproduction and fitness.  Guntenspergen and Nordby (2006)  stated that experimental studies were needed to determine the impacts of  Phragmites  on terrestrial vertebrates of tidal marshes. Studies should include designs that examine responses of biota to experimental management of reedbeds, including partial removal of  Phragmites  biomass.   Phragmites , and  Phragmites -dominated habitats, support many ecosystem services and diverse native and non-native biota. Studies comparing the density of individuals or the numbers of taxa (species) in reedbeds and alternate habitats show variable results. Reedbeds apparently support fewer individuals or taxa of certain kinds of invertebrates, fishes and birds, such as early life stages of the mummichog, three species of high salt marsh breeding birds, and muskrat, than do alternate habitats.  Top-ranked food preferences, and relative density or taxon richness of breeding birds, monophagous herbivores and other groups, are not the only currency by which to judge  Phragmites . Other important considerations include the rare species supported by reedbeds; the habitat functions of reedbeds for roosting, escape from predators and shelter from floods and other extreme conditions; the ability of  Phragmites  to vegetate urban habitats and derelict lands without human inputs; and other non-habitat ecological services provided by  Phragmites . Given the severe changes in American landscapes and biotas resulting from land use, alteration of hydrology and chemistry, and climate change, concepts of the purity of native communities may not be practical for application to abundant, widespread, long-present non-native taxa such as Old World  Phragmites . These arguments do not contravene controlling  Phragmites  where it is clearly a threat to important elements of biodiversity.  The use of  Phragmites  in wastewater management will continue to be important if it is not affected by biocontrol.  Phragmites  has good potential for bioenergy. The use of  Phragmites  fibre for paper, insulation and industrial materials should be explored. Given the new information presented here, we should look at  Phragmites  management as an optimization: how can we manage to increase and make use of the valuable ecosystem services provided by the plant, while reducing the harm that it causes in certain situations?  My participation in the  Phragmites  Symposium of the 2011 Society of Wetland Scientists conference was partly funded by a grant from  AoB PLANTS  to the Smithsonian Institution, and by a donation to Hudsonia from the Kraus Dunne family. Previously, my research on  Phragmites  and its habitats has been funded by the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation, Max and Victoria Dreyfus Foundation, Hudson River Foundation, Geoffrey C. Hughes Foundation, Metropolitan Conservation Alliance, New York City Environmental Fund, New York State Department of Environmental Conservationâ€”Hudson River Estuary Program and Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve, and Westchester Community Foundation (all in the USA).  Hudsonia is collaborating with TechnoPhrag, Inc. (MontrÃ©al, QuÃ©bec) on a study of  Phragmites  fuel pellets; TechnoPhrag also offers  Phragmites  management services. Hudsonia also collaborates with Jason Tesauro Consulting LLC on biological survey and habitat management projects; in other projects this company manages  Phragmites  by means of prescribed livestock grazing. Hudsonia and the author do not have financial relationships either with entities that sell herbicides, mowing machinery or other supplies or equipment used for managing vegetation, nor with entities involved in research and development on biological control.
