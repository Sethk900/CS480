Below-ground carbon stocks in intact and transformed subtropical thicket landscapes in semi-arid South Africa.The feasibility of restoring subtropical thicket using carbon markets is largely a function of its carbon sequestration potential. We measured below-ground carbon stocks and analysed soil properties in intact, degraded and old agricultural landscapes in Baviaans Spekboom Thicket - a highly degraded thicket type earmarked for restoration. Soil and root carbon stocks to a depth of 110 cm in intact thicket were 93 +/- 7 (SE) t ha-;1 and 11 +/- 2 t ha-;1, respectively. Degraded thicket had approximately one-third of the soil (31 +/- 2 t ha-;1) and one-quarter of the root (2.7 +/- 0.3 t ha-;1) carbon of intact thicket. Old agricultural lands had approximately half of the soil (42 +/- 4 t ha-;1) and quarter of the root (2.6 +/- 0.3 t ha-;1) carbon of intact thicket. Soil carbon stocks in topsoil were constrained at low concentrations of extractable K (<0.5 mmolc kg-;1), Mg (<1 mmolc kg-;1), Ca (<12 mmolc kg-;1) and extractable P (<40 mg kg-;1), suggesting that carbon sequestration will be strongly influenced by soil nutrient content. Restoration of Baviaans Spekboom Thicket stands to sequester 70 +/- 8 t ha-;1 of below-ground carbon - an amount rivalling sequestration potentials in degraded mesic forests.
