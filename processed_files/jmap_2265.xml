Recreational Portage Trails as Corridors Facilitating Non-Native Plant Invasions of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (U.S.A.).Wilderness areas are protected and valued in part for recreation; recreational use, however, can negatively impact these areas. In particular, recreational use can facilitate transport of non-native propagules and create open sites for establishment of non-native species. We examined the role of recreational portage trails in the introduction and establishment of non-native plants into the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness of northern Minnesota (U.S.A.). On 20 portages, we sampled non-native plant richness and cover at four distances (0, 10, 25, and 50 m) from trails. Non-native richness and cover were not related to distance from wilderness entry point. Non-native richness and cover were, however, negatively related to distance from trails. All six non-native species we observed were either directly on or within 1 m of trails. These results suggest that recreational trails act as corridors facilitating invasions of non-native plants into wilderness areas. It remains unclear, however, whether these effects are caused by dispersal of propagules, creation of bare ground, or changes in the native plant community.
