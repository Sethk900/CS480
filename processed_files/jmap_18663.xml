SEASONAL PATTERN OF TOTAL SOIL RESPIRATION IN UNDISTURBED AND DISTURBED ECOSYSTEMS OF CENTRAL HIMALAYAThe rates of CO2 efflux were measured by an alkali absorption method (using 20 ml 0.5 N NaOH) from soils in four undisturbed sites [two evergreen oak forests, Quercus floribunda Lindl. (tilonj oak), Quercus leucotrichophora A Camus (banj oak), and two evergreen conifer forests, Cedrus deodara Loud. (deodar forest) and Pinus roxburghii Sarg. (chir pine forest)] and three disturbed sites. The sites were located between elevations of 1850 and 2360 m in the Central Himalaya. The seasonal pattern of soil respiration was similar in all the sites with a maximum during the rainy season, intermediate rates during the summer season and the lowest level of activity in winter. The rate of CO2 efflux was higher in broadleaf than in conifer forests, and it was lowest in the disturbed sites. Among the edaphic conditions, soil moisture, N, organic C, pH, soil porosity, and root biomass positively affected total soil respiration. The proportion of root respiration to total soil respiration was higher in the disturbed sites than the undisturbed sites in winter. Conditions in the winter season were less favourable for microbial respiration than for root respiration.
