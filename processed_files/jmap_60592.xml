Changes in land surface temperatures and NDVI values over Europe between 1982 and 1999We used land surface temperature (LST) algorithms and NDVI values to estimate changes in vegetation in the European continent between 1982 and 1999 from the Pathfinder AVHRR Land (PAL) dataset. These two parameters are monitored through HANTS (Harmonic ANalysis of Time Series) software, which allows the simultaneous observation of mean value, first harmonic amplitude and phase behaviors in the same image. These results for each complete year of data show the effect of volcanic aerosols and orbital drift on PAL data. Comparison of time series of HANTS cloud-free time series with the original time series for various land cover proves that this software is useful for LST analysis, although primarily designed for NDVI applications. Comparison of yearly averages of HANTS LST over the whole Europe with air temperature confirms the validity of the results. Maps of the evolution for both parameters between periods 1982/1986 and 1995/1999 have been elaborated: NDVI data show the well confirmed trend of increase over Europe (up to 0.1 in NDVI), Southern Europe seeing a decrease in NDVI (â0.02). LST averages stay stable or slightly decrease (up to â1.5Â K) over the whole continent, except for southern areas for which the increase is up to 2.5Â K. These results evidence that arid and semi-arid areas of Southern Europe have become more arid, the rest of Europe seeing an increase in its wood land proportion, while seasonal amplitude in Northern Europe has decreased.
