Mapping cumulative human impacts to California Current marine ecosystemsQuantitative assessment of the spatial patterns of all human uses of the oceans and their cumulative effects is needed for implementing ecosystem-based man- agement, marine protected areas, and ocean zoning. Here, we apply methods developed to map cumulative impacts globally to the California Current using more comprehensive and higher-quality data for 25 human activities and 19 marine ecosystems. This analysis indicates where protection and threat mitiga- tion aremost needed in the California Current and reveals that coastal ecosys- tems near high human population density and the continental shelves off Ore- gon and Washington are the most heavily impacted, climate change is the top threat, and impacts from multiple threats are ubiquitous. Remarkably, these results were highly spatially correlated with the global results for this region (R2 = 0.92), suggesting that the global model provides guidance to areas with- out local data or resources to conduct similar regional-scale analyses.
