Coprophagous Beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea) in Uruguayan Prairies: Abundance, Diversity and Seasonal OccurrenceDung beetles have been studied for a two year period (January 1992â€“April 1994). Monthly samples were taken by directly examining 480 bovine and 330 ovine feces. A grand total of 1846 individuals of 12 different species was obtained. The most abundant species were Onthophagus hirculus Mannerheim, 1829 and Canthidium breve (Germar, 1824). However, density values were extremely low and seasonal activity was restricted to a short period. Maximum density in both bovine and ovine droppings was found in November 1993 (8.55 and 8.87 individuals/dung respectively), whereas mean density was 2.57 ind./dung in cattle dung and 1.53 ind./dung in sheep droppings. These density values suggest that populations of native dung beetles in these pastures cannot adequately remove the tons of livestock feces deposited daily throughout the country.
