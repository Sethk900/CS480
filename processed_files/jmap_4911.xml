Two new species of Onychiurus (Collembola: Onychiuridae) from Eastern ChinaTwo new species, Onychiurus gulinensis sp. nov. and Onychiurus antennalis sp. nov., are described from Eastern China. The two new species share most features with Onychiurus, but possess 11 chaetae in the distal whorl of tibiotarsus (seven or nine in Onychiurus), granulated sense clubs on Ant. III organ (smooth in Onychiurus) and three manubrial rows of chaetae present (two in Onychiurus). Here we place the two new species in Onychiurus rather than erect a new genus and the three characters considered to be unstable in many genera are discussed.
