Planning for success: Serengeti lions seek prey accessibility rather than abundance<ol><li>We used long-term radio-telemetry data to investigate how Serengeti lions (<em>Panthera leo</em>) distribute themselves with respect to hunting opportunities. Specifically, we investigate whether lions hunt in areas where prey are easy to capture or where prey are locally abundant.</li><li>We used resource-selection functions (logistic regressions) to measure the location of kills/carcasses with respect to five different habitats: the view-sheds from large rocky outcrops, river confluences, woodland vegetation, erosion embankments and water sources.</li><li>As expected for a sit-and-wait predator, resting lions spent more time in areas with good cover. On a broad-scale, lions shifted their ranges according to the seasonal movement of prey, but at a finer scale (&lt; 100 m) lions fed in areas with high prey 'catchability' rather than high prey density. Plains lions selected erosion embankments, view-sheds from rocky outcrops, and access to free water. Woodland lions tended to use erosion embankments, and woody vegetation.</li><li>The results emphasize the importance of fine-scale landscape and habitat features when assessing predator-prey theory and conservation.</li></ol>
