Morphological and bioacoustic analyses of 11 specimens and several tape recordings indicated that these populations represent a new species, in agreement with a previous molecular phylogenetic study. This species is unambiguously distinguished from its closest relatives by 4 suites of characters: (1) morphometrics&ndash;body proportions, (2) plumage color, (3) vocalizations, and (4) genetics. Using each of these character sets, separately or in combination, one can distinguish with 100&percnt; confidence the new species from its sister lineages. The new species is known from only 5 localities distributed in 2 distinct mountain ranges, 1 on the eastern slopes of the Planalto da Conquista, between the municipalities of Boa Nova and Igua&iacute;, and another in the Serra das Lontras, &sim;100 km to the southeast and only 37 km from the coast. The new species primarily inhabits undisturbed montane forest, from 660 to 1,140 m a.s.l. We estimated an area of occupancy of the species of only 5,885 ha and a density of 0.49 individuals ha<sup>&minus;1</sup>, resulting in a total estimated population of 2,883 individuals. Forest remnants are under severe pressure from clandestine timber extraction and outright deforestation. Under IUCN criteria, this new species should be classified as &ldquo;Endangered.&rdquo;Uma popula&ccedil;&atilde;o isolada, atribu&iacute;da a <italic>Scytalopus speluncae</italic>, foi encontrada no in&iacute;cio da d&eacute;cada de 1990 em montanhas&ast; do sudeste da Bahia, Brasil; posteriormente, uma segunda popula&ccedil;&atilde;o foi encontrada em 1999. An&aacute;lises morfol&oacute;gicas de 11 esp&eacute;cimes de museu e bioac&uacute;sticas de v&aacute;rias grava&ccedil;&otilde;es indicam que estas aves representam uma nova esp&eacute;cie, concordando com um estudo molecular anterior. A nova esp&eacute;cie &eacute; inequivocamente distinta de seus parentes mais pr&oacute;ximos em quatro conjuntos de caracteres: (1) morfometria/propor&ccedil;&otilde;es do corpo, (2) colora&ccedil;&atilde;o da plumagem, (3) vocaliza&ccedil;&otilde;es, e (4) aspectos gen&eacute;ticos. &Eacute; poss&iacute;vel distinguir com 100&percnt; de confian&ccedil;a a nova esp&eacute;cie de suas linhagens irm&atilde;s usando estes caracteres, separadamente ou em combina&ccedil;&atilde;o. A nova esp&eacute;cie &eacute; encontrada em apenas cinco localidades distribu&iacute;das em dois complexos montanhosos, um na vertente leste do Planalto da Conquista, entre os munic&iacute;pios de Boa Nova e Igua&iacute;, e outro na Serra das Lontras, cerca de 100 km a sudeste e somente a 37 km da costa. Esta nova esp&eacute;cie ocorre principalmente em floresta prim&aacute;ria montana entre 660 e 1.140 m de altitude. Estimamos uma &aacute;rea de ocupa&ccedil;&atilde;o de apenas 5.885 ha e uma densidade de 0,49 indiv&iacute;duos por ha para esta esp&eacute;cie, resultando em uma popula&ccedil;&atilde;o estimada em 2.883 indiv&iacute;duos.

These latter species were recovered by a molecular phylogeny as sister to the genus <italic>Merulaxis</italic>, rendering erection of the genus <italic>Eleoscytalopus</italic> to embrace both species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Mauricio4">Maur&iacute;cio et al. 2008</xref>), a hypothesis further corroborated by other genetic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Mata1">Mata et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Ericson1">Ericson et al. 2010</xref>) and a morphology-based phylogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Mauricio2">Maur&iacute;cio et al. 2012</xref>). Prior to 1998, the Brazilian <italic>Scytalopus</italic> comprised 4 species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Vielliard1">Vielliard 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Krabbe3">Krabbe and Schulenberg 1997</xref>), an insignificant diversity compared with the &gt;30 species then known from the Andes and adjacent mountain chains. This difference becomes even more pronounced when one considers that those 4 Brazilian taxa included the 2 species now firmly placed in <italic>Eleoscytalopus</italic>. Thus, the only <italic>Scytalopus</italic> (as currently defined) known from Brazil through the late 1990s were <italic>S. speluncae</italic> (Mouse-colored Tapaculo) and <italic>S. novacapitalis</italic> (Brasilia Tapaculo). The starting point that changed this scenario was the description of <italic>S. iraiensis</italic> (Wetland Tapaculo), which was accompanied by the suggestion that &gt;1 species could be involved under the name <italic>S. speluncae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Bornschein2">Bornschein et al. 1998</xref>). In fact, subsequent analyses showed that a new species, named <italic>S. pachecoi</italic>, and other presumably undescribed taxa&mdash;1 from southern Bahia and 1 from southern Brazil&mdash;were included under <italic>S. speluncae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Mauricio1">Maur&iacute;cio 2005</xref>). Shortly thereafter, 3 new species were described: <italic>S. notorius</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Raposo2">Raposo et al. 2006</xref>), <italic>S. diamantinensis</italic> (Diamantina Tapaculo; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Bornschein1">Bornschein et al. 2007</xref>), and <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. petrophilus</named-content></italic> (Rock Tapaculo; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Whitney2">Whitney et al. 2010</xref>). The first of these was soon relegated to a junior synonym of <italic>S. speluncae</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Mauricio3">Maur&iacute;cio et al. (2010)</xref>, a position followed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Fjeldsa1">Fjelds&aring; (2013)</xref> and strongly endorsed by the South American Classification Committee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Remsen2">Remsen et al. 2013</xref>; <italic>contra</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Raposo1">Raposo et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Nemesio1">Nem&eacute;sio et al. 2013</xref>). Therefore, within &sim;12 yr, the Brazilian <italic>Scytalopus</italic>, collectively known as the <italic>S. speluncae</italic> group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Mauricio1">Maur&iacute;cio 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Raposo2">Raposo et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Bornschein1">Bornschein et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Whitney2">Whitney et al. 2010</xref>), jumped from 2 to 6 accepted species.Another important advancement that appeared in the interim was the molecular phylogenetic study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Mata1">Mata et al. (2009)</xref>, which recovered the monophyly of these 6 species and of the <italic>S. speluncae</italic> group. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Mata1">Mata et al. (2009)</xref> showed that this group is structured into 3 well-corroborated clades: 1 composed of some genetically divergent lineages grouped under the name <italic>S. speluncae</italic>, 1 consisting of <italic>S. iraiensis</italic>, and 1 comprising <italic>S. novacapitalis</italic>, <italic>S. pachecoi</italic>, <italic>S. diamantinensis</italic>, and <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. petrophilus</named-content></italic> (the <italic>S. novacapitalis</italic> clade). Notwithstanding these advances in our knowledge of the systematics and diversity of Brazilian <italic>Scytalopus</italic>, a major problem remained unresolved: the taxonomic composition of the widespread &ldquo;Mouse-colored Tapaculo,&rdquo; <italic>S. speluncae</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Mauricio1">Maur&iacute;cio (2005)</xref> found that populations of <italic>S. speluncae</italic> occupying montane forests from southern S&atilde;o Paulo to Rio Grande do Sul (his &ldquo;southern <italic>S. speluncae</italic>&rdquo;) were apparently diagnosable from those occupying forests from northeastern S&atilde;o Paulo to Esp&iacute;rito Santo (his &ldquo;northern <italic>S. speluncae</italic>&rdquo;), a taxonomic scenario fully congruent with the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Mata1">Mata et al. (2009)</xref>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Mauricio1">Maur&iacute;cio (2005)</xref> also considered that an isolated northernmost population attributed to <italic>S. speluncae</italic>, first discovered and collected near Boa Nova, Bahia (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Forrester1">Forrester 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Gonzaga3">Gonzaga et al. 1995</xref>), presumably represented a new species. Following collection of a voice-recorded specimen in the Serra das Lontras above Arataca, Bahia, by B.M.W. and L.F.S., this hypothesis was strengthened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Silveira1">Silveira et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Bornschein1">Bornschein et al. 2007</xref>) and was also supported later by molecular analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Mata1">Mata et al. 2009</xref>). However, it was clear that further study, including analyses of a representative number of skins and vocal specimens, would be required to permit a thorough taxonomic evaluation of the Bahian birds in the context of the <italic>S. speluncae</italic> group.Here, continuing the series of papers initiated in Zootaxa 2518 revising the taxonomy of &ldquo;Mouse-colored Tapaculos&rdquo; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Mauricio3">Maur&iacute;cio et al. 2010</xref>), we address the following questions. (1) Is the Bahian population of <italic>S. speluncae</italic> recognizable as a species under the 2 most commonly used species concepts in avian systematics (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Zink2">Zink and McKitrick 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Remsen1">Remsen 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Zink1">Zink 2006</xref>), namely the phylogenetic and the biological species concepts? (2) In which phenotypic character suites traditionally used in avian taxonomy (i.e. morphometrics&ndash;body proportions, plumage features, and vocalizations) are these birds distinct from other members of the <italic>S. speluncae</italic> group?In December 2004 and August&ndash;September 2006, we searched for the Bahian <italic>S. speluncae</italic> in uplands reaching &sim;1,000 m a.s.l. in the municipalities of Boa Nova, Igua&iacute;, Camacan, and Arataca. We collected specimens with shotguns and housed them at the ornithological collections of the Museu de Ci&ecirc;ncias e Tecnologia da Pontif&iacute;cia Universidade Cat&oacute;lica do Rio Grande do Sul (MCP), Porto Alegre, and the Museu de Zoologia da Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo (MZUSP), S&atilde;o Paulo.We established a comparative framework that included all species in the <italic>S. speluncae</italic> group, namely <italic>S. novacapitalis</italic>, <italic>S. pachecoi</italic>, <italic>S. diamantinensis</italic>, <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. petrophilus</named-content></italic>, <italic>S. iraiensis</italic>, and the remaining populations of <italic>S. speluncae</italic>; these latter were further divided into southern and northern <italic>S. speluncae</italic> following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Mauricio1">Maur&iacute;cio (2005)</xref>. Our comparisons focused on 3 character suites: (1) morphometrics&ndash;body proportions, (2) plumage color, and (3) vocalizations. Specimens used for comparisons are deposited in several Brazilian museums (see <inline-supplementary-material xlink:href="10.1642_AUK-14-16.1.s1.doc" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary Material Appendix A</inline-supplementary-material>). The following morphometric data were taken from specimens (with a caliper, to the nearest 0.1 mm): bill length (from distal edge of the operculum to the bill tip), length of the exposed culmen, bill depth (taken from the highest point of the culmen to the mandible's ventral surface), wing length (chord), tail length (from the insertion of the central rectrices to their tip), and tarsus length (according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Sick1">Sick 1997</xref>). Body masses were taken from the specimen labels. Measurements of unsexed specimens were excluded from the analyses. We also excluded measurements of worn feathers, and we did not take tail measurements when both central rectrices were lacking. Capitalized color names mentioned in the text follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Smithe1">Smithe (1975)</xref>.We located birds in the field by recognizing their vocalizations; because birds promptly respond to their own song, we actively performed playbacks of the song to detect more individuals and attract them. After tape-recording vocalizations of an individual, we attempted to collect it. Vocalizations were recorded using Sony TCM 5000EV tape recorders and Sennheiser ME 66 and ME 67 microphones. Tape recordings are deposited at the Arquivo Sonoro Prof. Elias Coelho (ASEC), at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and are publicly available upon request; numbers following the ASEC acronym are catalog numbers in that sound archive. We also used some available sound recordings such as those in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Gonzaga1">Gonzaga and Castiglioni (2001)</xref> (see <inline-supplementary-material xlink:href="10.1642_AUK-14-16.1.s2.doc" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary Material Appendix B</inline-supplementary-material>). Tape recordings were digitized at 44.1 kHz, 16 bit, and were analyzed using the programs Cool Edit 96 (Syntrillium, Phoenix, Arizona, USA) and Raven 1.2 (Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, New York, USA). Measurements of both programs were compatible and were grouped for analysis. Spectrograms were produced on a personal computer with Cool Edit 96, with a Blackmann window and resolution of 256 bands. Vocal variables analyzed (from both songs and calls) were pace, total duration, and, for the individual notes, frequency, length, shape, and structure. For measurements of sound variables, we considered only the fundamental (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-f01">Figure 1</xref>). &ldquo;Pace&rdquo; is defined as the number of notes delivered per second and was calculated by dividing the number of counted notes per the time interval between the beginning of the first counted note and the beginning of the last one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-f01">Figure 1</xref>). Short sequences of the song from excited birds (e.g., those with &lt;40 notes) were discarded for song analyses (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Bornschein1">Bornschein et al. 2007</xref>). Songs presenting variations in the first notes had these notes discarded for pace calculation and for other descriptive song parameters (e.g., frequency, length, and shape of notes; see &ldquo;warming&rdquo; notes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Bornschein1">Bornschein et al. 2007</xref>).Sound parameters measured for this study, as taken from voice spectrograms. (<bold>A</bold>) Time interval used for pace calculation, taken from the beginning of a note to the beginning of a subsequent one; pace is obtained by dividing the number of counted notes by the time interval between them. (<bold>B</bold>) Total duration of a vocalization, taken from the beginning of the first note to the end of the last one. (<bold>C</bold>) Note length, measured from the beginning to the end of the same note. (<bold>D</bold>) Upper limit of frequency (&ldquo;top&rdquo;) of a note. (<bold>E</bold>) Lower limit of frequency (&ldquo;bottom&rdquo;) of a note. All measurements were taken from the fundamental, or first harmonic (i.e. the bottom element appearing in this and other spectrograms of this study); its visible frequency is distributed between <bold>D</bold> and <bold>E</bold> arrows, above which are the second and subsequent harmonics.Measurements of frequency and note length of songs were taken from 15 notes of the middle section of each song. For multinoted calls, frequency and note length were taken from 1 note in the middle of the calls, and all notes were measured for shorter calls. When &gt;1 recording was available for a given individual (e.g., 3 songs recorded from the same bird), a mean of its sample was calculated first; then the mean value obtained for each bird was the basis for the calculations of mean &plusmn; SD. Most recordings were obtained after playback. Poor-quality recordings, as judged from spectrograms, were excluded from the analyses.

Analysis of the total of 11 specimens and the tape recordings revealed that the Bahian population of <italic>S. speluncae</italic> is clearly diagnosable from all other Brazilian <italic>Scytalopus</italic> in terms of plumage color, morphometrics, and vocalizations, corroborating the earlier genetic analysis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Mata1">Mata et al. 2009</xref>). Given that we could find no other applicable name for this southern Bahian population, we propose the following:MCP 2004: adult male from Serra do Rio Preto (14&deg;37&prime;49&prime;&prime;S, 40&deg;11&prime;36&prime;&prime;W; 1,110 m a.s.l.), municipality of Igua&iacute;, Bahia, Brazil; collected on August 28, 2006, by M.R.B., G.N.M., R.B.-L., and L.

Soft-part colors: iris dark brown; bill black; mandibular commissure yellowish proximally and whitish distally; tarsus and toes black with dark brown or grayish areas on the middle of the scutellae; under-surfaces of toes blackish; claws yellowish with light brownish base, that of the hallux being brownish with a yellowish tip.

Small amount of molt: some upper-wing coverts on the left wing, some under-tail coverts, and some feathers of head and back.The new taxon is named after our colleague Luiz Antonio Pedreira Gonzaga, who, among many other contributions to Brazilian ornithology (starting in 1974), inaugurated the scientific ornithological exploration of the montane Atlantic Forest of southern Bahia, which resulted in 2 new species descriptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Gonzaga2">Gonzaga and Pacheco 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Pacheco1">Pacheco and Gonzaga 1995</xref>) and several range extensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Gonzaga3">Gonzaga et al. 1995</xref>). These contributions were decisive to call attention to the priority of conserving the region, allowing inclusion of the humid forests of the Boa Nova area as part of an Important Bird Area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Bencke1">Bencke et al. 2006</xref>) and, more recently, within a national park (Parque Nacional de Boa Nova). Furthermore, Gonzaga prepared the first specimen of this new taxon, here included among the paratypes (MZUSP 78810).Adult males in the type series are similar to the holotype, differing as follows: MCP 2003, 2006, and 2008 and MZUSP 78810 have lighter gray underparts, which are nearest to Dark Neutral Gray (83); in MCP 2003, 2008, and 2009 the brown and black barring on the flanks is more extensive, between 25 and 30 mm. In all specimens, the brown and black barring over the rump is also more extensive than in the holotype, covering between 11 and 18 mm. The individuals that are most dissimilar to the holotype are the females; thus, 1 of those 3 in the type series (MCP 2005) is described here: Crown Blackish Neutral Gray washed Warm Sepia (221A); nape, dorsal surface of neck, mantle, scapulars, and back Warm Sepia; lower back and rump between Mikado Brown (121C) and Brussels Brown (121B) barred Blackish Neutral Gray; chin, throat, breast, and upper belly between Dark Neutral Gray and Medium Neutral Gray (84); lower belly and crissum Cinnamon (39) barred Blackish Neutral Gray; flanks Cinnamon to Mikado Brown barred Blackish Neutral Gray (extent of barring &sim;37 mm); remiges Sepia (219) edged Warm Sepia, with outer vane of the outermost primary extensively Mikado Brown; outermost lesser upper-wing coverts Clay Color (123B) with a wide subterminal Blackish Neutral Gray bar and a narrower terminal bar of the same color; remaining lesser-wing coverts Sepia edged Warm Sepia; greater upper-wing coverts Sepia edged Warm Sepia, with some inner coverts having a Blackish Neutral Gray area; tertials Warm Sepia with a subterminal Blackish Neutral Gray bar, which further extends parallel to the rachis for most of the feather's length, most markedly in the outer vane; some tertials with a terminal or subterminal dot Clay Color on the outer vane; remiges Sepia (119). It has 11 rectrices (the 6th feather of the left side lacking). Soft-part colors of birds in the type series are, in general, similar to that of the holotype, with only slight differences. For measurements of paratypes, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-t01">Table 1</xref>.The new species has 3 types of vocalizations: the song, the alarm call, and what we term the &ldquo;<italic>kreew</italic>&rdquo; call, which is probably a contact call (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Mauricio1">Maur&iacute;cio 2005</xref>). Song is typical of the <italic>S. speluncae</italic> group, being the long repetition of a simple note whose spectral signature is a short (0.04&ndash;0.07 s; mean &equals; 0.05 s), downward frequency modulation at 2.1&ndash;3.3 kHz (top of the fundamental; mean &equals; 2.6 kHz) with a well-marked second harmonic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-f05">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-t02">Table 2</xref>). In some individuals a short upward frequency modulation is visible in the spectrograms. The pace of delivery of this note ranges from 3.2 to 3.8 notes s<sup>&minus;1</sup> (mean &equals; 3.5 notes s<sup>&minus;1</sup>). The alarm call is also typical for the group, consisting of 3 or 4 notes of 0.05&ndash;0.11 s duration (mean &equals; 0.07 s) at 1.6&ndash;2.2 kHz (fundamental; mean &equals; 1.9 kHz) with a pace of 4.9&ndash;8.9 notes s<sup>&minus;1</sup> (mean &equals; 6.8 notes s<sup>&minus;1</sup>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-t02">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-f07">Figure 7</xref>).

The &ldquo;<italic>kreew</italic>&rdquo; call is a harmonic-rich series of &ldquo;dry&rdquo; notes uttered at a pace of 24.6&ndash;27.8 notes s<sup>&minus;1</sup> (mean &equals; 26.1 notes s<sup>&minus;1</sup>); each note is &sim;0.02 s in duration, and the fundamental is at &sim;1.8 kHz (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-t02">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-f06">Figure 6</xref>). Although our sample of tape recordings for this call is minimal (19 &ldquo;<italic>kreew</italic>&rdquo; calls from the same individual), we have heard it in the field from another 4 individuals, whose calls were aurally identical to those that were tape-recorded. As discussed below, this call type is present in the repertory of all populations of <italic>S. speluncae</italic>.<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Scytalopus gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov. inhabits the undergrowth of humid montane evergreen forest (&ldquo;floresta ombr&oacute;fila densa montana,&rdquo; <italic>sensu</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Veloso1">Veloso et al. 1991</xref>). Most sites occupied by the species were primary forest, with trees 15&ndash;25 m tall. However, the territories of some individuals included second-growth or disturbed forest with canopy 8&ndash;15 m tall; only a single territory (of an immature&ndash;subadult male) was entirely within second-growth forest. The specific sectors where we found the birds were humid and shadowed areas with &ge;1 densely vegetated ravines, some with stands of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Chusquea</named-content></italic> sp. or <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Merostachys</named-content></italic> sp. bamboos, the former providing more extensive cover.<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Scytalopus gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov. is known from 3 municipalities (Boa Nova, Igua&iacute;, and Arataca) and 5 localities distributed in 2 distinct montane massifs of the southeastern sector of Bahia state, Brazil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-f08">Figure 8</xref>). Localities in Boa Nova and Igua&iacute; municipalities are in the eastern slopes of the Planalto da Conquista; these are Morro do Ingl&ecirc;s, Mata do Dr. Mauro (both on the Serra da Ouricana), Serra do Rio Preto, and Serra do Pote. All these sites are located 114&ndash;124 km from the coast. The locality in the municipality of Arataca is a mountain range called the Serra das Lontras&ndash;Javi complex, which is only 37 km from the sea. There, the new species has been found between 660 and 840 m a.s.l. and in the Boa Nova&ndash;Igua&iacute; region between 930 and 1,140 m a.s.l. Given that the gap between the coastal ranges and the Planalto da Conquista seaward slopes is &sim;100 km and includes terrain as low as 140 m a.s.l., populations from these 2 regions are almost certainly disjunct.Geographic distribution of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Scytalopus gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov., with all known localities restricted to eastern Bahia state, northeastern Brazil (<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>). Note the lowland areas that cause the disruption of the species distribution into 2 populations, and also the presence of records within 2 national parks (<bold>A</bold>; park areas in white).The distributional gap between the ranges of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov. and northern <italic>S. speluncae</italic> is 630 km, considering a nearly straight line running along the coastal ranges on the border of Minas Gerais and Esp&iacute;rito Santo&ndash;Bahia states (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Whitney2">Whitney et al. 2010</xref>: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-f02">fig. 2</xref>). Within this gap most mountain ranges are relatively low, rarely reaching 800 m a.s.l. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-IBGE1">IBGE 1998</xref>) and, thus, presumably not harboring <italic>Scytalopus</italic> habitat, though there are a few exceptions. One of these is the Alto Cariri area, in the border of Bahia and Minas Gerais states, an area with a large forest remnant of &sim;17,000 ha, including large tracts of montane humid forests above 800 m elevation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Bencke1">Bencke et al. 2006</xref>). Fieldwork in the montane forests of Alto Cariri, although revealing the presence of several montane Atlantic Forest bird taxa, did not find any representatives of the genus <italic>Scytalopus</italic> (M.R.B. and G.N.M. personal observation). The surveyed areas included elfin forests (&ldquo;floresta ombr&oacute;fila densa altomontana,&rdquo; <italic>sensu</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Veloso1">Veloso et al. 1991</xref>) at 1,000 m a.s.l. (the highest point of the Alto Cariri region) where M.R.B. and G.N.M. employed insistent playback of the songs of both <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov. and <italic>S. speluncae</italic> during &sim;4 hr, with no responses. Furthermore, R. Ribon and collaborators conducted extensive ornithological exploration of this area; the only rhinocryptid they found was <italic>Eleoscytalopus indigoticus</italic> (R. Ribon personal communication). Therefore, we suggest that this 630-km hiatus is not an artifact of sampling. More to the interior, there is a continuum of area well above 800 m a.s.l. between the range of northern <italic>S. speluncae</italic> and the highlands around Boa Nova, where <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov. occurs. However, most of this land is formed by the Espinha&ccedil;o Range of inland Minas Gerais and Bahia, where habitat is not appropriate for <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov. and <italic>S. speluncae</italic> and the only representatives of the genus to occur are those of the <italic>S. novacapitalis</italic> clade, which occupies drier, seasonal forests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Bornschein1">Bornschein et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Mata1">Mata et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Whitney2">Whitney et al. 2010</xref>). Moreover, there is a large sector of the Espinha&ccedil;o Range in northern Minas Gerais and south-central Bahia where habitats are even drier and where no <italic>Scytalopus</italic> occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Whitney2">Whitney et al. 2010</xref>).We set a point of reference for potential occurrence of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov. at the minimum altitude records obtained at Serra das Lontras (660 m a.s.l.), where we worked from 570 m elevation upward. We measured sampled areas and forest remnants in the program GEPath 1.4.4 (available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sgrillo.net/googleearth/gepath.htm" xlink:type="simple">http://www.sgrillo.net/googleearth/gepath.htm</ext-link>). This effort resulted in the identification of a polygon of 2,970 ha, which also included patches of vegetation in early stages of regeneration. However, because the new species occurs only rarely in this second-growth forest, we considered only mature forest as appropriate habitat, which resulted in a total of 2,878 ha of potential area of occupancy. For the Boa Nova&ndash;Igua&iacute; region (or Planalto da Conquista), where our fieldwork included elevations as low as &sim;750 m a.s.l., we set the minimum altitude at 930 m, our lowest elevation with records of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov. in that region. Considering only forest and vegetation in advanced stages of regeneration, independent of the area of the remnants and distance from larger remnants, this resulted in a potential area of occupancy of 3,007 ha (205 patches of forest; mean &equals; 14.7 ha).<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Scytalopus gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov. is an uncommon species. In 2004, we found only a lone male at Morro do Ingl&ecirc;s and on contiguous slopes, despite intensive playback-aided searches during 3 days of work. In 2006, we detected again a lone individual at this area after specific searches for the species during a day. In the other sites, we found the following number of individuals: at Mata do Dr. Mauro, 3 territorial males; at Serra do Rio Preto, 2 males; at Serra do Pote, a pair; and at Serra das Lontras, 9 birds. The 17 individuals we found during fieldwork in 2006 occupied areas that we had selected previously because they contained good forest remnants at appropriate altitudes.At Serra das Lontras, we sampled 28.5 ha and detected 7 males and 2 females. Assuming that there is a balanced ratio of females to males (which is quite possibly not the reality), this would result in a presumed 14 mature individuals for the sampled area occurring in a density of 1 pair ha<sup>&minus;4</sup> of forest, or 0.49 individuals ha<sup>&minus;1</sup>. It was not possible to obtain an estimate for the Boa Nova&ndash;Igua&iacute; region. Calculating that density for the estimated area of occupancy of the species (5,885 ha) results in a tentative, preliminary total estimated population of 2,883 individuals.The new species behaves much like other <italic>Scytalopus</italic> species, being difficult-to-see animals living mostly among the dark, dense plant cover of humid places. It hops on the ground and over rocks, fallen logs, and low, tangled branches &le;2 m above ground. We detected lone males (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 12) or pairs (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 3); we found females only accompanying territorial males. Females also give the species' song.The new species is unambiguously distinguished from its closest relatives (see below) by 4 suites of characters, namely (1) morphometrics&ndash;body proportions, (2) plumage color, (3) vocalizations, and (4) genetics. Using each of these suites, separately or in combination, one can distinguish with 100&percnt; confidence the new species from its sister lineages (but note that females are not separable by plumage).The &ldquo;<italic>kreew</italic>&rdquo; call described above occurs in the vocal repertory of all populations of <italic>S. speluncae</italic> and <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Mauricio1">Maur&iacute;cio 2005</xref>, present study). The homology of this call type through the populations of these 2 taxa is supported by the similarity in harmonic structure (3 or 4 harmonics), general spectrographic signature (clear upward&ndash;downward frequency modulation), temporal organization (mean pace 22&ndash;26 notes s<sup>&minus;1</sup>), frequency distribution (fundamental generally &lt;2 kHz; <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-t02">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-f06">Figure 6</xref>), and aural quality (as evaluated in the field or in recordings).

Therefore, we hypothesize that the &ldquo;<italic>kreew</italic>&rdquo; call may be a synapomorphy for a <italic>S. speluncae</italic> &plus; <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov. clade, although at present we cannot suggest what its homologue among the great variety of calls known for the genus as a whole might be.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Mata1">Mata et al. (2009)</xref> presented a broad analysis of Brazilian <italic>Scytalopus</italic> including all currently recognized species and some subpopulations in a molecular phylogeny using combined data for the mitochondrial genes cytochrome <italic>b</italic> (CYB; 461 aligned base pairs &lsqb;a.b.p.&rsqb;) and NADH-subunit 2 (ND2; 620 a.b.p.), and the nuclear genes beta-fibrinogen intron 7 (FIB7; 882 a.b.p.) and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase intron 11 (G3PDH; 676 a.b.p.). All data partitions using parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference recovered all sampled individuals of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov. (&le;5, depending on the analysis) as forming a well-supported monophyletic clade; these sampled individuals included the holotype (MCP 2004) and 4 paratypes (MCP 2005&ndash;2007 and MCP 2013). The new species was recovered in 2 different positions within a &ldquo;Mouse-colored Tapaculo&rdquo; clade. Most analyses, including that with all genes combined, returned <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov. as basal to the other populations of <italic>S. speluncae</italic>, although combined data for ND2 and FIB7 suggested that the new species is more closely related to the northern <italic>S. speluncae</italic>, with southern <italic>S. speluncae</italic> appearing as sister to <italic>S. iraiensis</italic>. In any event, except for the latter result, the genetic data corroborate our suggestion, based on voice, that <italic>S. speluncae</italic> and <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov. form a monophyletic clade.Because the new species is a fully diagnosable entity whose diagnostic character states are constant over a considerable geographic area, it fulfills the requirements of the phylogenetic species concept to be recognized as valid. However, evaluating it under the framework of the biological species concept is more difficult, because the new species is allopatric in relation to <italic>S. speluncae</italic>, thus avoiding any direct assessment of reproductive isolation or cohesion. Using the &ldquo;degree of differentiation criterion,&rdquo; in which one must consider the amount of phenotypic differentiation among sympatric species of the same genus or species-group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-daSilva2">da Silva and Straube 1996</xref>), we selected an example of sympatry among Brazilian <italic>Scytalopus</italic> to calibrate our comparisons. It is now well known that the songs of all species in the <italic>S. speluncae</italic> group are very similar, differing only in pace and/or in a few parameters such as note frequency and length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Bornschein2">Bornschein et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Bornschein1">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Mauricio1">Maur&iacute;cio 2005</xref>). Songs of <italic>S. iraiensis</italic> and southern <italic>S. speluncae</italic> differ diagnostically only in frequency&mdash;the former having lower-pitched notes&mdash;and in the modulation of a few &ldquo;warming&rdquo; notes of the beginning of the song of the former; they also differ in habitat preferences (the former lives in dense tall grass in marshes, rarely entering forest cover; the latter inhabits forest and, locally, tall grass in high-altitude fields), in contact calls, and in some plumage characters (gray shading of the underparts); in terms of size, they overlap broadly in all measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Bornschein2">Bornschein et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Bornschein1">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Mauricio1">Maur&iacute;cio 2005</xref>). Despite being not radically distinct from each other, <italic>S. iraiensis</italic> and southern <italic>S. speluncae</italic> maintain their phenotypic and genetic integrity along their largely sympatric ranges, with no signs of hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Bornschein2">Bornschein et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Bornschein1">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Mata1">Mata et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Whitney2">Whitney et al. 2010</xref>, G.N.M. and M.R.B. personal observation). Given that the differences between <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov. and both southern and northern <italic>S. speluncae</italic> in terms of song (pace and note shape) and plumage&ndash;proportions (barring pattern and bill&ndash;wing and tail&ndash;wing relationships) are similar or greater in magnitude to those observed between <italic>S. iraiensis</italic> and southern <italic>S. speluncae</italic>, we argue that, if eventually coming into secondary contact with <italic>S. speluncae</italic>, the new species would maintain its identity as a reproductively isolated unit; in other words, <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov. would be more appropriately ranked as a species&mdash;instead of a subspecies&mdash;under the biological species concept. In any event, it is important to note that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Krabbe3">Krabbe and Schulenberg (1997)</xref> advocate that populations of <italic>Scytalopus</italic> that differ consistently in songs (especially in pace and note shape) must be considered distinct biological species, irrespective of diagnosability in calls and plumage, and this criterion has been followed closely in subsequent taxonomic decisions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Cuervo1">Cuervo et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Krabbe2">Krabbe et al. 2005</xref>), being accepted by the South American Classification Committee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Remsen2">Remsen et al. 2013</xref>). Therefore, given that the song of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov. is perfectly distinguishable in pace and note shape from that of <italic>S. speluncae</italic>, our suggestion of biological species status for the former is in accordance with that approach of taxon-ranking decisions in the genus.The genetic data presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Mata1">Mata et al.

Regarding ND2, genetic distance between <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov. and the other populations of <italic>S. speluncae</italic> ranged from 9.6&percnt; to 11.6&percnt; (mean &plusmn; SD &equals; 10.40 &plusmn; 0.94). The combined distances for CYB and ND2 between <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov. and the other populations of <italic>S. speluncae</italic> ranged from 8.0&percnt; to 9.3&percnt; (mean &plusmn; SD &equals; 8.70 &plusmn; 0.67). The molecular clock estimate given by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Mata1">Mata et al. (2009)</xref> for the <italic>S. speluncae</italic> clade indicated that the divergence between <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov. and the other populations of <italic>S. speluncae</italic> occurred at &sim;7.7 mya.The limited geographic range of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov. overlaps partially with 2 of the 4 areas of avian endemism proposed for the Atlantic Forest by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-daSilva1">da Silva et al. (2004)</xref>, namely Central Bahia and Coastal Bahia centers. They defined Central Bahia on the basis of 4 avian taxa: <italic>Formicivora iheringi</italic> (Narrow-billed Antwren), <italic>Rhopornis ardesiacus</italic> (Slender Antbird), <italic>Synallaxis cinerea</italic> (&equals; <italic>S. whitneyi</italic>; Bahia Spinetail), and <italic>Phylloscartes beckeri</italic> (Bahia Tyrannulet). Coastal Bahia was defined by the presence of 2 species: <italic>Acrobatornis fonsecai</italic> (Pink-legged Graveteiro) and <italic>Eleoscytalopus psychopompus</italic> (Bahia Tapaculo). Populations of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov. that occupy the Boa Nova&ndash;Igua&iacute; region are in the eastern margin of the Central Bahia center, while that in the Serra das Lontras lies in the Coastal Bahia center (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-daSilva1">da Silva et al. 2004</xref>). It is relevant to note that the Central Bahia species are montane taxa, as is <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov., whereas those defining the Coastal Bahia area are lowland taxa. Therefore, we suggest that <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov. is an additional species of the Central Bahia center, possibly together with an apparently new <italic>Heliobletus</italic> species (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Silveira1">Silveira et al. 2005</xref>); this center, on the other hand, might be expanded to embrace montane areas to the east, such as Serra das Lontras, as its eastern limit. This area, in turn, would represent the contact of those 2 centers, given that <italic>A. fonsecai</italic> occurs up to 550 elevation whereas <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov., <italic>Synallaxis cinerea</italic>, and <italic>P. beckeri</italic> occur on the same slopes only above 600 m a.s.l. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Silveira1">Silveira et al. 2005</xref>). In this context, it appears that the name &ldquo;Central Bahia&rdquo; for that montane center is not adequate at all, because at least these latter 3 species also occur very close to the coast, in the Serra das Lontras area. Therefore, we suggest that replacement with other names would better avoid misinterpretations, changing Central Bahia to &ldquo;Montane Bahia&rdquo; and Coastal Bahia to &ldquo;Lowland Coastal Bahia&rdquo; centers. In any event, we suggest that these Bahian centers need a revision to better reflect actual distribution of taxa because, for example, <italic>A. fonsecai</italic> and <italic>E. psychopompus</italic> have nonoverlapping ranges.A little more than half of the area of occupancy of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov. is inside recently decreed Brazilian national parks (58.4&percnt;; 3,437 ha), in particular the Serra das Lontras population, which is encompassed by the Serra das Lontras National Park, and 2 remnants in the Serra da Ouricana, including Morro do Ingl&ecirc;s and Mata do Dr. Mauro, both within Boa Nova National Park (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-f08">Figure 8</xref>).

Surprisingly, no additional mature forest remnants were found visible in 1969 images (with &lt;10 exceptions) in comparison with present-day ones. Additionally, some montane areas with early stages of forest succession have regenerated into advanced stages today.Despite this somewhat favorable circumstance, &gt;40&percnt; of the potential area of occupancy of the new species is under great pressure from clandestine timber extraction, deforestation, and frequent burning to expand areas for pastures and agriculture; these activities continue to diminish the forest cover (both primary and secondary) in the Boa Nova&ndash;Igua&iacute; region. Considering the fact that the new species has a small area of occupancy&mdash;only 3.5&percnt; of bird species in the world have geographic distribution less than or similar to that of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov. (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Reinert1">Reinert et al. 2007</xref>)&mdash;this scenario places the species under grave conservation concern. According to criteria of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-IUCN1">IUCN (2012)</xref> to classify the conservation status of species, <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov. clearly qualifies as Endangered (criteria B.2.a.b.(iii)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-IUCN1">IUCN 2012</xref>).The region of southern Bahia has remained forested as a refuge during cold and dry climatic periods in the Pleistocene, having high diversity of species and several endemic species of plants and vertebrates (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Soderstrom1">Soderstrom et al. 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Rodrigues1">Rodrigues et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Carnaval1">Carnaval et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-643-Recoder1">Recoder et al. 2010</xref>). <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Scytalopus gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov. is another endangered and endemic species of this region, and its formal scientific description draws attention to new areas for investment in conservation, specifically the essentially unprotected forest remnants in the mountains south of Boa Nova National Park, which encompasses most of our &ldquo;Boa Nova&ndash;Igua&iacute;&rdquo; region. We strongly recommend that more fieldwork be undertaken in these montane forest patches to survey their vertebrate fauna and to identify more appropriate conservation measures (e.g., establishment of local conservation strategies) to ensure maintenance of such important forest remnants as the Serra do Rio Preto, the type locality of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. gonzagai</named-content></italic> sp. nov.Fieldwork in 2004 (by G.N.M. and M.R.B.) was funded by BirdLife International (through J.
