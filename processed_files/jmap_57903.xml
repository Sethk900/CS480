Confidence Interval Assessment to Estimate Dry and Wet Spells under Climate Change in Shahrekord Station, IranAbstractGlobal warming and its resulting climate change will affect different elements, such as water resources, in the future. One effect is that rainfall becomes very difficult to predict, as it is under the influence of several different elements. In this study, which considers Shahrekord synoptic station in Iran, various sources of uncertainty in rainfall prediction in the future and its effect on dry and wet spells are investigated. In the present research, CCSIRO, CGCM, ECHO-G, HADCM3, ECHAM, and PCM Atmospheric and Ocean General Circulation Model (AOGCM) models and A1, A2, B1, and B2 emission scenarios under three downscaling methods are examined. The results indicate a significant impact of the various downscaling methods on increasing the uncertainty band in rainfall estimation for the future. The AOGCM models in all of the scenarios except A2 are in agreement. The results of wet and dry spells estimation display a long-duration drought at the beginning of the upcoming 30-year period, followed by a long-duration wet spell.
