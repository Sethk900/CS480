Description of two cave-dwelling mites of the genus Veigaia (Acari: Mesostigmata: Veigaiidae) from Belgium: V. hubarti sp. n. and V. leruthi Willmann, 1935Two Veigaia species (Acari, Mesostigmata, Veigaiidae) are described and illustrated: V. hubarti sp. nov., described here as a new species, and V. leruthi, which is known primarily from the old original descriptions of Willmann in 1935 and 1936. These species are members of the V. exigua group, for which the main diagnostic characters are added, and are both reported as cave dwellers from various subterranean habitats in Belgium. A new key to females of the European species of V. exigua group is provided.
