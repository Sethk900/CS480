Comparative Evaluation of Wattle Ditch Checks Composed of Differing Materials and PropertiesAbstractConstruction and development activities can generate new sources of water pollution by increasing storm-water runoff and erosion. Wattle ditch checks may be used on construction sites to mitigate channelized runoff by impounding water, reducing erosive forces associated with runoff, and creating favorable conditions for sedimentation. This research was conducted at the Auburn University Erosion and Sediment Control Testing Facility (AU-ESCTF) to comparatively analyze eight different wattles composed of wheat straw, excelsior, or synthetic materials to understand the effect materials and dimensions have on wattle performance. This study showed that for a flow rate of 16  L/s, all three materials performed significantly differently. However, as flows increase to 32 and 48  L/s, the excelsior and wheat straw wattles performed similarly when considering hydraulic performance and product density. The synthetic material performed significantly different by impounding more water under all flow conditions even though it was 66 and 147% less dense than the excelsior and wheat straw wattles, respectively.
