Identifying scale specific controls of soil water storage in a hummocky landscape using wavelet coherencyHigh spatio-temporal variability of soil water is contributed from different ecohydrological and soil processes operating in different intensities at different scales. Traditional Pearson correlation analysis only examines linear correlation at the measurement scale. In this study, the correlation between soil water storage and its controlling factors was examined at different scales and locations in a hummocky landscape using wavelet coherency. Time domain reflectometry and neutron probe were used to measure soil water storage up to 1.4 m depth along a transect of 576 m long established in a hummocky landscape at St. Denis National Wildlife Area, Saskatchewan, Canada. In spite of visual similarity of the spatial pattern of soil water storage and elevation, the value of Pearson correlation coefficient was very small. However, wavelet coherency identified strong scale- and location-specific correlations between soil water storage and elevation. The total area of significant correlations as calculated from the total number of significant coherencies at different scales and locations was higher between soil water storage and elevation than between soil water storage and any other factors, which indicated a dominant control from elevation on soil water storage in the hummocky landscape. The largest area of significant correlation was observed at large scales (> 70 m), which can be attributed to the alternating knolls and depressions. The relationship between soil water storage and elevation at different scales was persistent at different times of the year or at different seasons with a slight reduction in the magnitude of correlation. The persistent relationship indicated the dominant control from elevation with slight change in the degree of the control. The scale-location specific correlation provides a complete picture on the controls of soil water storage, which was not possible with traditional correlation analysis.
