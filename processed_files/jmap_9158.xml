Archaeological evidence for pastoralist land-use and settlement in Namaqualand over the last 2000 yearsDespite the extreme aridity of the region, there is good evidence that sheep were being herded in small numbers in Namaqualand up to 2000 years ago. Archaeological research at Spoegrivier Cave on the Atlantic coast confirms the presence of sheep at 2100 years ago. Increasing aridity in Namaqualand around 1300 years ago lead to the abandonment of the cave. Jakkalsberg on the banks of the Orange River in the Richtersveld was occupied around 1300 BP by people who were herding sheep rather than hunting game. People with sheep and goats were herding their livestock at Bethelsklip, in central Namaqualand, between 800 and 360 BP. The archaeological evidence clearly supports a long tradition of herding in the region. The question is whether these early herder groups are the ancestors of the Namaqua Khoekhoen pastoralists who occupied Namaqualand during historical times?  Historical records from the 17 to 20th centuries testify to the seasonal transhumance of the Namaqua with cattle, sheep and goats between the Kamiesberg Mountains and the plains. On occasions pastoralist groups also moved to the interior plateau of Bushmanland to make use of the seasonal grasses after summer thunderstorms. Traditional land-use practices have a long history in the region and a study of these land-use patterns may assist in interpreting the archaeological record and in developing a sustainable land-use policy for the region.
