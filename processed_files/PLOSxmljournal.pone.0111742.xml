Studies of the effects of patch size and isolation on plant species density have yielded contrasting results. However, much of the available evidence comes from relatively recent anthropogenic forest fragments which have not reached equilibrium between extinction and immigration. This is a critical issue because the theory clearly states that only when equilibrium has been reached can the number of species be accurately predicted by habitat size and isolation. Therefore, species density could be better predicted by patch size and isolation in an ecosystem that has been fragmented for a very long time. We tested whether patch area, isolation and other spatial variables explain variation among forest patches in plant species density in an ecosystem where the forest has been naturally fragmented for long periods of time on a geological scale. Our main predictions were that plant species density will be positively correlated with patch size, and negatively correlated with isolation (distance to the nearest patch, connectivity, and distance to the continuous forest). We surveyed the vascular flora (except lianas and epiphytes) of 19 forest patches using five belt transects (50Ã—4 m each) per patch (area sampled per patchâ€Š=â€Š0.1 ha). As predicted, plant species density was positively associated (logarithmically) with patch size and negatively associated (linearly) with patch isolation (distance to the nearest patch). Other spatial variables such as patch elevation and perimeter, did not explain among-patch variability in plant species density. The power of patch area and isolation as predictors of plant species density was moderate (together they explain 43% of the variation), however, a larger sample size may improve the explanatory power of these variables. Patch size and isolation may be suitable predictors of long-term plant species density in terrestrial ecosystems that are naturally and anthropogenically fragmented.  Forest patches sampled are in black, and gray patches were used to calculate a connectivity index or the distance to the nearest patch. The white area is the terrestrial portion of the Petenes-CelestÃºn-El Palmar biological corridor. The small rectangle in the inset at the bottom right indicates the position of the study area on the Yucatan Peninsula. All bars represent 1 km.  The leaves, flower or fruit of plants of uncertain identity were taken to the laboratory for later identification. Biological material was collected under a permit issued by the Mexican Ministry of the Environment (reg. SEMARNAT 31D8B-00780/1303) and field work was conducted with the permission of the authorities of the protected areas (reg. F00.9.DRBRC.002/13 for Ria CelestÃºn Nature Reserve and reg. F00.9.DRBLP.04/13 for Los Petenes Nature Reserve).  Average is the mean number of species predicted by the three estimators. The percent completeness of our inventory relative to the average predicted number of species is shown (Completeness). In all cases, errors represent one standard error of the mean.  Model 1 represents the complete model with six explanatory variables: patch size (Size, on a logarithmic scale), distance to the nearest patch (D. nearest patch), distance to continuous forest (D. continuous forest), patch connectivity index (Connectivity), patch elevation (Elevation) and patch perimeter (Perimeter). Model 5 represents the minimal adequate model and models 2â€“4 are intermediate steps during model simplification. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the proportion of explained deviance for each model (D 2 ) are also shown.  Regression lines for A and B are also shown. The scale on the â€œxâ€ axis for A is logarithmic.  In conclusion, species density in fragmented terrestrial ecosystems can be predicted by patch area and isolation. The fact that the study area has been fragmented for a very long period of time may have contributed to this result as this ecosystem has very probably reached equilibrium. We encourage other researchers to test for the effect of patch size and isolation on species number in other naturally fragmented forests to assess whether it has greater predictive power in terrestrial ecosystems that have been fragmented for geological periods of time and are likely to be in equilibrium.
