Interaction of nitrogen fertilization and irrigation water salinity on growth of maize (Zea mays L.) in a two-way line-source sprinkler systemMaize was planted in a line-source sprinkler experiment in the Negev Desert in Israel. A double line-source system was used with one line source at right angles to the other. It was possible to create a gradient of salt concentration in one direction and a nitrogen gradient at right angles to the salt gradient. Thus the whole range of possible treatment combinations between salt and nitrogen was established in a very small area. The uniform application of irrigation water was ensured by applying non-saline water from sprinkler lines on both sides of and parallel to the salt and nitrogen source lines. The experiment proved that satisfactory results can be obtained when including two variables in a line source experiment. Higher nitrogen levels did not enhance salinity toleration of maize plants in this experiment.
