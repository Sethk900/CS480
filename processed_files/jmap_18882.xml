Soil carbon balance in a native temperate grassland in the Xilin River basin of Inner MongoliaBased on historical data and field investigation, some major fluxes and reserves of carbon were estimated, and a tentative analysis of the soil carbon balance was made in a native grassland community in the Xilin River basin of Inner Mongolia. Major results were reported as follows: 1) Annual average carbon input from above-ground biomass production was 79.8 g C(.)m(-2.)a(-1), and from root biomass to 30 cm. depth averaged 311.9 g C(.)m(-2.)a(-1). The summed mean annual carbon input of shoot and root materials in the study site was approximately 391.7 g C(.)m(-2.)a(-1). 2) The annual amount of above-ground biomass consumed by insects averaged 14.7 g C(.)m(-2.)a(-1), and the carbon output by leaching or light-chemical oxidation was 3.2 g C(.)m(-2.)a(-1) The annual evolution rate of CO2 from net soil respiration averaged 346.9 g C(.)m(-2.)a(-1), and the summed mean annual output was approximately 364.8 g C(.)m(-2.)a(-1). 3) A mature, steady-state system could be assumed for the community for which growth and decay were approximately in balance, with a net carbon accumulation of about 26.9 g C(.)m(-2.)a(-1). Based on the soil organic carbon density of the field, the turnover Irate of soil carbon in 0 - 30 cm depth was calculated to be 6.2%, with a turnover time of 16 years.
