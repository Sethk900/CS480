Interspecific Competition Interacts With the Spatial Distribution of a Palatable Grass to Reduce Its Recruitment.Most arid and semiarid ecosystems around the world have been grazed by domestic herbivores. In many cases, grazing has degraded vegetation and soil. The possibility of restoring rangeland's good condition depends, partially, on the ability of remaining populations of desirable species to recover. In this work, we studied the exact spatial distribution of remaining palatable adult plants in fields with different grazing history (i.e., seed sources) and quantified the effect of interspecific competition with less palatable grasses on seedling emergence and survival (i.e., regeneration constraints). We worked in a Patagonian steppe composed of shrubs and perennial tussock grasses that has been grazed by sheep for >100 years. In order to evaluate the location of seed sources, we mapped the location of a palatable species (Bromus pictus Hook.) in paddocks with different long-term grazing intensity. In addition, we sowed seeds of B. pictus close to 2 dominant, less palatable grasses in 2 different year...
