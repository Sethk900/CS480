New distribution and host records for Hectopsylla pulex Haller (Siphonaptera, Tungidae) with notes on biology and morphologyAbstract Hectopsylla pulex Haller is documented for the first time from Cochise County, Arizona on the Lesser Long-nosed bat, Leptonycteris yerbabuenae Martinez and Villa (Phyllostomidae). This represents the first record of this flea on this Chiropteran Family. The most favorable site of attachment of H. pulex appears to be the head, particularly the ears and tragus. The potential interference of echolocation caused by flea attachment at or near the tragus is discussed in addition to host preferences and specialized morphological features. It is demonstrated that expansion of abdominal segments during egg development is a function of mechanical design and not neosomy such as occurs in Tunga monositus Barnes and Radovsky, Neotunga euloidea Smit and some vermipsyllid fleas.
