Identity of the east Asian millipede Habrodesmus inexpectatus Attems, 1944 (Diplopoda: Polydesmida: Paradoxosomatidae)The enigmatic diplopod Habrodesmus inexpectatus Attems, 1944, hitherto known only from a single locality in Japan, is redescribed both from type material and several fresh samples from Taiwan, thus being new to the millipede fauna of this island. Furthermore, based on its gonopod traits, this species is assigned to Geniculodesmus n. gen., a genus of still vague tribal position, but apparently especially similar to Haplogonosoma Br√∂lemann, 1916, with two species ranging from Sumatra in the South to Japan and the Kurile Islands in the North, as well as to Aponedyopus Verhoeff, 1939, with a few species endemic to Japan and Taiwan.
