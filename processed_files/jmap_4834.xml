Spatial distribution of Neoergasilus japonicus (Copepoda: Ergasilidae) on the fins of bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus)Adult females of Neoergasilus japonicus are parasitic on the fins of freshwater fish. This study examines the spatial distribution of N. japonicus on the fins of bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) from a reservoir in Japan. The dorsal and anal fins, especially the posterior basal part of the dorsal fin, were most heavily infected. When this part was fully occupied, the species moved to other parts of the fin.
