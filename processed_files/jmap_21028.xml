Santocellus (Neuroptera, Chrysopidae, Leucochrysini): taxonomic changes, new description, and a key to the speciesAbstract Santocellus is a small Neotropical genus of leucochrysine lacewings that only recently was separated from Leucochrysa. Here, the features of the Leucochrysa risi Esben-Petersen holotype (a female) are described and shown to support the species’ transfer to Santocellus and the continued retention of the genus Santocellus as separate from Leucochrysa. The valid name for the species becomes Santocellus risi (Esben-Petersen, 1933), comb. n., and Santocellus bullata (Tauber, 2007) is recognized as a syn. n. of Santocellus risi. Currently, this species is reported only from Peru. An illustrated key is provided for distinguishing the known species in the genus Santocellus.
