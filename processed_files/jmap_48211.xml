Multiresolution and Multispectral Data Fusion Using Discrete Wavelet Transform with IRS Images: Cartosat-1, IRS LISS III and LISS IVIndustrialization plays vital role in the overall development and progress of any region. Along with the development, on the same time, it has the adverse impact on environment such as air pollution, water pollution and many others.Wardha basin of Chandrapur district (M.S) has abounded with ample high quality coal minerals. This region has witnessed a lot of changes in land use/land cover (LULC) due to exploration of coal minerals and subsequently the adverse impact on environment. This research explains the use of remote sensing (RS), Global positioning system (GPS), and GIS technology for the detection of LULC changes. In this work LULC changes have been detected using remotely sensed images during the period from 1990 to 2010, using Landsat-TM image of year 1990 and Cartosat-I image of year 2010. The above images were rectified and georeferenced using GPS data collected by point positioning mode observations.Ground truthing for the LULC classification accuracy assessment has been done using GPS instrument. Image analysis operations have been carried out using Erdas Imagine software. Various effects of coal mining activities on the Land use have been highlighted.
