Biodiversity plays an integral role in the livelihoods of subsistence-based forest-dwelling communities and as a consequence it is increasingly important to develop quantitative approaches that capture not only changes in taxonomic diversity, but also variation in natural resources and provisioning services. We apply a functional diversity metric originally developed for addressing questions in community ecology to assess utilitarian diversity of 56 forest plots in Madagascar. The use categories for utilitarian plants were determined using expert knowledge and household questionnaires. We used a null model approach to examine the utilitarian (functional) diversity and utilitarian redundancy present within ecological communities. Additionally, variables that might influence fluctuations in utilitarian diversity and redundancyâ€”specifically number of felled trees, number of trails, basal area, canopy height, elevation, distance from villageâ€”were analyzed using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). Eighteen of the 56 plots showed utilitarian diversity values significantly higher than expected. This result indicates that these habitats exhibited a low degree of utilitarian redundancy and were therefore comprised of plants with relatively distinct utilitarian properties. One implication of this finding is that minor losses in species richness may result in reductions in utilitarian diversity and redundancy, which may limit local residents' ability to switch between alternative choices. The GLM analysis showed that the most predictive model included basal area, canopy height and distance from village, which suggests that variation in utilitarian redundancy may be a result of local residents harvesting resources from the protected area. Our approach permits an assessment of the diversity of provisioning services available to local communities, offering unique insights that would not be possible using traditional taxonomic diversity measures. These analyses introduce another tool available to conservation biologists for assessing how future losses in biodiversity will lead to a reduction in natural resources and provisioning services from forests.  We used Ranomafana National Park (RNP), located in southeastern Madagascar, as a case study to further develop a framework for applying FD metrics to the study of natural resource use. We focused on three questions regarding availability of important service provider groups:  What is the utilitarian diversity and utilitarian redundancy within plant assemblages in RNP?  Which suite of anthropogenic and environmental variables most influence changes in utilitarian redundancy within community assemblages?  Which utilitarian property was most important within a given assemblage?  Filled circles indicate plots along the transect line moving from RNP's edge to its interior. The gray area represents forest limits.  We collected evidence of local residents' use of the forests that could have influenced utilitarian properties within each plot. Evidence of the following activities were systematically collected: (1) number of felled trees; (2) number of damaged trees (e.g., bark stripped, branches cut); (3) number of human trails; and (4) amount of cattle dung. Trees categorized as â€œfelledâ€ were clearly cut down by people, as signs of this activity are persistent. The position of each village was recorded at its center; and the distance from each plot to the closest village was determined using ArcGIS 9.3. The mean canopy height and elevation of each plot was also taken. We also calculated the basal area for each assemblage using DBH.  To distinguish whether an observed change in utilitarian diversity was simply a product of changing species richness (S) and to assess the level of utilitarian redundancy within service provider groups comprising these communities, we used a simulation approach to create a null distribution of utilitarian diversity values for the observed number of species. The goal of the null models was to detect if there were any non-random changes in species composition. Holding species richness constant for each of the 56 plots, we randomly selected species from the species pool (the total number of species in the study) to calculate a null utilitarian diversity for each community. We repeated this 5000 times to produce a distribution of null values and tested whether the observed utilitarian diversity for each community was significantly higher or lower than the expected utilitarian diversity values at Î±â€Š=â€Š0.05. The â€œexpected utilitarian FDâ€ is the mean of the utilitarian diversity calculated from the 5000 null communities for each plot.  In an effort to determine which utilitarian property was most important, we sequentially removed one property from each simulation. We then calculated a new FD without that utilitarian property and compared it to the FD from the model that included all the properties (e.g., FD all  vs. FD firewood ; FD all  vs. FD construction , with the property listed indicating removal from the model). The new FD value that had the largest decrease from the original FD was deemed the most important property. This analysis was done at the plot-level and we report values averaged across plots.  We used Generalized Linear Models (GLM) to analyze the relationship between utilitarian redundancy (as reflected by the Index of Variance [IV] from the null model) and six predictor variables: basal area, number of felled trees, canopy height, distance from village, number of trails and elevation. We did not include the variables damaged trees nor cattle dung incidence, because of the overabundance of zero values for those variables. The GLM model used for these analyses comprised error terms approximated by Gaussian distribution and an identity link function.  The dendrogram was produced by hierarchical clustering by the UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) algorithm of the distance matrix, which was calculated based on species' uses. Horizontal distance represents separation in â€œutilitarian spaceâ€. Species richness for Vohipararaâ€Š=â€Š46 and Mangevoâ€Š=â€Š26; the observed utilitarian diversity for Vohiparara is 24.2 and Mangevo is 33.8; and IV for Vohipararaâ€Š=â€Š0.08 and IV for Mangevoâ€Š=â€Š0.03.  Results are shown across all species, for all sites. Split labels show the criteria for splitting the right-hand branch from the left-hand branch. Tip labels represent mean DBH of the individuals at the tip. For example, at 0-m from village (A), the optimal regression tree identified species used for firewood and rated 2 (good) or 3 (very good) as most associated with large-girth individuals (with a mean DBH of 110 cm). No other utilitarian property was associated with tree size at this location.  In light of these results, one of the goals for conservation, particularly when dealing with rural, subsistence people, should be to enhance or maintain high functional redundancy within ESPs or each service provider group. Moreover, at a community or landscape scale at which multiple service provider groups may be present to supply a range of services (i.e., fuelwood, medicine, construction materials), it is important to maintain a diversity of service provider groups, reflected by high utilitarian diversity. Within each service provider group, it would be important to maintain high utilitarian redundancy, so that the needs of people can be sustained throughout time by ensuring multiple species are available to provide that service in the case that one or several species decline.  One of the advantages of analyzing utilitarian diversity and redundancy is that areas at risk of losing utilitarian species can be identified and be used to prioritize areas for conservation action in conjunction with other priority setting conservation schemes. In this respect, habitats that fall within the significantly lower than expected categories can be directly targeted for either participatory forestry management with local communities or habitat restoration projects that focus on native utilitarian species. Similarly, conservation efforts to maintain certain ecosystem service providers would benefit the livelihood of local residents. For instance, construction and firewood were identified as the two most important utilitarian properties and contributed most to changes in utilitarian diversity. Therefore, species associated with both of these provisioning services are important resources for villagers surrounding RNP and could be specifically targeted for sustainable management programs.  Overall, the advantage of the approach taken in this study is that it presents a quantitative method for integrating ecological, social and cultural systems to address the condition of provisioning ecosystem services. Equally important, this approach translates an analytical method from the ecological literature and extends it to an important applied, socio-ecological question about natural resource use, allowing for a potential exchange of information between researchers and resource managers.
