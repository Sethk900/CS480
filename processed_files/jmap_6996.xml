Seasonality of the antler cycle of pampas deer (ozotoceros bezoarticus leucogaster) from the pantanal wetland, brazilAntler cycle of tropical deer species is little known, in contrast to cervids of temperate zones. Since the antler cycle is controlled by the photoperiod and the consequent pattern of hormone secretion, temperateâ€zone cervids show a seasonal antler cycle. For tropical deer, the seasonality is not well defined or is unknown for many species. This study reports monthly observations of the antler cycle over a fourâ€year period in pampas deer of the Pantanal wetland. There is a well defined antler cycle which appears to be regulated by photoperiod, despite the relatively low variation of photoperiod in this tropical region. The period of shortest daylength (June to August) corresponds to the highest frequency of velvet antlered males (91 % of males observed in that period). Only hard antlered males were observed in November, December, January and February. These results contrast with the seasonal antler cycle of Pampas deer population from Central Brazil, northern Argentina, Uruguay and Argentinian Pampas.
