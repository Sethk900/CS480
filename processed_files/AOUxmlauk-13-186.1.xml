Thus, the spatial configuration of resources within home ranges should influence bird movements, and resource values should be relative to their locations. We radio-tracked 22 Brown-headed Nuthatches (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Sitta pusilla</named-content></italic>) and related their space use and home range sizes to available resources while taking nest site locations into account. We developed utilization distributions (UDs) from nuthatch locations, and treated the area of each 95&percnt; isopleth as home range size and the height of the UD as relative probability of use. We fit models relating home range size to mean resource measures within home ranges, and used lognormal regression to relate intensity of use to resource metrics at random points by ranking linear mixed models. Nuthatch home ranges typically had two centers of activity. Areas of high use were associated with the density of recently killed snags (likely a foraging resource), recent prescribed fire, pine dominance, low tree stocking rates, and grassy herbaceous cover. Home ranges were generally large (median: 7.1 ha; range: 0.3&ndash;47.6 ha), and smaller home range sizes were associated with pine dominance and higher nest snag density. Predicted home range sizes decreased by 77&percnt; and 69&percnt;, respectively, when percent pine and nest snag density were maximized. Our results illustrate that movement decisions within home ranges are driven by both the availability and spatial distribution of resources, while ongoing savannah-woodland management is providing resources that are used by Brown-headed Nuthatches.El movimiento y el uso del espacio en las aves est&aacute;n determinados por actividades asociadas con la adquisici&oacute;n y el mantenimiento de recursos cr&iacute;ticos. Por ende, la configuraci&oacute;n espacial de los recursos adentro del &aacute;mbito de hogar deber&iacute;a influenciar los movimientos de las aves y el valor de los recursos deber&iacute;a guardar relaci&oacute;n con sus ubicaciones. Seguimos con radio transmisores 22 individuos de <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Sitta pusilla</named-content></italic> y relacionamos el uso del espacio y los tama&ntilde;os de los &aacute;mbitos de hogar con la disponibilidad de recursos, tomando en consideraci&oacute;n la localizaci&oacute;n de los nidos.

Los &aacute;mbitos de hogar de los individuos de <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. pusilla</named-content></italic> tuvieron t&iacute;picamente dos centros de actividad. Los &aacute;mbitos con mucho uso estuvieron asociados con la densidad de tocones recientemente muertos (probablemente un recurso alimenticio), prescripciones de fuego recientes, dominancia de pino, bajas tasas de siembre de &aacute;rboles y cobertura herb&aacute;cea. Los &aacute;mbitos de hogar fueron generalmente grandes (media 7.1 ha, rango 0.3&ndash;47.6 ha) y los &aacute;mbitos de hogar m&aacute;s peque&ntilde;as estuvieron asociadas con la dominancia de pino y una mayor densidad de tocones nido. Los tama&ntilde;os predichos del &aacute;mbito de hogar disminuyeron 77&percnt; y 69&percnt;, respectivamente, cuando se maximizaron el porcentaje de densidad de pino y de tocones nido.

The relationship between resources and space use is especially strong for resident species. Many such species move to permanent locations during natal dispersal, and birds then remain on all-purpose home ranges throughout the year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Jackson2">Jackson 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Golabek1">Golabek et al. 2012</xref>). Several studies have also documented extensive predispersal prospecting movements in resident and cooperatively breeding birds, reinforcing the importance of home range selection in sedentary species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Hooge1">Hooge 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Kesler1">Kesler and Haig 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Kesler2">Kesler et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Cox1">Cox and Kesler 2012</xref>).The spatial arrangement of resources should most influence bird movement within home ranges during the nesting season. Central-place foraging influences movements because individuals return to a focal location after each foraging bout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Orians1">Orians and Pearson 1979</xref>). Thus, all birds that incubate or raise young in the nest are central-place foragers during that time. Central-place foraging theory posits that distance from the focal area will impact the relative value of a resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Kacelnik1">Kacelnik 1984</xref>). The value of a resource is influenced by the cost to access that resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Morris1">Morris 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Rhodes1">Rhodes et al. 2005</xref>); a unit of a given resource should be used less when the cost of access is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Collier1">Collier et al. 1990</xref>). For the same reason, treating a home range as an assemblage of uniformly valued resources may be inappropriate during nesting because some resources are more distant from the nest and are thus more costly.Few researchers have evaluated how animal movements are influenced by the distribution of resources and the associated effort of accessing those resources from a central place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Carrete1">Carrete and Don&aacute;zar 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Rainho1">Rainho and Palmeirim 2011</xref>). Further, no studies have examined movement within the home range of a resident cooperatively breeding bird in this manner (e.g., third-order selection, sensu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Johnson1">Johnson &lsqb;1980&rsqb;</xref>, corrected for the influence of a central place). Third-order habitat selection, in which animals select habitat components within home ranges, is seldom assessed in areas perceived by researchers to be uniform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Levin1">Levin 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Rhodes1">Rhodes et al. 2005</xref>).Similarly, animal home ranges are often smaller when available resources are abundant and larger when resources are scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Haskell1">Haskell et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Mitchell1">Mitchell and Powell 2004</xref>). Thus, describing the relationship between resources and home range size could identify possible limiting factors. Our objective was to determine resource selection in a population of Brown-headed Nuthatches (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Sitta pusilla</named-content></italic>). We related available resources to relative probability of use within individual home ranges and to home range size. We accounted for the distance between available resources and nest sites to develop resource utilization functions suitable for a central-place forager (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Rosenberg1">Rosenberg and McKelvey 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Manly1">Manly et al. 2010</xref>).The Brown-headed Nuthatch is a resident species restricted to pine (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Pinus</named-content></italic> spp.) and mixed-pine fire-maintained savannah-woodland, and is endemic to the southeastern United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Slater2">Slater et al. 2013</xref>). The species co-occurs with the endangered Red-cockaded Woodpecker (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Picoides borealis</named-content></italic>) and is widely presumed to benefit from habitat management for that species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Wilson1">Wilson et al. 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Slater2">Slater et al. 2013</xref>). Nuthatches are small (10 g), obligate cavity-nesters and primary excavators, requiring well-decayed snags for nesting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Slater2">Slater et al. 2013</xref>). Limited nest-site availability may drive cooperative breeding in nuthatches as it does in the Red-cockaded Woodpecker, which uses similar habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Brawn1">Brawn and Balda 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Walters1">Walters et al. 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Slater2">Slater et al. 2013</xref>). Nuthatches use all-purpose home ranges throughout the year and can spend &ge;90&percnt; of their time engaged in foraging behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Yaukey1">Yaukey 1997</xref>), suggesting that home-range selection may be influenced by food abundance in addition to nest site availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Slater2">Slater et al. 2013</xref>).We studied Brown-headed Nuthatches in the Pine-Bluestem Ecosystem Management Area of the Ouachita National Forest in Arkansas, USA (34.82&deg;N, 94.21&deg;W), where Brown-headed Nuthatches are common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-James2">James and Neal 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Hedrick1">Hedrick et al. 2007</xref>).

We captured nuthatches with mist nets and by using calls modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Spencer1">Spencer (2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Spencer2">2009b</xref>) in program Audacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-AudacityDevelopmentTeam1">Audacity Development Team 2011</xref>).

We collected 4&ndash;6 ventral feathers from each bird for molecular sexing by Avian Biotech International (Tallahassee, Florida, USA) and Kin Han (Department of Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA). We also estimated sex using brood patches, cloacal protuberances, and behavioral cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Pyle1">Pyle 1997</xref>).We attached radio-transmitters to the two central rectrices using gel-type ethyl cyanoacrylate glue and an accelerant applied to the feathers using a cotton swab (Instacure<sup>&plus;</sup> and Instaset, BSI, Atascadero, California, USA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Mong1">Mong and Sandercock 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Kesler2">Kesler et al. 2010</xref>). Transmitters weighed &sim;0.27 g (2&ndash;3&percnt; of a nuthatch's mass) and had battery lives of roughly 17 days in 2011 (model LB-2X, Holohil, Carp, Ontario, Canada; dimensions: 8 mm L &times; 5.3 mm W &times; 2.8 mm H) and 45 days in 2012 (model A2414, Advanced Telemetry Systems, Asanti, Minnesota, USA; dimensions: 12 mm L &times; 5 mm W &times; 2.5 mm H). Transmitter attachment took approximately 90 s and maximum holding time was &lt;5 min. Transmitters could be detected up to &sim;600 m away under field conditions. If a transmitter came off before the bird had been located &ge;30 times, we attempted to recapture it and replace the transmitter by attachment to the two innermost remaining rectrices. We noted any abnormal behavior including nest abandonment subsequent to radio-tagging.We located birds using the homing method with a handheld receiver and Yagi-Uda antenna (R-1000 receiver, RA-165 antenna, Communications Specialists, Orange, California, USA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Uda1">Uda 1927</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Yagi1">Yagi 1928</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-White1">White and Garrott 1990</xref>). We attempted to locate each bird 1&ndash;3 times each day &gt;1 day postcapture until the transmitter failed, reached the end of its predicted battery life, or came off a bird with &ge;30 locations. Successive locations were separated by &gt;1 hr to ensure behaviorally independent samples and to reduce temporal autocorrelation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Seaman1">Seaman et al. 1999</xref>), and we located birds in a different sequence during each tracking bout to ensure sampling throughout the day. We recorded bird locations with a handheld global positioning system (GPS; Garmin eTrex Vista HCX, Garmin, Olathe, Kansas, USA). We only located birds in conditions of low wind (&lt;15 km hr<sup>&minus;1</sup>) and no precipitation to control for the effects of weather on detectability and bird behavior. We did not sample birds attending the nest and only one bird from each group was included in analyses. We define &ldquo;attending the nest&rdquo; to mean either perching within view of the nest tree while engaged in a combination of vigilance and preening behaviors, or being in the nest cavity. We classified a bird as breeding if we observed it carrying food, attending a nest, provisioning fledglings, or excavating a cavity. We classified a bird as part of a cooperative group if we observed &ge;3 adults simultaneously at any point during the study, territorial disputes excluded. Lastly, in 2012 we revisited on &ge;1 occasion home ranges that had been occupied in 2011 to verify that these sites were still occupied. We counted these sites as occupied if we saw &ge;1 color-banded bird in a 2011 home range at any point in 2012.We searched exhaustively for two birds that were not located immediately by the homing method. We walked in concentric circles up to 450 m beyond any prior location, and drove all roads within 2 km of prior locations to locate such birds using an omnidirectional tracking antenna. We spent 30 min at both the capture location and the nest site attempting to resight each missing bird. These two birds were not located despite these efforts, but had live transmitters during a roost check the same evening. Missing observations can result in bias so we did not include either bird in any analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Rodgers1">Rodgers 2001</xref>). One bird made a substantial directed movement (&sim;1 km) after which it appeared to have settled in a new home range, so we excluded its initial observations and analyzed only its post-movement space use (per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Burt1">Burt 1943</xref>). All other birds in the study were invariably located at will.We developed a fixed-kernel utilization distribution for each bird (UD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Marzluff1">Marzluff et al. 2004</xref>; e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-f01">Figure 1</xref>).

Each UD was bounded by the 95&percnt; isopleth and we treated the area of each UD as the size of a nuthatch home range. Bandwidth selection was calculated using the plug-in method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Gitzen1">Gitzen et al. 2006</xref>). We determined that birds with &ge;17 locations were adequately sampled for analysis (median: 42; range: 17&ndash;63). We inspected each UD and found no apparent relationship between UD topographies or home range sizes for birds with &ge;17 locations and the number of observations used for UD generation. There was also no correlation between the number of locations and minimum convex polygon home range size (<italic>r</italic> &equals; &minus;0.11, <italic>n</italic> &equals; 22, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.30; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Marzluff1">Marzluff et al. 2004</xref>).Illustrative utilization distributions (UDs) of Brown-headed Nuthatches in Arkansas, USA, 2011&ndash;2012. The UD on the left approximates the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Rosenberg1">Rosenberg and McKelvey (1999)</xref> null model where resources are uniformly distributed and therefore selected as a function of distance from the nest site. The UD on the right is a more typical UD where resource configuration is patchy and resource selection is shaped by both distance from the nest site and resource configuration.We randomly selected 20&ndash;59 points &ge;25 m apart within each home range and measured vegetation at these locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-RDevelopmentCoreTeam1">R Development Core Team 2012</xref>). We measured live trees and ground cover at each vegetation sampling point in 2011 and 2012. In 2012, we also measured snags at the vegetation sampling points, but we had to revisit locations where we had tracked birds in 2011 to measure snags and thus we measured snags at a different set of random locations than those used to collect the other vegetation data in 2011. Because we needed snag densities for each vegetation point for our analyses, we assigned a snag density to each 2011 vegetation point by using an inverse distance weighting algorithm implemented in ArgGIS 9.3 (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, California, USA). We used the area-weighted mean snag density from up to 5 random locations within 150 m of a vegetation sampling point with a distance weighting power function of 2.We measured tree diameters, grassy herbaceous cover, shrub cover, and snags at vegetation sampling points. We selected trees using a 10-factor wedge prism, measured the diameter at breast height (DBH) of all selected trees to the nearest 5 cm class with a Biltmore stick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Jackson1">Jackson 1911</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Grosenbaugh1">Grosenbaugh 1958</xref>), and classified them as pine or hardwood (i.e. <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Pinus</named-content></italic> spp. or other). We visually estimated the proportion of grassy herbaceous cover and shrub cover within 12.5 m of each point. We measured the distance to every visible snag detected from each point using a laser rangefinder (Bushnell Yardage Pro Sport, Overland, Kansas, USA) and measured each snag's DBH. Field observers visually inspected snags and classified them as fresh or punky by matching snag condition to a series of illustrations and criteria adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Maser1">Maser et al.

The habitat structure metrics included percent tree stocking and snag density. Tree stocking is a measure used by foresters to maximize timber production; thus, 100&percnt; stocking is optimal from a forestry perspective but higher values commonly occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Johnson2">Johnson et al. 2009</xref>). We calculated percent stocking from our tree diameters using equations for mixed hardwoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Gingrich1">Gingrich 1967</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Johnson2">Johnson et al. 2009</xref>) and Shortleaf Pine (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Pinus echinata</named-content></italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Rogers1">Rogers 1983</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Johnson2">Johnson et al. 2009</xref>). We treated total stocking as the sum of these figures and percent stocking in pine as the quotient of pine stocking/total stocking. We estimated snag density by applying distance sampling methods that correct for imperfect detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Buckland1">Buckland et al. 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Fiske1">Fiske and Chandler 2011</xref>). We pooled data from a concurrent study of occupancy and abundance in the same area, and developed separate models for fresh and punky snags with DBH &ge;10.2 cm. We fitted hazard-rate and half-normal detection models with appropriate site-level covariates for each snag class. As covariates, we considered local shrub cover and percent tree stocking for punky snags, which can be shorter than surrounding shrubs. We only considered percent tree stocking for fresh snags, which are invariably taller than surrounding shrubs but may be harder to see in dense stands. We calculated snag density estimates for each point by correcting our observed values based on the best-supported detectability model for each snag type.We extracted years since prescribed fire and fire season (season in which fire occurred, growing: May&ndash;October, or dormant; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Sparks1">Sparks et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Beyer1">Beyer 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-USDAForestService1">USDA Forest Service 2012</xref>) for each point from a GIS database. Locations where fire last occurred &ge;10 yr ago were coded as 10 to prevent high leverage of model results by outliers; stands &ge;10 yr after a prescribed fire and stands with no history of prescribed fire have a similar structure. We classified a home range as having been impacted by a growing season burn if &ge;1 vegetation sampling point had a growing season burn. Similarly, if a home range spanned multiple burn boundaries, the most recent burn to impact that home range was considered the most recent fire for the home range as a whole.For each bird, we fit lognormal linear models relating home range size to mean resources available (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-t01">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Barton1">Barton 2012</xref>). We fit all linear combinations of models with covariates we hypothesized to be associated with home range size for a total of 32 models. Our choice of covariates was based on a thorough review of nuthatch studies, which indicated that snags, tree stocking, tree species, and time since prescribed fire were influential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Slater2">Slater et al. 2013</xref>). We were concerned that previous studies did not distinguish between different snag types and their respective functions, and decided to treat them separately. We excluded fresh snags, which are of unknown value to nuthatches, from this analysis, but we included punky snags, which are used for nesting and thus may be a defended resource. We also considered fire season because of increased interest in growing-season prescribed fire and its effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Sparks1">Sparks et al. 1998</xref>). There was very little variation in years since fire among home ranges (1&ndash;2 yr), so we concluded that modeling years since fire as a function of home range size was inappropriate.Habitat and prescribed fire covariates evaluated in analyses of space use within Brown-headed Nuthatch home ranges and nuthatch home range size in Arkansas, USA, 2011&ndash;2012.We fit population-level resource utilization functions (RUFs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Marzluff1">Marzluff et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Manly1">Manly et al. 2010</xref>) relating nuthatch space use to fine-scale resources. The resource utilization functions were linear mixed models in which we treated the standardized height of the UD at each randomly selected point as a normally distributed response variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Bates1">Bates et al. 2012</xref>). We used mixed models and included individual identity as a random effect to account for nonindependent responses within individual UDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Bolker1">Bolker et al. 2009</xref>). We fit a priori models that included log-transformed distance to nest in all models and all single and additive combinations of relevant habitat and fire management covariates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-t01">Table 1</xref>) as linear fixed effects, for a total of 64 models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Burnham1">Burnham and Anderson 2002</xref>). Our choice of covariates was again based upon findings of prior studies, a desire to treat fresh and punky snags separately, and a concern for the possible effects of growing-season prescribed fire. We did not consider density of punky snags, which serve only as nest sites for nuthatches. Thus, any correlation between intensity of space use and punky snags would have been either spurious or an artifact of territoriality. We considered fresh snag density instead, hypothesizing that they might be a food source.We calculated standardized and unstandardized model coefficients with unconditional standard errors because we were interested in evaluating the relative value of resources and predicting habitat suitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Marzluff1">Marzluff et al. 2004</xref>). We inspected each UD and counted centers of activity, i.e. distinct peaks in the topography of the UD. Peaks were counted if they appeared to be &gt;60&percnt; as tall as the primary peak in the same UD.We ranked models for all analyses using Akaike's Information Criterion adjusted for small sample size (AIC<sub>c</sub>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Burnham1">Burnham and Anderson 2002</xref>).

We also did not consider models with &Delta;AIC<sub>c</sub> less than or equal to that of the null model to be competitive. Results from competitive models were model-averaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Burnham1">Burnham and Anderson 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Barton1">Barton 2012</xref>). We present model-averaged coefficients and unconditional 95&percnt; confidence intervals (i.e. &plusmn;1.96 SE) based on all competitive models. Confidence intervals for the mixed-model analysis and associated predictions were based on model-averaged fixed effects only. We considered the inclusion of a covariate in our competitive model set as evidence that it had an influence on nuthatch space use, because for inclusion the &sim;85&percnt; confidence intervals of these covariates should not include zero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Arnold1">Arnold 2010</xref>). We refer to these covariates as &ldquo;less supported&rdquo; if their 95&percnt; confidence intervals overlapped zero. We considered 95&percnt; confidence intervals that did not overlap zero as additional evidence that a given covariate influenced nuthatch space use (hereafter &ldquo;more supported&rdquo;).We present predicted UD heights and home range sizes for all supported covariates. All predictions were limited to the range of observed values for each plotted covariate with all other covariates fixed at their respective mean values. We assessed adequate model fit for the global general linear mixed model relative to a cost-distance null model by ANOVA test (sensu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Rosenberg1">Rosenberg and McKelvey 1999</xref>).

All analyses were conducted in R version 2.15.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-RDevelopmentCoreTeam1">R Development Core Team 2012</xref>).We captured 40 nuthatches and attached transmitters to 30. We excluded 8 radio-tagged birds from analyses because they were either not adequately sampled or were not independent because they were part of the same group. The remaining 22 nuthatches were from different groups and we relocated them 17&ndash;63 times (mean: 42). One group abandoned an incomplete clutch after transmitter attachment and several antennae were preened. No other behavioral effects of transmitter attachment were observed. All groups were territorial and attempted to breed. All groups tracked in 2011 remained in the same home ranges in 2012. Eighteen of 22 groups were composed of &ge;3 members. Our sample was biased in favor of males (15 male, 3 female, 4 unknown). We noted brood patch development in 6 of 15 males.Nuthatch home ranges were in stands with 11&ndash;41&percnt; total tree stocking and 41&ndash;91&percnt; pine (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-t02">Table 2</xref>).

Fourteen of 22 (64&percnt;) nuthatch utilization distributions had two centers of activity, indicating that birds were primarily using two distinct locations. There was no evidence of lack of fit of the global model predicting home range size; the global model was an improvement over the null model and did not exhibit evidence of overdispersion (&Delta; in residual deviances &equals; 8.03, <italic>&ccirc;</italic> &equals; 0.65). Four of the 32 models were competitive for inference (Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-t06">Table 6</xref>). Home range size had a more supported relationship with percent pine and punky snag density, a less supported relationship with percent grassy herbaceous cover, and no apparent relationship with total stocking or fire season (top three models, <italic>w<sub>i</sub></italic> &equals; 0.85; <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-t03">Table 3</xref>).

We found no evidence of lack of fit for the global resource selection model; it was an improvement over the cost&ndash;distance null model that incorporated distance to the nest and the random effect of individual identity but no habitat covariates (&chi;<sup>2</sup><sub>6</sub> &equals; 38.68, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). We fitted 64 third-order resource selection models (Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-t07">Table 7</xref>) and three were competitive for inference (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-t04">Table 4</xref>). Distance from nest, fresh snag density, and years since last fire had a more supported association with nuthatch use, whereas percent pine, total stocking, and grassy herbaceous cover had a less supported association, and fire season had no apparent relationship (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-t05">Table 5</xref>). Fresh snag density, percent pine, and grassy herbaceous cover were positively associated with relative probability of use (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-f03">Figure 3</xref>), whereas use declined with increasing total stocking and years since prescribed fire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-f03">Figure 3</xref>). Resources differed in their apparent importance to nuthatches. For example, the standardized model-averaged coefficient for fresh snags was 2.4 times larger than the same coefficient for total stocking (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-t05">Table 5</xref>).Model rankings relating standardized utilization distribution height at a point (a measure of relative probability of use) to available resources based on 22 Brown-headed Nuthatches in Arkansas, USA, 2011&ndash;2012. <italic>K</italic> is the number of parameters in each model, Loglik is the negative log-likelihood, &Delta;AIC<sub>c</sub> is the difference in corrected Akaike's Information Criterion value for each model from the top-supported model, and <italic>w<sub>i</sub></italic> is the Akaike weight for each model.

Covariates are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-t01">Table 1</xref>.Home range size of Brown-headed Nuthatches was related to punky snags suitable for nesting, pine trees needed for foraging, and grassy herbaceous cover that might influence nuthatch invertebrate prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-James1">James et al. 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Slater2">Slater et al. 2013</xref>). Space use within home ranges was heavily dominated by the influence of a central place, yet several resources were also associated with nuthatch use. Nuthatches avoided areas within home ranges where fire had not occurred and where tree stocking was high, preferring abundant recently killed snags and grassy herbaceous cover. Most nuthatches had two centers of activity within their home ranges. We believe that these activity centers are indicative of centers of foraging activity, because we only recorded locations for nuthatches that were not attending the nest site and nuthatches were nearly always actively foraging when located. The high level of foraging activity that we observed is consistent with the only extant study of the subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Yaukey1">Yaukey 1997</xref>).The distribution of suitable nest sites may limit the carrying capacity of managed pine-bluestem habitats for Brown-headed Nuthatches. For many species, habitat quality can be inferred when there is an apparent relationship between home range size and available resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Gompper1">Gompper and Gittleman 1991</xref>). The resource that we suspected to be limiting, punky snags, had a strong relationship with nuthatch home range size. We hypothesize that the mechanism for this relationship is territoriality; nuthatches may defend a surfeit of cavities throughout the year, which would then be available for future use.We also found support for a relationship between home range size and percent pine. Home ranges decreased 77&percnt; across the range of percent pine. A post-hoc analysis, however, indicated that high punky snag density co-occurred only with low percent pine values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-f04">Figure 4</xref>). This suggests that some of the predicted home range sizes reflect conditions that did not exist in our sample and might not be achievable in managed landscapes. Also, there may be a tradeoff between nest sites and foraging substrates that affects home range selection in nuthatches. Predicted home range size increased 113&percnt; across the range of observed values for grassy herbaceous cover. However, the relationship was in the opposite direction to that hypothesized and the 95&percnt; confidence interval overlapped zero. Grassy herbaceous cover also had a less-supported, weak positive association with nuthatch space use within home ranges (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-t05">Table 5</xref>) and no apparent relationship with nuthatch site occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Stanton1">Stanton 2013</xref>). Overall, the evidence suggests that grassy herbaceous cover may be unimportant to Brown-headed Nuthatches, in contrast to its importance to Red-cockaded Woodpeckers, which are often found in similar fire-maintained habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-James1">James et al. 2001</xref>).Observed mean percent pine within 22 Brown-headed Nuthatch home ranges in Arkansas, USA, 2011&ndash;2012, plotted against mean observed punky snag density. The best-fit line is from a linear regression (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &equals; 0.39, 20 df, SE &equals; 0.02, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01).Resource selection within Brown-headed Nuthatch home ranges was primarily driven by the influence of the nest site, as indicated by the relatively large model-averaged standardized coefficient of log distance to nest and a confidence interval that did not overlap zero (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-t05">Table 5</xref>). However, fine-scale variation in resources also influenced space use by nuthatches as shown by overall model selection results and model-averaged confidence intervals that did not overlap zero for several covariates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-t05">Table 5</xref>). Pine savannahs and woodlands can look very homogeneous to the casual observer. If the configuration of resources in such an environment has a measurable influence, it should be even more important to animals using visibly patchy environments. Likewise, each species has evolved to perceive its environment in a particular way (its <italic>Umwelt</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-VonUexkull1">Von Uexk&uuml;ll 1957</xref>), and it is difficult for us to measure how Brown-headed Nuthatches see their world. As voracious predators of many insect species, nuthatches and small birds generally must be able to perceive the world quite finely indeed. Thus, our results likely underestimate how much resource configuration influences nuthatch movement behavior.We measured several structural vegetation characteristics associated with both nuthatch use and prescribed fire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Wright1">Wright and Bailey 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Wilson2">Wilson and Watts 1999</xref>). Prescribed fire influences vegetation structure; that it was supported in our analyses in addition to vegetation structure is consistent with speculation that prescribed fire may have beneficial effects on the invertebrate prey base. We also found an association between fresh snags and relative probability of nuthatch use. Fresh snags may represent a valuable foraging resource, since they host a variety of beetle larvae and other prey taken by nuthatches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Nesbitt1">Nesbitt and Hetrick 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Ulyshen1">Ulyshen and Hanula 2009</xref>). Further confirmatory study will be needed to determine whether this association has a verifiable, biologically significant link to nuthatch survival and reproduction.The invertebrate prey of nuthatches may also explain why they typically have two centers of activity in their home ranges. All nuthatch utilization distributions had either one or two centers of activity; 64&percnt; had two (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-f01">Figure 1</xref>). Nuthatches were almost invariably foraging when located, so we believe this pattern was likely generated by foraging behavior. Foraging in two distinct locations may be common for nesting passerines, as it is for seabirds (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Jakubas1">Jakubas et al. 2012</xref>). When animals select prey that vary substantially in size or handling time, it may be most efficient to gather them from different locations, focusing on a particular prey type during a given trip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Ydenberg1">Ydenberg and Davies 2010</xref>). Major nuthatch food items include scale insects and wood roaches, which are substantially different in size and likely handling time (Coccoidea, 1&ndash;6 mm; Blattaria, 19&ndash;25 mm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Nesbitt1">Nesbitt and Hetrick 1976</xref>).We did not study prey availability, but wanted to explore post-hoc whether there were any differences between home ranges with one or two centers of activity. We used Welch's <italic>t</italic>-tests and Holm's correction for multiple comparisons to determine whether home ranges differed in size or resource density according to how many centers of activity were present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Welch1">Welch 1947</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Holm1">Holm 1979</xref>). We found that home ranges with two centers of activity had lower mean tree stocking, 24&percnt; versus 32&percnt;, a possible indicator of lower habitat quality for a species that forages on trees (<italic>t</italic><sub>17.2</sub> &equals; 3.1, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.04). However, the difference was small and no other differences were apparent (all <italic>P</italic> &gt;0.05).Our sample was markedly male-biased (&ge;68&percnt;). Male nuthatches are more aggressive and deliver food to incubating females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Slater2">Slater et al. 2013</xref>), making them far easier to capture. However, populations of Brown-headed Nuthatches can be male-biased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Norris1">Norris 1958</xref>). Thus, the bias in our sample may not be entirely attributable to our capture methods. Regardless, sex differences in resource selection can occur and our results may not apply to females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Manly1">Manly et al. 2010</xref>). Likewise, molecular sexing from feathers was unsuccessful in 18&percnt; of cases. Future researchers should investigate improved sexing and capture methods to achieve a more representative sample.Brown-headed Nuthatches have been declining in abundance, with the greatest declines at the southern limits of their range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Sauer1">Sauer et al. 2012</xref>).

While climate projections are both mixed and uncertain, the extent of suitable habitat for nuthatches may increase in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Iverson1">Iverson and Prasad 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Murphy1">Murphy et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Karl1">Karl et al. 2009</xref>). However, nuthatches appear to have poor dispersal ability and there is reason to doubt that recolonization of suitable habitat will occur in places such as the Missouri Ozarks (&sim;400 km northeast of our study area) without human assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Slater1">Slater 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Haas1">Haas et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Stanton1">Stanton 2013</xref>). The findings from this study can be used to identify the extent of suitable habitat in Missouri, informing reasoned discussion on whether translocations should be attempted. Pine woodlands and savannahs require ongoing active management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-407-Wright1">Wright and Bailey 1982</xref>). The relationships that we found support the value of prescribed fire and other active pine restoration efforts for Brown-headed Nuthatches during the breeding season.This study was primarily funded by the USDA Forest Service Northern Research Station, the USGS-funded Northeast Climate Science Center, the Ouachita National Forest, the Audubon Society of Missouri, the Webster Groves Nature Study Society, and the Conservation Foundation of Missouri. W. Montague and the Ouachita National Forest provided advice, direction, and logistical support. The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission provided housing in 2011. A. Carrlson, H. Prelewitz, A. Henehan, and E. Underwood collected field data. C. Rota, R. Gitzen, and W. Dijak provided sample computer code and GIS assistance. J. Faaborg, A. McKellar, and two anonymous reviewers contributed valuable comments that improved this manuscript.
