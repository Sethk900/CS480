Characteristic patterns of QuikScat-based wind stress and turbulent heat flux in the tropical Indian OceanUsing QuikScat-based vector wind data for 1999â2003, surface wind stress and turbulent heat (Q) have been mapped for the tropical Indian Ocean (IO) to understand their seasonal variability. During July wind stress is enhanced by â¼70% in the Arabian Sea compared to that during January. The Arabian Sea experiences a large Q loss (150â200Â W/m2) during the summer and winter monsoons, which is nearly 1.3 times of that in the Bay of Bengal. The southeasterlies are strengthened during the southern hemisphere winter. Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis captures different phases of monsoon-induced variability in wind stress and Q, ranging from seasonal to high-frequency perturbations. Coherency between time coefficients of EOF-1 for wind stress and Q suggests that former leads the latter with a temporal lag of 20â40Â days for period >322Â days. At high frequencies (<21Â days) Q leads wind stress with a temporal lag of 2Â days. Possible explanation for wind stress leading Q over an annual time scale is offered based on the marine atmospheric boundary layer physics and pre-conditioned ocean surface, while on shorter time scales (21Â days) ocean thermodynamics through mixed layer processes cause Q to lead wind stress.
