Properties of ERS-1/2 coherence in the Siberian boreal forest and implications for stem volume retrievalProperties of multi-temporal ERS-1/2 tandem coherence in boreal forests and retrieval accuracy of forest stem volume have been investigated mostly for small, managed forest areas. The clear seasonal trends and the high accuracy of the retrieval are therefore valid for specific types of forest and question is if these findings extend to large areas with different forest types in a similar manner. Using multi-temporal ERS-1/2 coherence data and extensive sets of inventory data at stand level at seven forest compartments in Central Siberia we confirm that the trend of coherence as a function of stem volume is mainly driven by the environmental conditions at acquisition. In addition, we have now found that the variability of the coherence for a given stem volume are due to spatial variations of the environmental conditions, strong topography (slope>10Â°), small stand size (<3â4Â ha) and low relative stocking (<50%). Further deviations can be related to errors in the ground data. Stem volume retrieval behaves consistently under stable winter frozen conditions. For stands larger than 3â4Â ha and relative stocking of at least 50%, a relative RMSE of 20â25% can be considered the effective retrieval error achievable in Siberian boreal forest. Combined with previous experience from managed test forests in Sweden and Finland, C-band ERS-1/2 tandem coherence observations acquired under stable winter conditions with a snow cover and an at least moderate breeze can be considered so far the most suitable spaceborne remote sensing observable for the estimation of forest stem volume in homogeneous forest stands throughout the boreal zone.
