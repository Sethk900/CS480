First Detection of Root Rot and Foliar Blight on Pittosporum (               Pittosporum tenuifolium               ) Caused by               Pythium irregulare               in ItalyDuring 2013, a new root rot and leaf blight was detected on potted Pitto- sporum tenuifolium cv. ‘Silver Queen’ plants in a nursery located in the Catania province (eastern Sicily, Italy). On the basis of morphological and cultural features as well as internal transcribed spacer sequence data, the causal agent was identified as Pythium irregulare. Koch’s postulates were fulfilled by pathogenicity tests carried out on potted P. tenuifolium cv. ‘Sil- ver Queen’ plants. To our knowledge, this is the first detection of P. irregu- lare root rot and foliar blight disease on P. tenuifolium in Europe, and it is the first detection using molecular methods for this oomycete pathogen in Italy.
