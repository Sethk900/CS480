Heifer Performance Under Two Stocking Rates on Fourwing Saltbush-Dominated Rangeland.The efficiency of livestock production in shortgrass steppe may be increased by grazing fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens [Pursh] Nutt)-dominated rangeland in late fall and/or early spring, but there is a paucity of information concerning stocking rates and animal gains. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of light and moderate stocking rates on weight gains of heifers grazing twice-replicated 16-ha pastures in late fall (November to mid-January) from 1996 to 1998, and in early spring (April to mid-May) from 1996 to 1999. Stocking rates for late fall (light: 1.3-1.5 ha/animal unit month [AUM^-1] vs. moderate: 0.8-1.0 ha/AUM) and early spring (light: 3.7-4.0 ha/AUM vs. moderate: 2.3-2.5 ha/AUM) were achieved using 5 (for light grazing) and 8 (for moderate grazing) Hereford heifers, with initial average weights of 405±5.7 (mean±1 SE) kg for the late fall grazing period and 267±3.8 kg for the early spring grazing period across the study years.
