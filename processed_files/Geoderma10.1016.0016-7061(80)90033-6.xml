Mineralogy of a podzol formed in sandy materials in northern Den-  mark. Geoderma, 24: 25--43.    This paper deals with possible mineralogical changes from one particle size fraction to  another and from one horizon to another in a Typic Haplorthod. X-ray diffraction and  chemical analysis were the main methods used. The investigation indicates that a large  part of the fine material in ,the soil is developed during weathering in situ. Less resistant  minerals seem to be protected by being parts of rock fragments in coarser fractions, but  once freed from that protection they quickly undergo fragmentation into finer particles.  Most of the sand and silt fractions are quartz. The K-feldspar content ranges between  about 10 and 20%, the Na-feldspar content from about 15 to 30% and the Ca-feldspar  content is very small. The clay minerals are mostly kaolinite and mica and in the A2  horizon, expandable 2:1 minerals containing both smectite and vermiculite layers. The  B horizon contains 14 A minerals that resemble interstratified vermiculite--chlorite. In  the C horizon both vermiculite--chlorite and chlorite occur.    INTRODUCTION    In earlier work on ten profiles from sandy deposits in northern Denmark,  a general tendency for accumulation of silt and clay-size materials in the  upper part of all the soils was shown (NCrnberg, 1977). To find out whether  this material had been weathered in situ and, if so, which minerals could be  sources of the weathering products, further investigations were carried out  on a profile developed in fluvioglaeial materials. Strongly podzolic conditions  are believed to have prevailed in the profile.    LITERATURE REVIEW    The weathering of primary minerals has been the subject of numerous  studies reported in the literature. It was suggested that cracks in quartz gains  from Miocene sand deposits from The Netherlands, as seen in thin sections of  very small thickness, play an important role in gain-size reduction (Riezebos    26    and Van der Waals, 1972--73). In the light mineral fraction in some podzolized  softs, minerals identified with the polarizing microscope as "chlorite" and  "altered grains" show the clearest evidence of weathering, whereas K-feld-  spars show no such evidence (Franzmeier and Whiteside, 1963). In sandy  deposits in North Carolina the amounts of weatherable minerals, primarily  feldspars, are closely related to the age of the deposits (Smith et al., 1976).  Bronger and Kalk (1976) report results on the role of feldspar in pedogenetic  clay mineral formation, cryoclastic disintegration of micas and feldspars and  the weathering of biotite and its role in clay mineral formation. In softs from  loess no cryoclastic fragmentation could be identified in the silt and coarse  clay fractions, whereas pedochemical processes played a dominant role in  weathering and transformation of layer silicates. The considerable decompo-  sition of feldspar did not result in greater feldspar contents in the silt and  clay fractions and is thus considered to be pedochemical solution of the  feldspar resulting in neoformation of clay minerals (Bronger et al., 1976).  The disappearance of feldspars and ferro-magnesian minerals from the A2  horizons of sandy podzols in Quebec has been reported, as has the decomposi-  tion of coarser materials in the upper horizons and the accumulation of  material in silt and clay fractions (Fedoroff et al., 1977). The sequence of  chlorite, plagioclases and K-minerals (micas and feldspars) is reported to be  the order of weathering in sandy soils in the "Landes du Medoc", France and  the predominant weathering process in the fine silt fraction was fragmenta-  tion of particles (Righi and De Coninck, 1977). Transformation of chlorite  into vermiculite or its complete dissolution in A2 horizons of podzols has  been reported by Schwertman (1976) and Bain (1977). The clay minerals  found in the A2 horizons of sandy podzols are very often more or less  expandable 2 : 1 layer minerals that show little resistance to collapse upon  heating (Franzmeier and Whiteside, 1963; Gjems, 1967; Brydon et al., 1968;  Kapoor, 1973; l~ighi and De Coninck, 1977). In the B horizons, interstratified  minerals that are not expandable but collapse gradually upon heating are  widely reported, but with various names: 2:1--2 : 2 intergrade minerals  (Kapoor, 1973; Malcolm et al., 1969; Jackson, 1963), chloritized montmoril-  lonite (Sawhney and Jackson, 1958) or vermiculite (Conry et al., 1972).  These minerals, or more probably these series of clay minerals with similar  properties, could be considered as products of hydroxy--polymerinterlayering  in 2 : 1 layer silicates or perhaps in some cases chloride degradation products.  In C horizons, kaolinite, mica and chlorite are often present.    MATERIALS AND METHODS    Soil profile    The soil studied is comparable to profile 10 of N~brnberg (1977). According  to the American classification system (U.S.D.A., 1975) it is a Typic Haplorthod.  The soil was developed in sandy fluvioglacial materials of the Weichsel glacia-    TABLE I  Some physical and chemical data for the profile  Particle size distribution (%):  sand                                             silt  2--1 mm     1--0,5 mm   500--250/J  250--125 ~  125--63/~    63--20/~     20-6/~  A2       2.9            6.7          22.1          30.0          17.7          10.2          3.7  B21hir   4.6          6.1        22.8        29.3        15.9         8.9        3.1  B22ir    7.5         12.0        27.9        32.2        13.7         3.1        1.1  IIC       3.5            7.5         17.4         38.2          28.4           2.6          1.0    Bulk     pH    C     Free  clay      density   H20  (%)   Fe203  6--2 ~    ~2 ~t     (g/cm3)                (%)  2.3       4.3       1.02      3.8    3.4    0.56  2.4               4.6               1.19            4.4        4.0        1.25  0.9       1.6       1.70      4.8    1.1    0.50  0.7       0.7         --       5.3    --    0.06    t'O  --3    28    tion at an elevation of 50 m and with a maximum age of about 13,000 years.  The vegetation is heather with some dispersed pine and oak and the terrain is  sloping slightly south-eastwards. The soil has a bleached A2 horizon, 6 cm  thick, covered by an A1, 4 cm thick, and above that an O1 horizon. The  B horizon is differentiated into a B21hir (5 cm) horizon, a B22ir (26 cm)  and a B23ir (26 cm) horizon. According to its particle size distribution the  underlying material can be regarded as a IIC horizon. Horizon designations  are from U.S.D.A. (1975). The main physical and chemical data for the  samples are shown in Table I. The profile was selected because of its advanced  development and because of the homogeneity of the materials in the upper  horizons.    Separation of particle size fractions    The materials used for mineralogical analysis were kept moist and washed  through a 2 mm sieve. Organic matter was destroyed with H~O2. The pH was  kept at the natural level during the peroxidation by addition of 0.5 N NaOH.  After peroxidation the samples were dispersed by raising the pH to 9 by  further addition of NaOH. The samples were then separated into fractions  by sieving materials coarser than 63 pm and sedimenting the finer fractions.  The dispersed suspensions were flocculated with NaC1, washed twice with  0.1 N NaC1 and washed four times with water. The samples were shaken for  10 min between each washing. The sample size was 400 g to get enough  material of the coarsest and finest fractions.    Preparation of sand and silt fractions    The 2--1 mm, 250--125 pm and 63--20 pm fractions used for mineralogical  analysis were separated into light and heavy fractions in bromoform, washed  with acetone and dried. The light fraction was cleaned with hot 2% HCI for  20 sec to remove iron and aluminium oxides. Grains were mounted for  optical examination in Clearax and Canada Balsam. The light fraction used  for X-ray analysis was ground in an agate ball mill for 120 sec.    Total chemical analysis    Chemical analysis was carried out on ground and cleaned samples of the  light fractions by dissolving them in Teflon decomposition vessels with  hydrofluoric acid at ll0 according to the method of Bernas (1968).  Determination of the elements was by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS).  The results shown in Table II are average values from duplicate determinations.  The amounts of quartz and feldspars given in Table III are calculated from  the average composition of feldspars, assuming, from X-ray evidence, that the  contents of other minerals were very small. The chemical composition of  orthoclase (KA1Si308) was used for calculation of K-feldspar, the chemical    29    TABLE II  Chemical composition of light fractions (in %)    Sample     SiO~     A1203   Fe2 O ~   CaO     MgO     K~ O     Na2 O    H2 O     Total    Fraction 2--1 mm (coarse sand)  A2         83.43     8.62   0.52    0.15    0.05     2.91     2,94    0.40    99.02  B21hir     80.38   10.31   0.74    0.22    0.09    3.29    3.10    0.55    98.68  B22ir      75.63   12.14   1.15    0.40    0.20    3.18    3.73    0.70    97.13  IIC        77.26   11.22   0.76    0.23    0.13    3.69    3.11    0.35    96.75    Fraction 250--125 um (fine sand)  A2         86.98    5.16   0.16    0.19    0.02     1.57     1.96     0.48    96.52  B21hir     87.68     5.19   0.18    0.08    0.02     1.57     2.16    0.35     97.23  B22ir     87.82   6.04  0.35    0.12   0.05    1.67    2.56    0.35    98.96  IIC       87.28   6.12  0.24   0.09   0.03    2.02    2.30   0.15    98.23    Fraction 60--20 um (coarse silt)  A2         84.51    7.63   0.55    0.33    0.09    2.17    2.58    0.61    98.47  B21hir     79.49    8.74   1.20    0.39    0.18    2.27    2.65    3.36    98.28  B22ir      74.49   10.19   2.51    0.48    0.43    2.21    2.76    4.28    97.35  IIC        83.33    7.23   1.01    0.31    0.19    2.28    2.36    0.93    97.64    composition of albite (NaA1Si3Os) for calculation of Na-feldspar and  anorthite (CaA12 Si2 08) for Ca-feldspar. The accuracy of the calculations of  quartz and feldspars cannot be relied upon to decimal places. Calculations  were carried to that point, however, so as to permit estimates of remaining  A1203 (column diff. A1203) when all K, Na, Ca and Si has been used for  calculation of amounts of quartz and feldspars.    Pretreatments of &lt;2 #m samples    Part of each &lt;2 pm sample was treated with dithionite-citrate and NaOH  to remove amorphous aluminosilicates, silica, iron and alumina according to  Jackson ('1965) and Hashimoto and Jackson (1960). Parallel samples were  treated with 0.5 N HC1 for I h at 20 and 1 N HC1 for 1 h at 20 or 1 N  HC1 for 1 h at 80. Only the results for the last HC1 treatments are mentioned  in the text. The elements dissolved by these treatments were determined by  AAS.    X-ray diffraction    Na-, Mg- and K-saturated samples were prepared by first washing each  sample twice with a 0.1 N solution of the appropriate chloride and then  four times with water. Ethylene-glycol solvation was done in vacuum with  glycol vapour overnight. Heat treatment of each sample up to 200 was  carried out on a heating stage on the diffractometer. For heating above 200,    30    samples were placed in a muffle furnace and subsequently cooled in a desic-  cator. X-ray diffractometry was done with a Philips diffractometer and  either Cu or Co K radiation was used on powder samples of the light frac-  tions of sand and coarse silt and on oriented samples of the clay and fine silt.    RESULTS AND DISCUSSION    Initial state and homogeneity of the materials    Five fractions were chosen for further investigation, viz., coarse sand,  2--1 mm; fine sand, 250--125 pm, coarse silt, 63--20 #m; medium silt,  20-6 pm; and clay, &lt;2 pro.  The 2--1 mm fractions decreased in quantity from the B22ir horizon to-  wards the top of the profile. In contrast, the amounts of the 250--125 t~m  fractions were nearly equal in the three upper samples whereas the silt frac-  tions clearly increased towards the top (Table I). A third sand fraction  (250-63 um) was also investigated but showed no significant differences  among horizons. The trends found in the described profile can also be seen  in another profile in the same material (profile 9) and in younger profiles  from sandy marine deposits in the same area (N~rnberg, 1977). It was con-  sidered, from the similarities observed by optical microscopy of light and  heavy fractions and from the particle size distribution that at least the A2,  B21hir and B22ir horizons originally had very similar particle size distribu-  tion and mineralogy. The IIC sample possibly has the same mineralogy, as  the source area was the same, but has a different particle size distribution.  Results from profiles examined earlier in the same area show that the amounts  of fine material generally increase uniformly toward the surfaces of profiles  (N~brnberg, 1977). Such a trend is consistent with greater intensity of  weathering near the soil surface than deeper in the profiles.  Studies of aeolian additions to soils and sediments indicate that coarser  materials (&gt;20 pm) transported by air come from local sources, whereas  finer materials (10-1 tim) can be moved over global distance (Syers et al.,  1969; Mokma et al., 1972). Aeolian sediments known to be transported in  Denmark today are nearly all windblown sand. Such sediments are well  sorted with less than 1% of sizes &lt;63 #m and with infinitesimal amounts of  sizes &lt; 20 ~ m. Therefore, it seems highly improbable that the fine fractions  in the soil profile could be the result of aeolian additions.  Ratios between amounts of materials in a pair of size fractions in the A2  and B22ir horizons differ greatly. For the 2--1 mm fraction, the ratio is  1: 2.5. For the 63--20 pm fraction, the ratio is 3:1 (see Table I). Conse-  quently, it is believed that a large share of the coarse sand originally present  has been weathered and broken down into finer sizes. The differing pro-  portions of the size fractions are predominantly in the light minerals inas-  much as only 2--5% of the sand and silt consist of heavy minerals. The light  mineral fraction has therefore been examined more closely.    31    The   coarse sand    X-ray patterns of the 2--1 mm fractions from the four horizons show  mostly quartz and feldspar with some mica (Fig. 1). There are some weak  14 and 7.2 A peaks for the samples from the B22ir and IIC horizons,  probably indicating chlorite. If the intensity of the quartz peak (4.26 )  compared with the feldspar peaks (3.18  3.24 A) is taken as a semi-quanti-  tative measure, it can be seen that the quartz content decreases as compared    //!I B 21hir    /,  i' B22 ir  /  I'    I  /    IIC    d~     1.82                       ~   4.26 5   6.35   10 14    ~15  Fig. 1.

A more quantitative expression for the differ-  ences can be seen in Tables II and III. The tables show further that the  materials are very poor in calcium, magnesium and iron. The downward  increases of Fe and Mg contents from horizon A2 to B22ir (Table II) might  be due to increases of iron-bearing minerals (chlorite). The Na contents  decrease relatively more than the K contents towards the top of the profile  (Table II), which could be taken as indication of higher resistance of K-feld-  spars than Na-feldspar to weathering.

Quartz and feldspar are the only minerals shown  by the diffractograms. This size fraction has much higher quartz contents  than the 2--1 mm fraction (Table III) and its quartz contents increase  slightly upward. The K-feldspar contents are about half of what was found  in the 2--1 mm fraction and the Na-feldspar contents are 8--10% lower. The  decreases in Na-feldspar are clear, whereas differences in K-feldspar are  limited. The 250--125 pm fractions might originally have had a mineral  distribution which, due to sorting processes during deposition, differed from  those of the 2--1 mm fractions. The parent material is fluvioglacial and  clearly water-deposited, but such large differences should not be expected  from sorting processes of light fractions. Examination with an optical micro-  scope shows that a large proportion of the particles in the 2--1 mm fraction  are rock fragments. Quartz and feldspars are components of the rock frag-  ment but some surfaces of the more weatherable feldspars are not exposed.    It is believed that they weather more slowly under these conditions than  they would as individual grains. This seems the most likely explanation for  the relatively smaller quartz/feldspar ratio in the 2--1 mm fractions than in  the 250--125 ~m fractions (Table III).

Cu, Ks, range: 1 103.    34    the edges of particles, seen in thin sections of the 2--1 mm fraction, give the  impression that the particles in the A2 horizon are much more weathered  than those in deeper horizons. The rather equal relative amounts of material  in the 250--125 pm fraction (Table I), the decreases of the coarser fractions  and the increases of the finer ones towards the top of the profile suggest  that the 250--125 pm fraction is close to an equilibrium state; a sort of  dynamic equilibrium where the increase of this fraction due to breakdown of  coarser fragments is balanced by the loss due to further breakdown into  &lt;125 pm size. If it is assumed as an approximation for the 2--1 mm fraction  that the particle size distribution of the B22ir horizon is close to the original  (Table I), as much as half of the 250--125 t~m material in the A2 horizon was  formed from coarser fractions and as much again has decomposed and dis-  appeared through the fine end of this fraction. It is assumed from the  numerous cracks in the 2--1 mm particles from the A2 horizon that the pre-  dominant weathering process here is comminution of particles in which  chemical processes probably play a dominant role in forming the cracks evi-  dent in the thin sections. The quartz contents in the 250--125 pm fraction is  relatively high compared to feldspar, though it might be suggested that the  material added from the coarser fractions has a relatively low quartz/feldspar  ratio. It is therefore believed that disintegration of feldspar in the 250--125  pm fraction has contributed materials to finer fractions.    The coarse silt    In the X-ray traces for the 63--20 pm fraction (Fig. 3) little but quartz  and feldspar were found. There are weak 14 A and 7.2 A peaks for the B22ir  horizon and an 8.4 peak for the IIC horizon. If the 4.26 A peak and the  3.18 A and 3.24 ?~ peaks are compared as semiquantitative expressions of  relative contents, the diffractograms indicate a tendency shown in Tables II  and III for quartz to decrease and feldspar to increase down through the soil.  The quartz contents are lower in the coarse silt fraction than in the fine sand  fraction. If it is assumed that the amount of material in the coarse silt frac-  tion in the B22ir horizon (Table I) is near the original, about 70% of the  material of this fraction in the A2 horizon would have been added through  weathering processes, mostly as feldspar and quartz. As indicated in the  former passage, a relatively large part of the added material is feldspar. Con-  sequently, the Q/F ratio is about half of what is the case in the fine sand  fraction, but still this indicates that the feldspar in the 63--20 t~m fraction  must have a rather high decomposition rate. As the chemical analysis was  carried out on samples after removal of free oxides, increases in Fe and Mg  contents from the A2 to the B22ir horizon can probably be correlated with  iron-bearing clay minerals as indicated by the weak 14 A peak on the X-ray  trace for the B22ir sample.    35    A2    B21hir    f/                        j/i! .22,,  J  f,  l           i    llC    i  d ~,    1.82                      3.33   4.2d    6:3~ 8A   14   '  Z2  Fig. 3.

The medium silt    Comparison of X-ray traces of the medium silt, 20--6 pm, (Fig.4) and the  coarse silt, 63--20 pm fractions {Fig. 3) must be made with caution because  the latter is from a powder mount of the light fraction, the former from a  smear of the whole sample. In the 20--6 ~m fraction there are large contents  of feldspar and quartz, but clay minerals are present, especially in B and C  horizons, in noticeable amounts. In the A2 horizon there is a 10 A mineral  and one with a weak 7.2 A peak. Minerals in the B21hir and B22ir horizons  have well-defined 14 A peaks. The minerals with the 14 A peaks collapse  gradually to 10 A upon heating (not illustrated), and may be termed  vermiculite--chlorite intergrades. The 14 A peak in the IIC horizon collapses  only partially to 10 A upon heating, the remaining 14 A material being  chlorite. The primary minerals, mica and chlorite, observed in the 2--1 mm    36    fraction (Fig. 1) are also seen in the medium silt fraction (Fig.4). They are  not detectable in the fine sand fractions and only sporadic in the coarse silt  fractions. A possible explanation is that these minerals are very easily  weathered once they have lost their protection in rock fragments and are  comminuted quickly through the sand and coarse silt fractions into the  medium silt and finer fractions.    ~'         II     i  , ~        ~iI  '     ~  iI, l!                           /,,i,\_  'i      I                 J' '~  J    A2    B21 hir  B22ir    IIC    d~,  3:33         ~7.'I 8.~ ITo ]~4    ~-    Fig. 4.

Thus, expansion is intermediate between those of smectite and vermiculite.  The Na-saturated mineral collapses easily to 10 A upon heating to 60 and  K-saturation causes collapse to a 10 A peak which broadens on the low-angle  side.

The traces from the IIC horizon (Fig. 8) indicate a 14 A mineral which  collapses incompletely to 10 A upon heating. Mica and kaolinite are more  abundant here than in the B21hir and B22ir horizons. The oxide-free sample  does not have the same type of 14 A minerals as did the previous horizons.  Here there are two minerals, one of which, a vermiculite--chlorite intergrade,  collapses to 10 A upon heating to 500, whereas the other is chlorite which  remains unaffected by heating.  The results of the extractions of free oxides (I), free amorphous silica,  free alumina, and amorphous alumino-silicates (allophane) (II + III) are shown  in Table IV. Large parts of the &lt;2 pm materials consist of free oxides (Table    Mg  IIC             E o    IIC    Mg  Glyc    :                                            Mg  Na                                                       ~"  E.G.    i  /  J  /  i    ,  !   ///  /~// ,/  /    ,,  /   ,  /   /  I ' i  i /t  '  i/~  II  !    /    Na  20C    335    500C    I    Ox.f  Na    Ox.f  Na  E.G.    500    d~                   7.15  1'0 1~4     r           3~3:~       5    Z15 10 I~,.2  a                                                  b   3.57    Fig. 8.

For the A2 horizon, extraction dissolves more than  14% of the sample. Presumably, the dissolved materials are amorphous. The  extractions had no effect on the X-ray traces and the materials removed  might be microcrystalline or amorphous.  The B horizon has the large contents of iron and alumina that are normal  for podzols, whereas the large content of alumina in the IIC horizon is taken  as an indication that the transport processes go at least as deep as that.  The extraction of free and amorphous materials (I + II + III) brings the ex-  tracted materials up to 26--40% in total exclusive of water. It is a useful  procedure for these samples because it clarifies the X-ray patterns. Moreover,  it is not possible from the traces to point out any attack of the crystalline  materials.  An attempt was made to remove the hydroxide interlayer materials from  the intergrade minerals by treating parallel samples with N HC1 at 80. As  can be seen from the X-ray traces (Figs. 5--8) the minerals collapsed more  easily when heated but otherwise were little changed by the treatment. From  Table V it can be seen that the amounts of materials extracted were similar  to that extracted by dithionite-NaOH (Table IV).

The less resistant minerals seem to be protected against  weathering in the coarser fractions because they occur in rock fragments to-  gether with more resistant minerals. The more easily weatherable primary  minerals, chlorite and mica, present in the coarse sand fraction are probably  broken down into fine silt and clay size particles soon after their release from  rock fragments. The dominant share of the clay minerals, the vermiculite--  chlorite intergrades, may be degradation products from chlorite. The strong  weathering conditions in the A2 horizon, indicated by the low pH value, are  believed to be responsible for total solution of the hydroxy interlayers and  the formation of a mineral with a mixture of smectite and vermiculite layers.

AbstractThis paper deals with possible mineralogical changes from one particle size fraction to another and from one horizon to another in a Typic Haplorthod. X-ray diffraction and chemical analysis were the main methods used. The investigation indicates that a large part of the fine material in the soil is developed during weathering in situ. Less resistant minerals seem to be protected by being parts of rock fragments in coarser fractions, but once freed from that protection they quickly undergo fragmentation into finer particles. Most of the sand and silt fractions are quartz. The K-feldspar content ranges between about 10 and 20%, the Na-feldspar content from about 15 to 30% and the Ca-feldspar content is very small. The clay minerals are mostly kaolinite and mica and in the A2 horizon, expandable 2:1 minerals containing both smectite and vermiculite layers. The B horizon contains 14 A minerals that resemble interstratified vermiculiteâchlorite. In the C horizon both vermiculiteâchlorite and clorite occur.
