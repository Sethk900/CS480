Review of the genus Helcystogramma Zeller (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae: Dichomeridinae) from ChinaThe genus Helcystogramma Zeller from China is reviewed. Of the 20 species treated in this paper, nine are described as new: H. imagibicuneum sp. nov., H. flavifuscum sp. nov., H. brevinodium sp. nov., H. albilepidotum sp. nov., H. angustum sp. nov., H. flavistictum sp. nov., H. furvimaculare sp. nov., H. imagitrijunctum sp. nov. and H. rectangulum sp. nov.; six are newly recorded for this country: H. flavilineolella Ponomarenko, H. bicuneum (Meyrick), H. epicentra (Meyrick), H. perelegans (Omelko et Omelko), H. fuscomarginatum Ueda and H. lutatella (Herrich-Sch√§ffer); the previously unknown females of H. epicentra (Meyrick) and H. hassenzanensis Park et Hodges are described for the first time; H. bicuneum (Meyrick) and H. epicentra (Meyrick) are redescribed; and the misidentification of H. trijunctum (Meyrick) is clarified. These species are arranged into five species groups based on the forewing patterns and the genital characters: the flavilineolella group, the hibisci group, the perelegans group, the triannulella group and the trijunctum group. Images of the adults and the illustrations of the male and female genitalia are provided. A key to distinguish the Chinese species and three maps to show the localities of these species are included.
