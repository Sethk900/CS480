Fedundity and breeding sites of an anuran community in a seasonal tropical environmentAt Panguana, a study site in Amazonian Peru, the anuran community consists of 73 species. As evidence of the diversity of this community, the snoutâ€vent length of 48 species ranged from 14.2 mm (Eleutherodactylus carvalhoi) to 180.0 mm (Leptodaclylus pentadactylus) and the ovarian complement of 40 species from 5 (Dendrobates quinquevittatus) to 2431 eggs (Bufo typhonius) (type 1). Seasonality of rainfall at Panguana affected the breeding patterns of the anurans by limiting the availability of aquatic sites. Because of their different modes of reproduction the frogs were unevenly dispersed at these breeding sites. Explosive breeding at the beginning of the rainy season is characteristic for the seasonal environment of Panguana.
