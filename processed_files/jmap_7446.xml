Morphological, zoogeographical and biological aspects of the scolytidae from nothofagus dombeyi in ArgentinaSummary In the years 1971 and 1972 ageneral relevation of the entomofauna of Isla Victoria, Nahuel Huapi National Park, Argentina was encouraged. In a collection of nearly 2000 species of insects, the Scolytidae were represented by 18. The high grade of endemism of the Nothofagus insects made it necessary to describe most of these species (Schedl, 1975). A couple of Corthylini genera, bearing some ancestral remarks, are characteristic of this fauna. The field observations about the samplings are summarized. Three species belonging to two related genera live as cleptic inquilins in the galleries of other Corthylini with similar body width. It is indicated that â€œcleptoinquilinâ€ismâ€; is possibly present also in some other â€œambrosia beetlesâ€; of the Neotropics. Summary
