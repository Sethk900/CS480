Soil metabolic pulses: water, substrate, and biological regulationPulses of metabolic activity are a common ecological response to intermittently available resources, and in soils these pulses often occur in response to wetting. To better understand variation in soil pulses, we conducted a distributed field experiment at seven sites along a 2200-m elevation transect in southern California, USA. Treatments included both water and water + substrate additions and two measurements of soil respiration within one hour. These experiments were repeated 11 times throughout 2009–2010. Additions of substrate led to consistently higher pulse fluxes, exceeding 10 μmol CO2·m−2·s−1, than additions of water alone. These results support a sequential limitation by two resources where an initial limiting resource acts as a switch and, after activation, processes are regulated by a second resource. In contrast to general expectations of increasing pulses with higher soil organic matter (SOM), pulses exhibited strong scale dependencies. Pulses during the summer period and SOM were correlated positively within sites and negatively between sites. This cross-scale divergence implies that, at low elevations, the proportion of SOM available for pulse metabolism was a much larger fraction than at higher elevations. With expected climate changes leading to more frequent drying–wetting cycles, regulation of metabolic pulses will increasingly influence long-term biogeochemical dynamics.
