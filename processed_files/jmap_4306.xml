Azteca Ants as Antiherbivore Agents of Tococa formicaria (Melastomataceae) in Brazilian CerradoSeveral ant species have been found associated with domatia of plant species of the genus Tococa (Melastomataceae). In the present study we investigated the relationships between Tococa formicaria Mart. and ants in the Cerrado (savanna-like vegetation) from central Brazil. We addressed questions about the utilisation of domatia by different ant species and their efficiency in reducing herbivory. We found 8 ant species in the domatia, with Azteca sp. 1 being present in 47.2% of the sampled individuals. The other species found were: Azteca sp. 2, Camponotus sp., Dolichoderus gr. diversus, Dolichoderus lutosus, Leptothorax sp., Oligomyrmex sp. and Linepithema sp. The dominance of Azteca sp. 1 was significantly higher in the larger individuals, with about 85% of individuals in the highest size class being occupied by this species. We performed experiments of attack to live baits (termites) on T. formicaria leaves and on leaves of control species (any other neighbouring plant species of similar size). The recruitment rates were significantly higher on T. formicaria leaves. We also showed that herbivory was significantly lower in T. formicaria individuals occupied by Azteca sp. 1 than in individuals occupied by other ant species. The results of this study may be considered as evidence to support the assumption of a mutualistic relationship through defence against herbivory between Azteca ants and T. formicaria.
