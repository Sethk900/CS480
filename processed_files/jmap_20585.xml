Effects of desiccation and temperature/irradiance on the metabolism of 2 arctic stream bryophyte taxaLong-term (13 y) experimental P enrichment of a 4th-order reach ofthe Kuparuk River (North Slope, Alaska) had little effect on thedistribution, abundance, or metabolism of a common, clump-formingbryophyte (Schistidium [Grimmia] agassizii), but promoted rapidand extensive growth by mat-forming, streamer bryophytes(Hygrohypnum alpestre and H. ochraceum) that formerly were rare inthe river. In previous research we showed that there wereimportant physiological differences (i.e., photosyntheticefficiency) that helped explain why S. agassizii was able topersist in the river under cold, oligotrophic conditions, whereasH. alpestre and H. ochraceum were not. Here we hypothesize that S.agassizii should be more tolerant than Hygrohypnum spp. todesiccation stress, and that Hygrohypnum spp. would take greateradvantage (e.g., greater rates of net primary production) than S.agassizii of elevated temperatures. We did laboratory experimentsusing small-scale metabolism chambers to test this hypothesis.Desiccation affected net photosynthesis more in Hygrohypnum spp.than in S. agassizii. Hygrohypnum spp. had a greater tolerance totemperatures >20 degree C than S. agassizii. Further, netphotosynthetic rates (at light saturation) were significantlyhigher for Hygrohypnum spp. (1676-6342 mu g O2 g-1 dry mass [dm]h-1) than for S. agassizii (428-1163 mu g O2 g-1dm h-1) at alltemperatures measured. In fact, S. agassizii showed minimalresponse to increases in light availability and recovered rapidlyfrom desiccation, but was inhibited by high temperature. Incontrast, Hygrohypnum spp. were susceptible to desiccation, andresponded strongly to increased light and temperature. Thephysiological attributes we measured helped explain thedistribution of our test species in arctic tundra streams.
