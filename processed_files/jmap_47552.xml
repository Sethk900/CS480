Complete mitogenome of Chinese shrew mole Uropsilus soricipes (Milne-Edwards, 1871) (Mammalia: Talpidae) and genetic structure of the species in the Jiajin Mountains (China)The complete mitochondrial genome of the Chinese shrew mole, Uropsilus soricipes (Soricomorpha: Talpidae) was determined (GenBank accession no. JQ658979). The mitogenome is 16,575 base pairs and contains 13 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes and one control region. Phylogenetic relationship analysis based on 12 concatenated protein-coding genes revealed that Uropsilus occupies a basal position within Talpidae, which is consistent with previous studies. Additionally, low nucleotide diversity (0.0028) and high haplotype diversity (0.936) of U. soricipes in the Jiajin Mountains and the neutrality test statistics (D=−1.59491, p=0.045; Fs=−4.171, p=0.016) suggest that this population experienced a demographic expansion at about 46,600 years ago. The phylogenetic analysis of the combined data (cytochrome b and D-loop) revealed two clades. Divergence of these clades occurred in the middle Pleistocene 0.986 million years ago. Mountains played a substantial role in shaping the geographical populations of this species.
