Riparian Butterfly (Papilionoidea and Hesperioidea) Assemblages Associated with Tamarix-Dominated, Native Vegetationâ€“Dominated, and Tamarix Removal Sites along the Arkansas River, Colorado, U.S.A.We studied butterfly assemblages at eight riparian sites over five years. Sites included <em>Tamarix </em>spp.-dominated riparian areas; sites where mechanical means or biological control agents (<em>Diorhabda elongata deserticola</em>) were used to limit <em>Tamarix</em>; sites that were mixtures of native woody vegetation (e.g., <em>Populus </em>and <em>Salix</em>) and <em>Tamarix</em>; and native vegetation sites. We identified a gradient in butterfly community composition that changed from treated <em>Tamarix </em>sites, through mixed vegetation, to native vegetation sites. <em>Tamarix </em>sites had lower butterfly metric (riparian butterfly index [RBI]) values than did native vegetation sites. The RBI is based on a combination of richness measures and the presence of specific species and groups of butterflies. There was no significant change in the RBI over sampling periods at any sites, including both <em>Tamarix </em>eradication sites. The RBI at sites where <em>Tamarix </em>control took place did not approach restoration goals based on values at unimpacted sites. Positive effects on riparian butterfly assemblages were not linked to any <em>Tamarix </em>control efforts, nor did we detect a decline from initial butterfly metrics at <em>Tamarix </em>sites. Direct ordination provided information on environmental variables, such as amount of nectar and herbaceous plant richness, which may be important in riparian restoration efforts.
