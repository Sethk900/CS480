Polymerase Chain Reaction-Based Sex Identification in the Greater Roadrunner.We determined a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method to identify the sex of greater roadrunners (<em>Geococcyx californianus</em>). We found that previously reported primer combinations used in other bird species did not work reliably in roadrunners. However, a novel primer combination (P2-1237L) allowed for consistent and reliable sex identification of roadrunners. Conducting several PCR replicates per sample helped to identify occasional preferential amplification of the Z band that could occur in females (the heterogametic sex; i.e., WZ). Identifying the sex of individuals will allow for examination of sex-associated differences in home range size and habitat use, population demographics, and parenting behavior, as well as for a better understanding of the social system of roadrunners.
