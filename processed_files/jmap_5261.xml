Tropical cyclones and reproductive ecology of Crocodylus acutus Cuvier, 1807 (Reptilia: Crocodilia: Crocodylidae) on a Caribbean atoll in MexicoCrocodylus acutus, a coastal species nesting in sand beaches, could be affected by increasing tropical cyclone frequency. We studied key characteristics of C. acutus reproductive ecology on Banco Chinchorro atoll from 2006 to 2009, including the impact of two tropical cyclones. Hurricanes increased canopy openness causing earlier nesting the following year. Crocodiles nested at the beginning of the wet season with hatching in mid-wet season; this could represent a compromise between risking nest flooding and increasing freshwater availability for hatchlings. Tropical cyclones dramatically reduced nesting success by cooling and flooding clutches. Nursery sites were usually hypersaline, but heavy rainfall from tropical cyclones can likely benefit hatchling survival by decreasing salinity. While tropical cyclones have negative short-term impacts on crocodile nesting, they likely have an overall beneficial effect by creating and maintaining open sandy nesting areas used by C. acutus and they may explain its widespread distribution in Caribbean coastal areas.
