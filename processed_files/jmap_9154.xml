Environmental challenges in Mongolia's dryland pastoral landscapeChanging environmental, economic, and political conditions since 1990 have impacted Mongolian pastoralism. Privatization of livestock, reduced government support, and immediate livelihood needs have affected traditional herding practices and human-environment dynamics. This study examined herder perceptions of major challenges facing pastoralism today. Mongolian herders identified ongoing ecological processes as dominating daily life and actions. Results established that environmental conditions, particularly water resources and pasture quality, were paramount concerns. Transformation to a market economy coupled with limited state assistance over the last 15 years has decreased rural water supplies, reduced mobility, and increased overgrazing, leading to land degradation. Herders specified water availability, variable precipitation, insect invasion, adequate pasture, and extreme winters as the primary pastoral challenges.
