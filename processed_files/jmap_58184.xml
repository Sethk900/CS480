Trend, Independence, Stationarity, and Homogeneity Tests on Maximum Rainfall Series of Standard Durations Recorded in TurkeyAbstractData of 14 standard duration annual maximum rainfall series with durations of 5 min to 24 h and lengths between 30 and 73 years up to 2010 that were recorded in Turkey are used. Mann-Kendall and linear regression trend, von Neumann independence, Wald-Wolfowitz stationarity, and Mann-Whitney homogeneity tests are applied on 155 complete series with a 24-h duration and 23 complete series with 14 standard durations. Next, only the linear regression test is applied on 174 incomplete series of 14 standard durations. The results of these tests indicate that almost 90% of all annual maximum rainfall series are trend free, independent, stationary, and homogeneous at a critical probability of 5%. Finally, the newly proposed Sen’s 1∶1 trend line method is applied to some series and its results are observed to be in agreement with both the Mann-Kendall and linear regression tests. It is concluded that standard duration annual maximum rainfall series in Turkey can be generally treated as independent and identically distributed random variables, which allow conventional intensity-duration-frequency calculations to be performed by statistical frequency analysis.
