This review considers the evidence that ethylene biosynthesis is up-regulated by locally-generated signals in response to a change in external P supply, where the hormone then mediates, with auxin, changes in root system architecture. Subsequent changes in endogenous P evoke systemic responses whereby ethylene again is important in inducing some of the key signature changes observed in P-deprived tissues (eg. phosphate transporter and acid phosphatase up-regulation).  The consideration as to how plants uptake and transport phosphorus (P) is of significant agronomic and economic importance, in part driven by finite reserves of rock phosphate. Our understanding of these mechanisms has been greatly advanced, particularly with respect to the responses of plants to P deficiency and the genetic dissection of the signalling involved. Further, the realization that there are two tiers of transcriptional responses, the local, in which inorganic P (Pi) acts as an external signal independent of the endogenous P level, and the systemic involving root–shoot signalling, has now added a dimension of both clarity and complexity. Notwithstanding, it is now clear that the hormone ethylene plays a key role in mediating both levels of responses. This review, therefore, covers the role of ethylene in terms of mediating responses to P deficiency. The evidence that Pi supply regulates ethylene biosynthesis and sensitivity, and that this, in turn, regulates changes in root system architecture and in Pi-deprivation responses is examined here. While ethylene is the focus, the key interactions with auxin are also assessed, but interactions with the other hormone groups, which have recently been reviewed, are not covered. The emerging view that ethylene is a multi-faceted hormone in terms of mediating responses to P deficiency invites the dissection of the transcriptional cues that mediate changes in ethylene biosynthesis and/or sensitivity. Knowledge of the nature of such cues will subsequently reveal more of the underpinning interactions that govern P responses and provide avenues for the production of germplasm with an improved phosphate use efficiency.  The mechanisms by which plants access sufficient phosphate (P) from the soil are of intense agronomic and academic interest. The chemical form of phosphorus P taken up by plants, orthophosphate (H 2 PO 4  − ; designated as Pi), represents only a small fraction of available (free) P in soils and is generally immobile. However, as a macro-element, relatively significant quantities are required for plant function, and measurement of the Pi content of the aerial and root tissue of plants, when compared with the level in the surrounding soil, suggests that efficient uptake and transport systems do operate in plants. The array of Pi transporters, and their expression, has been reviewed relatively recently ( Raghothama and Karthikeyan 2005 ;  Nussaume  et al.  2011 ), and the determination of the key role of the PHO1 protein has provided significant insight into how plants partition the essential element, in  Arabidopsis thaliana  at least ( Chiou and Lin 2011 ).  Further insight into the mechanisms by which plants uptake and partition phosphate, particularly in terms of changes in root growth dynamics and function, occurs via approaches where phosphate is limiting. In particular, understanding the mechanisms and controls regulating the observed changes in root system architecture (RSA) is an active research field inviting speculation as to how alterations in the levels of both endogenous and exogenous Pi can influence such fundamental (and rapid) changes in growth. In this review, we focus on one aspect of this control: the interaction of Pi level and ethylene biosynthesis and signalling. We examine the emerging view that ethylene may play a role in both modulating RSA and regulating some of the signature cellular changes that accompany the responses of plants to low Pi supply. In terms of RSA, our focus is on changes to primary and lateral root growth. However, it is clear too that root hairs play an important role in Pi acquisition, and while the importance of these structures has been reviewed recently ( Peret  et al.  2011 ), they will not be considered here. In our examination of the role of ethylene, we will look (briefly) at the role of auxin, but beyond that, and while not wishing to undermine the importance of such interactions, we will not consider the interactions with other hormones in any detail. However, the reader is referred to more recent reviews of this topic ( Fukaki and Tasaka 2009 ;  Chiou and Lin 2011 ). Likewise, there is the intriguing Fe/Pi interaction that is emerging ( Ward  et al.  2008 ), and which has been reviewed more recently ( Abel 2011 ), and it is also apparent that ethylene signalling is fundamental in terms of plant responses to low-potassium conditions ( Kim  et al.  2012 ). However, in the space available, we focus on the Pi and ethylene interaction.  The observation that Pi supply can regulate root architecture arose from early considerations that the subtleties of root structure contribute largely to the efficiency of nutrient uptake, particularly for the immobile elements ( Baldwin 1975 ). Subsequently, changes in RSA (compensatory growth) were observed in barley ( Drew 1975 ;  Drew and Saker 1978 ), and in bean and other legumes ( Bonser  et al.  1996 ;  Borch  et al.  1999 ). A summary of changes to the root architecture in bean suggests a root system that undergoes growth responses to maximize top soil foraging, but in tandem with a reduction in the metabolic cost of such soil mining ( Lynch and Brown 2001 ).  More recently, studies have inevitably changed to the model plant species  Arabidopsis.  In addition to the well-known array of genetic resources available, this species has a further advantage for use when dissecting the influence of Pi supply on root growth in that it does not form mycorrhizal associations, so making separation of  in planta  observations more apparent. In comparison with bean,  Arabidopsis  also has a less complex root system when grown from seed over, typically, 14-day time courses. Initial studies using the accession Columbia revealed a signature response to low Pi supply comprising a decreased growth rate of the primary root (PR), in part mediated by a reduction in elongation of cells at the root cap, and an increase in mean lateral root (LR), length ( Williamson  et al.  2001 ). With the decrease in PR length, LR density thus increased and the distance between the root tip and the first emerged LR also decreased in response to the low Pi treatment ( Williamson  et al.  2001 ). The decrease in PR length and an increase in LR density in response to low Pi supply were confirmed in Columbia seedlings by  López-Bucio  et al.  (2002) , with an increase in LR number also contributing. Interestingly, these authors also applied a range of P concentrations and noted a biphasic rather than linear response to P added, particularly in terms of PR length and LR density, perhaps indicating the operation of a ‘threshold’ concentration in terms of the controlling signalling. That these changes represent a re-allocation of resources in  Arabidopsis  was demonstrated by  Al-Ghazi  et al.  (2003) , who showed that the total root length is unchanged (at least over the period measured), and so with the elongation of the PR decreasing, an increase in LR length is apparent. These authors thus summarized a sequence of changes in RSA for  Arabidopsis  in response to low Pi that involves a decrease in PR elongation, an increase in LR elongation rate, a decrease in the initiation of laterals and an increase in the growth duration of LRs ( Al-Ghazi  et al.  2003 ).  With these morphological changes in response to low P established in  Arabidopsis , focus then shifted to understanding the mechanisms by which Pi supply induces these modifications.  Nacry  et al.  (2005)  showed, using a  CycB1::uidA  reporter construct, that the LR stimulation was mediated  via  the activation of existing primordia, while the initiation of new primordia was repressed in roots exposed to low Pi supply. The decrease in PR elongation involved a shift from indeterminate to determinate growth, with the progressive loss of meristematic cells ( Sanchez-Calderon  et al.  2005 ). So, how does a root sense a change in Pi supply?  In earlier work,  Linkohr  et al.  (2002)  were able to show in elegant experiments with nutrient patches that the low P phenotype could be induced or repressed depending on the media through which the root was growing. Indeed, Pi sensing (to trigger reduction of PR elongation) was shown to be resident in the root cap and, significantly, independent of the Pi content of the root ( Svistoonoff  et al.  2007 ). The emergence of the concept of Pi as a signal had been proposed earlier by Ticconi and colleagues when they showed that application of the phosphate analogue, phosphite, could repress a range of P-starvation responses including transcriptional changes in P-starved seedlings of  Arabidopsis  ( Ticconi  et al.  2001 ).  In terms of transduction of the Pi signal in  Arabidopsis ,  Ticconi  et al.  (2004)  identified the  pdr2  locus that is disrupted in Pi sensing, but importantly application of phosphite was able to rescue the mutant phenotype demonstrating that PDR2 was involved in sensing the external Pi availability. Subsequent characterization has determined that PDR2 interacts with LOW PHOSPHATE ROOT 1 (LPR1) in  Arabidopsis , a regulator previously identified by  Svistoonoff  et al.  (2007)  as being important in the root tip Pi response ( Ticconi  et al.  2009 ). The mechanism so revealed suggests that PDR2, in  Arabidopsis  at least, is required for the correct expression of SCARECROW (SCR), a regulator of stem cell maintenance in roots, and thus provides a signalling pathway in which local Pi sensing can lead to the switch from indeterminate to determinate growth in the PR tip as previously reported by  Sanchez-Calderon  et al.  (2005) .  This role for Pi as a signal was extended in terms of documenting transcriptional changes accompanying local Pi sensing. Using split-root approaches,  Thibaud  et al.  (2010)  were able to show in  Arabidopsis  that a (low) external Pi, irrespective of internal Pi levels in the root, could influence the transcription of a cluster of genes, designated the locally regulated genes, while a low internal Pi level influenced the transcription of another cluster, designated the systemically regulated genes. Of the genes analysed, the majority were either locally induced (73%) or repressed (68%) and these genes tended to encode proteins involved in hormone biosynthesis and signalling and in stress responses. The systemically induced genes were involved in Pi uptake, mobilization and recycling, suggesting that the changes in external Pi perceived by the plant roots initially elicit a general stress response to perhaps sensitize the plant to any subsequent longer-term nutrient stress. Interestingly, while internal Pi was essential to evoke the systemic response, reducing the flow of Pi into the root did not, suggesting that a Pi-independent signalling system is operating, such as the  PHO2  mRNA regulator, mir399, which is important in coordinating the response. Further,  Thibaud  et al.  (2010)  were also able to show that the systemically induced genes were marked by the possession of the PiBS motif, a target for the PHR1 transcription factor, while repressed genes do not contain the motif. While  PHR1  itself is only marginally induced by Pi starvation, mutation of the P1BS site impairs P responsiveness, but does not influence responses to other stresses (e.g. wounding) ( Bustos  et al.  2010 ). The dissection of such internal signalling events in  Arabidopsis , particularly with respect to shoot-to-root communication, including the key roles of sucrose and MiR399, has been well reviewed recently ( Nilsson  et al.  2010 ;  Yang and Finnegan 2010 ;  Chiou and Lin 2011 ).  The other major player in the control of RSA is auxin. The hormone has long been proposed to be a major regulator from the early pea root decapitation experiments of  Wightman  et al.  (1980) . More recent evidence of a role for auxin arose from  in vivo  studies using developmental mutants of  Arabidopsis  ( Boerjan  et al.  1995 ) or using factors that influence endogenous auxin transport ( Reed  et al.  1998 ). Thus the interaction of Pi status, changes in RSA and the role of auxin is worthy of record, and a number of studies, primarily in  Arabidopsis , have implicated the hormone (L ópez-Bucio  et al.  2002 ;  Al-Ghazi  et al.  2003 ;  Nacry  et al.  2005 ;  Jain  et al.  2007 ;  Perez-Torres  et al.  2008 ;  Miura  et al.  2011 ). Of these,  López-Bucio  et al.  (2002)  used an array of auxin transport and signalling mutants of  Arabidopsis  and concluded that low P served to increase the sensitivity of the roots to respond to auxin in terms of inducing the signature changes in RSA. Using a similar panel of mutants,  Nacry  et al.  (2005)  concluded that changes in auxin distribution/transport and/or synthesis may underpin these changes such that in low P, an over-accumulation of auxin in the PR represses elongation but activates existing LR primordia and the emergence of the laterals, while a decrease in auxin in the elongation zone decreased the formation of new lateral primordia. In support of this,  Miura  et al.  (2011)  transformed mutants of the SUMO E3 ligase (SIZ1) of  Arabidopsis  that had an enhanced Pi response with  DR5p::uidA  and determined that the auxin accumulated earlier both in the PR tip (to decrease growth) and in the lateral primordia (to activate growth) in the  siz1  background when compared with wild type. Interestingly,  Miura  et al.  (2005 ) had shown previously that SIZ1 interacts with PHR1, a global regulator of the systemic Pi responses ( Bustos  et al.  2010 ;  Thibaud  et al. , 2010 ), and the  siz1  mutant was shown to have elevated Pi levels. In terms of mechanism,  Perez-Torres  et al.  (2008)  looked at how this change of sensitivity may be mediated and concluded that Pi deprivation increases the expression of  TIR1  and the action of auxin then stimulates the degradation of the Aux/IAA repressors, thus sensitizing the tissue to auxin.  Prior to a discussion as to how low Pi supply and ethylene interact to influence RSA, it is pertinent to review how the hormone influences root growth in P-supplied roots. The involvement of ethylene as a regulator of root growth has been well established since the early experiments of  Smith and Russell (1969)  with roots of barley. More recent evidence with  Arabidopsis  includes perturbations that can regulate ethylene evolution, such as a mutation in the Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase, CULLIN3, which leads to the stabilization and thus accumulation of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase 5 (ACS5), and an up-regulation of ethylene biosynthesis. In these plants, repression of PR elongation is observed ( Thomann  et al.  2009 ). A general consensus thus exists whereby lower concentrations of the hormone can promote root extension, while higher concentrations are inhibitory for growth ( Jackson  et al.  1981 ;  Jackson 1991 ), so underlining the biphasic action of ethylene in regulating many aspects of vegetative growth ( Pierik  et al.  2006 ).  The role of ethylene in regulating RSA, and how this is mediated  via  auxin, is also well established. In the PR of  Arabidopsis , it is clear that ethylene is stimulating auxin biosynthesis in the root tip, where the higher concentration that ensues inhibits growth, and also a redistribution to the elongation zone ( Ruzicka  et al.  2007 ;  Swarup  et al.  2007 ;  Strader  et al.  2010 ). For the PR of  Arabidopsis , some details as to the downstream mechanism of inhibition are emerging, which suggests that ethylene may work  via  auxin by increasing the cellular concentration of the hormone to a level that inhibits the auxin target H + -pumping ATPases so maintaining apolastic alkalinization. Ethylene may also increase ROS production that stimulates hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein cross-linking which, acting in concert with alkaliniation, will serve to reduce the extensibility of the wall ( Staal  et al.  2011 ).  Ethylene also regulates the initiation of LR primordia and LR outgrowth, again controlled  via  auxin biosynthesis and distribution ( Ivanchenko  et al.  2008 ;  Negi  et al.  2008 ). In  Arabidopsis , higher ethylene concentrations were observed to inhibit the ability of the pericycle to initiate new root primordia although the hormone did promote the emergence of existing primordia ( Ivanchenko  et al.  2008 ). Supporting evidence for the requirement for ethylene also arises from studies in which a mutant of  Arabidopsis  with a lesion in a member of the RING domain-containing ankyrin repeat subfamily of E3 ligases, XBAT32, resulted in ACS accumulation, an increase in ethylene biosynthesis and the production of fewer LRs in the  xbat32  background ( Prasad  et al.  2010 ). In terms of the mechanism of action of ethylene in LR formation in  Arabidopsis , one proposed role for the hormone is to up-regulate the expression of  PIN3  and  PIN7  resulting in increased auxin transport and the lack of establishment of a sufficient local auxin concentration to initiate new LR primordia ( Lewis  et al.  2011 ). For a detailed account of the interaction between auxin and ethylene and the initiation and control of root growth and RSA, the reader is referred to the comprehensive review by  Muday  et al.  (2012) . However, of more pertinence to this review is the emerging view that P status regulates RSA architecture through documented changes in auxin biosynthesis and transport which is controlled ultimately  via  ethylene biosynthesis and/or signalling.  Given the pertinence of the links between auxin signalling, phosphate supply and a role for ethylene, there have been few documented studies where investigators have measured ethylene levels in P-starved roots, and few in general on the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis in P-starved or P-supplied roots. Notably,  Tsuchisaka and Theologis (2004)  examined the differential expression of  ACS  genes in P-supplied roots of  Arabidopsis , while  Gallie  et al.  (2009)  examined the tissue-specific expression of both  ACS  and  ACC oxidase (ACO)  genes in the elongating P-supplied root of maize and concluded that ethylene production was limiting for root elongation, particularly the ACS isoform,  ZmACS6 . In terms of ethylene and altered P supply,  Drew  et al.  (1989) , using maize in hydroponic culture, excised apical segments of emerged adventitious roots and noted that ethyene evolution, ACC levels, and ACO and ACS activity decreased, leading to the conclusion that P-starvation-induced aerenchyma formation was not directed by ethylene. In careful experiments with bean,  Borch  et al.  (1999)  determined that P deficiency did not result in increased ethylene evolution at the root zone, although if the total root dry weight was compared, then an increase was noted in the low P treatment (to reflect the decreased total root mass). In tomato, low P treatment significantly increased ethylene production from the shoots, but decreased it in the roots, and while adventitious roots produced more ethylene, a significant decrease was noted in response to low P supply ( Kim  et al.  2008 ). In this study, the ethylene evolution values are expressed on a per fresh weight (FW) basis, which may accentuate the differences given that lower FW values were again recorded for both shoots and roots in the P-deprived treatments.  The multi-gene ACO family displays differential expression in roots in response to the low Pi treatment. The effects of P treatment [1 mM, P+ (-•-); 10 µM, P− (-▪-)] on the expression, as determined by qPCR, of  TR-ACO1  (A) and  TR-ACO2  (B) in the roots of wild-type white clover harvested at the time intervals indicated. The  *  indicates significant differences between treatments ( P ≤ 0.05); † indicates significant differences within a treatment from day 0.  The key impetus for the investigation of changes in ethylene biosynthesis in response to P supply has been to characterize how the hormone does influence RSA in a P-starved tissue. Historically, approaches have progressed from the application of the hormone to the roots (often as added ACC), to the use of both ethylene biosynthesis and action inhibitors through to mutant backgrounds that are compromised in either ethylene signalling or P response. In earlier work,  He  et al.  (1992)  showed in maize that low P did not induce a perceptible increase in ethylene production, but it did result in sensitizing the tissues to exogenously applied ethylene in terms of the induction of aerenchyma formation. In bean,  Borch  et al.  (1999)  showed that inhibiting ethylene biosynthesis with aminoethoxyglycine (AVG) abolished the documented low-P-induced changes to RSA. However, these workers also determined that the response to ethylene was, more correctly, determined by tissue and P supply such that in the PR, ethylene promotes growth in low P and inhibits it in sufficient P. Likewise, in the determination of LR density, ethylene decreases density in low P ( Borch  et al.  1999 ). These results in bean have been summarized by  Lynch and Brown (2001)  in which they proposed that P availability affects ethylene responsiveness that operates conversely in PR growth and LR density. Thus, in bean, an increase in measured ethylene concentration growth in low P stimulated the growth of the PR and decreased LR frequency.  In  Arabidopsis  too,  Ma  et al.  (2003)  measured the rate of PR elongation and concluded that while the rate is decreased in low P, ethylene is important for the maintenance of root elongation and further that the roots are more sensitive to ethylene in the low P media [as determined by the use of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) and AVG]. These studies highlight that ethylene production  per se  is one aspect of the role of the hormone, but sensitivity is equally important (and may be the ultimate regulator). In tomato and Petunia, the use of ethylene-insensitive mutants and the measurement of ethylene production allowed  Kim  et al.  (2008)  to conclude that, in these species at least, low P did not cause an increase in ethylene production, and so the changes in RSA measured were orchestrated  via  changes in sensitivity. Likewise, in the pasture legume white clover,  Dinh  et al.  (2012)  showed that ACC added to roots maintained in low P induced a ‘super-stimulation’ of LR number and mean LR length when compared with the stimulation induced by the low P treatment alone.  To examine the mechanism by which ethylene may alter root growth, albeit  via  an increased sensitivity to the hormone,  Chacon-Lopez  et al.  (2011)  examined the P-induced cessation of PR growth in  Arabidopsis  utilizing a QC marker. They noted that the previously observed consumption of the root meristem in the P-deficient treatment was abolished if either AVG or silver ions (Ag 2+ ) were added. Further, if ACC was added to the P-sufficient media, consumption of the meristem was again observed although this did not proceed to completion, suggesting that ethylene does not act alone. However, the addition of jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene did promote complete meristem consumption, implying that the rapid changes in RSA may have similarities to broad stress-associated responses. Finally,  Yu  et al.  (2012)  characterized the  hypersensitive to Pi starvation 4 (hps4)  mutant of  Arabidopsis , a background that displays an exaggerated response in terms of RSA, and found it to be allelic to  SABRE , a previously characterized gene that regulates cell expansion. A link with ethylene signalling in the P response was established when it was shown that added Ag repressed the observed increase in severity of phenotype in low P. Interestingly, these workers also observed that the mutant accumulated a higher auxin content in the apical 5 mm root tips as well as displaying an increased expression of auxin-biosynthesis-associated genes in harvested seedlings, leading the mechanism back to the phenomenon described in this review of ethylene-induced changes in auxin biosynthesis and signalling.  It is now accepted that the influence of P-induced ethylene biosynthesis or signalling and changes in RSA is mediated, at one level,  via  the ethylene interactions with auxin. However, auxin does not induce the expression of the phosphate-starvation inducible (PSI) genes, and so the focus of research has shifted more recently to examining the possible other roles of ethylene in terms of inducing the PSI genes and influencing activity.   Lei  et al.  (2011)  characterized the  hypersensitive to phosphate deprivation 2 (hsp2)  mutant of  Arabidopsis  that displays an exaggerated response to Pi deficiency including increased inhibition of PR growth and a more marked induction of  AtPT2  expression. The mutation is allelic to the  CTR1  gene, suggesting that the phenotype was due to increased ethylene biosynthesis. Therefore to look at the role of ethylene more directly in terms of the regulation of PSI gene expression,  AtPT2  expression was characterized in the  etr1-1  and  ein2-5  mutant backgrounds and found not to be increased in response to low P, while induction of  AtPT2  expression was observed in the  eto1-1  background ( Lei  et al.  2011 ). To more directly examine the role of ethylene in the induction of  AtPT2 , these workers also showed that added ACC could induce  AtPT2  expression in low-P-treated plants, but not in the P-sufficient treatment, so underlining that low P sensitizes the plant to respond to ethylene. For the acid phosphatase (Apase) enzyme, root surface activity was highest in the  hps2  mutant, followed by wild type with very little induction in the  ein2-5  background in response to low P. Using another mutant of  Arabidopsis ,  Wang  et al.  (2012)  characterized  hypersensitive to phosphate starvation 3  ( hps3 ) and showed that it was a mutation in the  ETO1  gene, thus giving an ethylene ‘on’ phenotype. In common with other studies, these workers showed that treatment of the mutant with either AVG or Ag 2+  abolished the exaggerated root growth phenotype observed in response to low P treatment. Further, they also showed that there was an induction of root surface Apase (but not total Apase) and an induction of several PSI genes examined in the mutant that could also be abolished if treated with AVG and Ag 2+ .  In other species,  Li  et al.  (2011)  showed that for  Medicago falcata , transfer of plants from high to low P medium caused a decrease in Pi content in the roots that could be abolished if the plants were treated with AVG or Co 2+  (to inhibit ACO activity). Also, if plants that are maintained in high P are treated directly with ACC, then the Pi content of the roots decreases, an observation that was supported by examination of the expression of a higher-affinity transporter  MfPT1  that was up-regulated by Pi deficiency and reversed by AVG and Co 2+ . In common with  Arabidopsis , surface Apase was stimulated in roots of P-sufficient plants treated with ACC, while the induction of activity in the P-deficient medium was abolished by AVG treatment. Taken together, these results do support the contention that ethylene may have pleiotropic effects in terms of mediating the responses of plant roots to P deficiency, and it is likely that further roles will be identified in the future.  Overview of the proposed dual role of ethylene in  Arabidopsis  in response to low Pi supply. The summary is predicated on the key observation that the occurrence of the hormone is a local response to changes in external Pi and involves increased biosynthesis (e.g. up-regulation of  AtACO4 ;  Thibaud  et al.  2010 ) and/or increased sensitivity (e.g. up-regulation of  AtERF  genes;  Thibaud  et al.  2010 ). These local changes in ethylene concentration/sensitivity then interact with auxin to mediate changes to RSA. Any ensuing changes in P status of the leaves evoke a second tier of changes, the systemic responses, whereby the hormone induces, but independent of auxin, a series of key signature changes to P depletion including the up-regulation of acid phosphatases and phosphate transporters.  A second series of events, the systemic responses, are denoted by changes in the Pi-deprivation metabolic responses caused by complex root–shoot–root signalling and are reflective of changes in the endogenous Pi levels. More recently, ethylene, in a mechanism apparently independent of auxin, has been shown to also induce many of these changes (summarized in Fig.  2 ), but it is not yet clear whether a distinct series of systemic cues induce ethylene production and/or changes in ethylene sensitivity ( Nagarajan and Smith 2012 ). Thus it is important to look further at the nature of the transcriptional cues that regulate ethylene biosynthesis and perception.
