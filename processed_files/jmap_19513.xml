N fertilization affects on soil respiration, microbial biomass and root respiration in Larix gmelinii and Fraxinus mandshurica plantations in ChinaThe response of belowground biological processes to soil N availability in Larix gmelinii (larch) and Fraxinus mandshurica (ash) plantations was studied. Soil and root respiration were measured with Li-Cor 6400 and gas-phase O-2 electrodes, respectively. Compared with the control, N fertilization induced the decreases of fine root biomass by 52% and 25%, and soil respiration by 30% and 24% in larch and ash plantations, respectively. The average soil microbial biomass C and N were decreased by 29% and 42% under larch stand and 39% and 47% under ash stand, respectively. While the fine root tissue N concentration under fertilized plots was higher 26% and 12% than that under control plots, respectively, the average fine root respiration rates were increased by 10% and 13% in larch and ash stands under fertilized plot, respectively. Soil respiration rates showed significantly positive exponential relationships with soil temperature, and a seasonal dynamic. These findings suggest that N fertilization can suppress fine root biomass at five branch orders (< 2 mm in diameter), soil respiration, and soil microbial biomass C and N, and alter soil microbial communities in L. gmelinii and F. mandshurica plantations.
