Seasonal variation of soil respiration in a Pinus cembra forest at the upper timberline in the Central Austrian AlpsSoil respiration (R) of a 95-year-old Pinus cembra L. forest at the alpine timberline was measured continuously from October 2001 to January 2003 with an automated multiplexing gas exchange system. There was significant spatial variability in soil respiration, and R at a soil temperature of 10 degreesC (R-10) decreased by about 20% m(-1) with increasing distance from the trunk. Needle litter and fine root density also decreased. The spatially averaged annual Soil CO2 efflux was 35 g C m(-2) year(-1) in 2002. About 70% of the temporal variation in soil respiration could be explained by variations in soil temperature, whereas the influence of soil water potential and thus soil water content was negligible because soil water availability was supra-optimal.
