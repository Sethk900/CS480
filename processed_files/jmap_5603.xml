Polydora and related genera (Polychaeta: Spionidae) from the Grand Caribbean regionThe study of previously unidentified material of Spionidae from the Grand Caribbean region resulted in the discovery of five new species in four genera: Boccardia salazari sp. nov., Dipolydora anatentaculata sp. nov., D. contoyensis sp. nov., Polydora quintanarooensis sp. nov. and Pseudopolydora floridensis sp. nov. Boccardia salazari is characterized by two types of major spine in chaetiger 5, one with expanded end bearing cusps without bristles, the other, simple, falcate; D. anatentaculata is characterized by an occipital antenna, and major spines simple, falcate, without subterminal protuberance; D. contoyensis is characterized by six pairs of branchiae on chaetigers 11â€“16, major spines with two large accessory teeth on concave and convex sides in chaetiger 5, and pygidium small, glandular, cuffâ€shaped with dorsal notch; Polydora quintanarooensis is characterized by two eyes, modified spines of chaetiger 5 falcate, with a lateral tooth, and gizzardâ€like structure present at segment 16, and Pseudopolydora floridensis is characterized by two types of major spines in chaetiger 5, first falcate, second pennoned, with both types arranged in Uâ€shaped, double row, a caruncle extending to chaetigers 6â€“7, and an occipital antenna. A key to all species of Boccardia, Dipolydora, Polydora and Pseudopolydora from the Grand Caribbean region is provided.
