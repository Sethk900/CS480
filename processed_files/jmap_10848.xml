Scientific reticence and sea level riseI suggest that a â€˜scientiï¬c reticenceâ€™ is inhibiting the communication of a threat of a potentially large sea level rise. Delay is dangerous because of system inertias that could create a situation with future sea level changes out of our control. I argue for calling together a panel of scientiï¬c leaders to hear evidence and issue a prompt plain-written report on current understanding of the sea level change issue.
