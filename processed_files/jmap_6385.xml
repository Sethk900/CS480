Implications of Chalara elegans resistance in groundnut breedingGenetic advances in six important traits in the groundnut, including resistance to C. elegans, were determined in field trials conducted at the Vaalharts Research Station during 1988/89 using a randomized block design. Results indicated that significant genetic advances for the traits are possible. Breeding lines with resistance to C. elegans were identified. There were also improvements in yield and grading quality characteristics. Furthermore, it was indicated that direct selection on the primary character should be used in selecting for improved resistance to C. elegans, but that yield and grading quality could be improved by using as selection criteria both the primary character and indirect selection of the related secondary characters.
