The world famous aromatic resin Frankincense is tapped from natural populations of  Boswellia  trees. Most of these populations have been shrinking rapidly over recent decades. To help guide conservation efforts for imperilled species of this genus, we developed 46 genetic markers for  Boswellia papyrifera . Several of these were cross-transferable to other  Boswellia  species that occur in Ethiopia and Yemen. We also identified genes involved in the biosynthesis of the terpenes and terpenoids that are major constituents of frankincense.  Microsatellite (or simple sequence repeat, SSR) markers are highly informative DNA markers often used in conservation genetic research. Next-generation sequencing enables efficient development of large numbers of SSR markers at lower costs.  Boswellia papyrifera  is an economically important tree species used for frankincense production, an aromatic resinous gum exudate from bark. It grows in dry tropical forests in Africa and is threatened by a lack of rejuvenation. To help guide conservation efforts for this endangered species, we conducted an analysis of its genomic DNA sequences using Illumina paired-end sequencing. The genome size was estimated at 705 Mb per haploid genome. The reads contained one microsatellite repeat per 5.7 kb. Based on a subset of these repeats, we developed 46 polymorphic SSR markers that amplified 2–12 alleles in 10 genotypes. This set included 30 trinucleotide repeat markers, four tetranucleotide repeat markers, six pentanucleotide markers and six hexanucleotide repeat markers. Several markers were cross-transferable to  Boswellia pirrotae  and  B. popoviana . In addition, retrotransposons were identified, the reads were assembled and several contigs were identified with similarity to genes of the terpene and terpenoid backbone synthesis pathways, which form the major constituents of the bark resin.  To implement an effective conservation programme, it is essential to understand the genetic structure of endangered populations and the dynamics of genetic variation over space and time ( Karp  et al.  1997 ;  Burczyk  et al.  2006 ;  González-Martínez  et al.  2006 ;  Frankham  et al.  2010 ;  Nybom  et al.  2014 ). Microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers have been widely applied in quantifying the level of genetic variation and its spatial organization, describing the demography and history of populations, and analysing the gene flow and parentage in plants and animals (e.g.  Arens  et al.  2007 ;  Smulders  et al.  2008 ;  Primmer 2009 ;  Allan and Max 2010 ). These repeats are abundant in the genome, polymorphic and multi-allelic (thus highly informative), have co-dominant inheritance (allowing a direct measurement of heterozygosity), and markers based on them are frequently transferable across related species ( Chase  et al.  1996 ;  Smulders  et al.  1997 ,  2001 ;  Brondani  et al.  1998 ;  Pastorelli  et al.  2003 ;  Tuskan  et al.  2004 ;  Selkoe and Toone 2006 ;  Allan and Max 2010 ;  Fan  et al.  2013 ).  Recently, next-generation sequencing technologies have simplified generating large amounts of sequences at affordable cost, thus facilitating the development of molecular markers, including SSRs and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) ( Edwards  et al.  2011 ;  Ekblom and Galindo 2011 ;  Castoe  et al.  2012 ;  Smulders  et al.  2012 ;  Lance  et al.  2013 ;  Vukosavljev  et al.  2015 ), as well as chloroplast sequences for phylogeographical studies ( Van der Merwe  et al.  2014 ). The development of markers has thus become feasible also for species for which no prior sequence information exists ( Smulders  et al.  2012 ), including understudied but economically important crops ( Zalapa  et al.  2012 ).  Marker development can be based on short-length sequences from genomic DNA sequences or cDNA (RNA-seq). Both sets of reads are useful, but they differ with regard to further data mining. RNA-seq data can be  de novo  assembled into a (partial) transcriptome ( Yang and Smith 2013 ) with some caveats, partly related to the assembler used ( Shahin  et al.  2012 ). A common denominator appears to be that multiple assemblers need to be compared ( Nakasugi  et al.  2014 ), but the final result can be compared with the transcriptome of other species. In contrast, it is not straightforward ( Vicedomini  et al.  2013 ) to assess the quality of a  de novo  assembly of short reads of genomic DNA from a species for which no prior sequence information is available, especially if the genome is large and contains many repeats, and the species is heterozygous or even polyploid. Nevertheless, many studies are based on genomic DNA, as it is easier to extract DNA from dry material of wild species collected in the field (on silica gel) than to try to extract good quality RNA from fresh samples or from samples specifically prepared for RNA extraction. What additional information can be reliably extracted from a single library of short reads of genomic DNA is an open question.   Boswellia papyrifera  is currently the number one frankincense-producing tree species in the world ( Coppen 2005 ). Frankincense is an aromatic resinous gum exudate produced from the bark of trees. Its economic value in the world market stems from its use as an ingredient in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and as a church incense ( Groom 1981 ;  Tucker 1986 ;  Lemenih and Teketay 2003 ). In Ethiopia, besides its value in the national economy, it has a significant contribution in the local livelihoods, providing up to one-third of annual household income, especially in the northern regions of the country ( Lemenih  et al.  2003 ,  2007 ;  Woldeamanuel 2011 ).  The population size of  B. papyrifera  is declining in Ethiopia ( Abiyu  et al.  2010 ;  Groenendijk  et al.  2012 ;  Tolera  et al.  2013 ), Eritrea ( Ogbazghi  et al.  2006 ) and Sudan ( Abtew  et al.  2012 ). Little or no tree regeneration occurs in its natural range and mortality of adult trees increases. Despite its endangered status and economic importance, very few conservation efforts exist and none are supported by genetic information. The later situation results because genetic markers for the species have not been developed.  In the present study, we applied the Illumina paired-end sequencing technology to sequence genomic DNA of  B. papyrifera  with the goal of identifying microsatellite repeats and developing SSR markers. The reads were also assembled into the first genomic resource for this species, and we present a couple of structural and functional analyses on them.   Boswellia papyrifera  is one of the six  Boswellia  species that grow in various parts of Ethiopia. The  B. papyrifera  genotype used for Illumina paired-end sequencing was collected from a natural population at Kafa Humera Wuhdet (14.05265N latitude; 37.13078E longitude) in north-west Ethiopia. Young leaves were collected from growing shoot tips of the plant and preserved in silica gel while in the field and during transportation to the laboratory for DNA extraction. A genomic DNA library for Illumina paired-end sequencing was prepared from 4 µg of DNA following the PCR-based gel-free illumina TruSeq DNA sample prep protocol and sequenced as 2 × 100 nt paired-end reads on an Illumina HiSeq at Greenomics, Wageningen UR, Wageningen, the Netherlands.  For testing of the SSR loci a set of 12 genotypes were used. Ten of the genotypes represented populations of  B. papyrifera  collected from 10 different regions of Ethiopia. Two genotypes of  Boswellia pirrotae  and  B. popovina  were included for testing the cross-transferability of the markers to closely related species. The  B. pirrotae  sample was from the northwestern part of Ethiopia.  Boswellia popoviana  is endemic to Socotra Island, Yemen, and the dried leaf sample was obtained through the Edinburgh Royal Botanical Garden, UK.  Total DNA was isolated from silica-dried young leaves following the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide protocol of  Fulton  et al.  (1995) . As large amounts of phenolic compounds were expected because of the resin content in the leaves, the protocol was modified by the addition of 2 % pvp-40 to the extraction buffer and 1 % mercaptoethanol to the microprep buffer of  Fulton  et al.  (1995) , added immediately before use. The extraction was followed by purification steps using DNeasy (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands) according to  Smulders  et al.  (2010) . DNA yield and quality were visually assessed on a 1 % agarose gel.  The raw reads were error-corrected using musket ( Liu  et al . 2012 b  ). This error-corrected set was used for the repeat assembly. Prinseq-lite 0.20.04 ( Schmieder and Edwards 2011 ) was used for quality control and filtering of reads (minimum read length of 50 nt, minimum average base quality of 25, maximum ambiguous nt (N) of 1) after which the data were used for SSR mining. After low complexity trimming (minimum DUST score of 7 for removal of low complexity reads and removal of duplicate reads, also with Prinseq-lite), paired-end reads with overlapping sequences were connected using connecting overlapped pair-end ( Liu  et al.  2012 a  ) in the full mode. Reads were filtered for chloroplast sequences by mapping the reads against the closest chloroplast genome available, which is one of  Citrus sinensis , using bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg 2012 , settings -D 20 -R 3 -N 1 -L 20 -i S,1,0.50 -a).  Reads from the highly repeated fraction of the genome were extracted and assembled using RepARK (REPetitive motif detection by Assembly of Repetitive k-mers;  Koch  et al.  2014 ). The motifs present in the repetitive contigs were counted and analysed by blastn (e-value 1e-5) against Repbase v19.08 (database of repetitive DNA elements,  Jurka  et al.  2005 ).  A  de novo  draft assembly was created from the filtered reads using SOAPdenovo 2.21 ( Li  et al.  2010 , settings -K 41 -M 3 -d 4). The gaps emerging during the scaffolding process by SOAPdenovo were closed using GapCloser (vs. 1.12). The contigs &gt;1000 bp of the draft assembly were analysed and functionally annotated using Blast2GO ( Conesa  et al.  2005 ).  Five million of the filtered but not assembled reads were analysed with PAL_FINDER 0.02.03 ( Castoe  et al.  2012 ) to identify SSRs using slightly adjusted criteria: at least six contiguous repeat units for dinucleotide repeats, four for tri- and tetranucleotide repeats and three for penta- and hexanucleotide repeats ( Castoe  et al.  (2012)  used six units for trunicleotide repeats). Following  Castoe  et al.  (2012)  the reads with multiple SSR loci were considered a ‘compound’ repeat if the SSRs had a different repeat motif, but a ‘broken’ repeat if the SSRs had the same motif. Reverse-complement repeat motifs (e.g. TG and CA) and translated or shifted motifs (e.g. TGG, GTG and GGT) were grouped together, so that there were a total of four unique dinucleotide repeats, 10 unique trinucleotide repeats and so on.  A subset of over 70 000 trinucleotide to hexanucleotide repeat-containing reads was used to further screen potentially amplifiable SSR loci (PALs): loci for which PCR primers could be designed. Primer designing followed the default parameters specified in Primer3 ( Rozen and Skaletsky 2000 ). The reads were then screened for differences in lengths of those sequences that contained these primers (as in  Vukosavljev  et al.  2015 ). At these loci the sequenced plant may be heterozygous, thus indicating that the locus is polymorphic. These formed the group of potentially polymorphic loci.  Forty-six polymorphic microsatellite markers developed for  B. papyrifera  and their cross-transferability to  B. pirrotae  and  B. popoviana .  1 A = number of alleles in 10  B. papyrifera  genotypes.  2 Ho = observed heterozygosity (a tentative figure, as the 10 individuals are from 10 different populations.  3 Amplification was also tested in one individual of  B. pirrotae  (Br) and one of  B. popoviana  (Bv) except where no Bv is indicated. Hom = homozygous and Het = heterozygous, always with products in the same size range as the alleles in  B. papyrifera , except where noted that they were out of range. No ampl = no amplification.  Genomic DNA of one  B. papyrifera  individual was sequenced in order to obtain a library to mine for microsatellite repeats. One lane on an Illumina HiSeq produced 143 458 368 raw reads. Based on k-mer counts, the estimated genome size of  B. papyrifera  was 705 Mb, sequenced at 36× coverage. After error correction and filtering reads for short sequences, sequences with ambiguities (Ns) and low complexity, and excluding redundant sequences, 120 479 203(84 %) paired-end reads and 10 851 777 single-end reads remained.  The 20 most frequent SSR motifs obtained, sorted according to frequency.  A total of 136 SSR loci (117 randomly picked and 19 loci predicted to be potentially polymorphic as they appeared to have two different alleles in the sequence reads) were tested for amplification and degree of polymorphism in 10 randomly chosen individuals from different populations. Of the 117 randomly picked loci, 82 primer pairs amplified a high-quality PCR product, of which 37 (45 %) were polymorphic with a banding pattern that could be scored clearly (Table  1 ). Of the 19 primer pairs predicted to be polymorphic, 13 amplified bands of which 9 loci (69 %) were polymorphic, indicating a significantly higher rate of polymorphism  (χ  2   test, P   &lt;  0.005) compared with randomly picked loci. The final set of 46 markers included 30 trinucleotide repeat markers, 4 tetranucleotide repeats, 6 pentanucleotides and 6 hexanucleotide repeats. The number of alleles across the polymorphic loci varied between 2 and 12 with an average value of 4.8 alleles in 10 genotypes. Several of the polymorphic markers with 10–12 alleles were TTC repeats. The heterozygosity per locus ranged widely from 0.10 to 0.89 (average 0.43). It is possible that, when used in larger populations, these markers will show higher estimates of Ho, and additional alleles may be found.  As shown in Table  1 , most of the SSRs successfully amplified in  B. pirrotae  and  B. popoviana  (in the latter species the amount of DNA was insufficient to test all markers). Amplification, even if it is in the same size range as the alleles in  B. papyrifera , is not proof that the marker is polymorphic, but heterozygosity (two different alleles in the expected range) is. Based on that criterion at least 19 of the 46 markers are polymorphic in  B. pirrotae  and at least 8 of 33 tested are polymorphic in  B. popoviana .  The Illumina reads are the first genomic resource generated in the genus  Boswellia . The repeat fraction was assembled based on k-mer frequency. This produced 49 576 contigs of repeats that were present at least 50× (median length 139 bp, mean length 224 bp, N50 238 bp, maximum length 21 153 bp, total sum = 574 Mbp). Next, 1533 contigs had blastn hits with RepBase, mostly with Copia (639 hits) and Gypsy (523) retrotransposons, alongside EnSpm (114), hAT (72), Satellite (29), TY (23), Harbinger (16), YPrime (14), Helitron (12) and SCTRANSP (3). Intermixed with these elements were hits to the ribosomal RNAs (LSU 56 hits, SSU 41) and also to Caulimoviridae viruses (11).  Representation of ontology assignments of the  B. papyrifera  contigs. (A) The 31 086 GO terms of cellular components, (B) the 42 423 GO terms of molecular function and (C) the 54 256 GO terms of biological processes. Note that these are overlapping classes.   Assefa  et al.  (2012)  conducted a biophysical and chemical study on resins of  Boswellia  species with special emphasis on  B. papyrifera . Using the list of identified components, eight contigs of the assembly were found, which represent part of genes of the terpene synthesis pathways, namely pinene synthase, limonene synthase (2×), isoprene synthase (4×) and gamma-terpinene synthase.  MEP/DOXP and mevalonate pathway genes found among the contigs of  B. papyrifera .  We have developed the first set of 46 SSR markers for  B. papyrifera.  The markers amplified between 2 and 12 alleles in individuals from 10 different populations across Ethiopia. We based the marker development on DNA sequences from one individual. Most of the markers tested were chosen randomly, but the subset for which we assessed, from the sequence reads, that they probably had two alleles in this individual, gave a significantly higher success rate compared with the randomly chosen ones. This assessment is a technically easy screening step that would improve the efficiency of marker development in an outbreeding species, even if only sequences from one individual have been generated, as is often the case. It is probably not as efficient as a strategy that generates transcriptome sequences from multiple individuals with the specific aim of testing only those loci on gel for which polymorphisms in repeat length exist among the reads obtained from these individuals ( Vukosavljev  et al.  2015 ).  The SSR markers were developed based on a set of Illumina paired-end DNA sequence reads from young leaves of a single individual of  B. papyrifera . The distribution of these reads indicated a genome size of 705 Mb. This is close to the estimate of 682 Mb for  B. serrata , the only  Boswellia  species listed in the Kew Gardens C-value database.  Mobile elements that are present in multiple copies in the genome were analysed based on sequence homology in k-mers that occurred at high frequency ( Koch  et al.  2014 ). We have identified a series of retrotransposons, the most common being Copia and Gypsy elements. As these elements are present in large numbers, our Illumina reads probably were a sufficiently good source to determine the presence and relative frequency of various elements.  We also assembled all reads of our paired-end short-read library and obtained 307 Mb of unique sequences. The quality of this assembly is difficult to assess without other independent sources such as libraries of different insert sizes, and we therefore did not compare the results of various assemblers (as, e.g.  Shahin  et al.  2012  did) or merged assemblies ( Vicedomini  et al.  2013 ). Our resource was searched for genes that are expected to be involved in production of the major compounds of the resin, which in  B. papyrifera  includes diterpenes, triterpenes and nortriterpenes ( Basar 2005 ;  Assefa  et al.  2012 ;  Bekana  et al.  2014 ). The contigs of our assembly gave significant hits for most genes of the core terpene and terpenoid pathways. We have not carried out an in-depth analysis of the sequences in these contigs, as extracting the complete  Boswellia  homologues of these genes would need more bioinformatics steps and independent validation, e.g. by PCR and Sanger sequencing. However, the results indicate that for many genes of interest at least partial sequence information is present.  Genetic information is one of the several tools that facilitate the management of populations and support efforts to conserve threatened species ( Moran 2002 ;  Edwards  et al.  2011 ). The newly developed SSR markers generated here for  B. papyrifera  can be applied for characterizing the genetic diversity, population structure and processes within populations, such as pollen and seed dispersal distances, information which may assist in identifying conservation units for the species. A study of the population differentiation of  B. papyrifera  across Ethiopia using a subset of these SSR markers is ongoing (Addisalem  et al. , in prep.). The cross-amplification and polymorphism of the SSR markers in the other two  Boswellia  species,  B. pirrotae  and  B. popoviana,  indicate their potential use for genetic studies of these species and possibly also in other  Boswellia  species.  Boswellia popoviana  is declining and vulnerable in Yemen.  The sequence data generated form the start of a valuable genomic resource for various applications, including estimating the past and present demographic parameters, phylogenetics and phylogeography. With regard to ‘conservation genomics',  McMahon  et al.  (2014)  suggested that genomic sequences are particularly suited to study local adaptation. For most of these applications, genomic sequences need to be generated from several individuals from different populations. This would complement genetic differentiation studies with neutral molecular markers such as SSRs. An exception is the estimation of the the effective population size from SNP density data based on the differences between the alleles at many loci of the heterozygous tree (e.g.  Halley  et al.  2014 ).  Based on Illumina paired-end sequences, we have developed a set of polymorphic SSR markers for  B. papyrifera  and two sister species, which will be useful for studying genetic diversity within and differentiation between  Boswellia  populations. We also generated the first genomic resource in  Boswellia .  Accession number in ENA/GenBank for the set of DNA sequences on which the SSR markers were developed: ERS403283.
