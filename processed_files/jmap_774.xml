Do predator and prey foraging activity patterns match? A study of coyotes (Canis latrans), and lagomorphs (Lepus californicus and Sylvilagus audobonii).Many aspects of an animal's ecology are associated with activity patterns. One important and controversial one is in the predator/prey relationship. We examined temporal patterns of coyotes (Canis latrans) and lagomorphs (Lepus californicus, Sylvilagus audobonii), their main prey in the Chihuahuan Desert. We test the hypothesis that a predator and prey will have non-random distribution of activity relative to each other; this non-random activity could be a substantial overlap or the lack of synchrony depending on the competing theories. We used GPS collars to track coyotes; we identified areas of activity and determined daily patterns. We installed lagomorph feeding stations and game cameras in coyote activity areas to assess lagomorph patterns. All three species were mainly crepuscular. Black-tail jackrabbits and Audubon's cottontail rabbits had different hourly patterns of activity (P < 0.001). Activity peaks for jackrabbits occurred between 0400-0700 h, and 1800-2000 h. Cottontail rabbit activity peaks occurred between 0500-0700 h, and 1800-2000 h. The coyote evening activity peak was synchronous with lagomorph activity, but the morning peak occurred from 0700 to 1000. We found partial lack of synchrony in the activity patterns of the predator and its prey.
