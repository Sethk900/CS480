Effects of nutrient additions on ecosystem carbon cycle in a Puerto Rican tropical wet forest.Wet tropical forests play a critical role in global ecosystem carbon (C) cycle, but C allocation and the response of different C pools to nutrient addition in these forests remain poorly understood. We measured soil organic carbon (SOC), litterfall, root biomass, microbial biomass and soil physical and chemical properties in a wet tropical forest from May 1996 to July 1997 following a 7-year continuous fertilization. We found that although there was no significant difference in total SOC in the top 0-10 cm of the soils between the fertilization plots (5.42±0.18 kg m<sup>-;2</sup>) and the control plots (5.27±0.22 kg m<sup>-;2</sup>), the proportion of the heavy-fraction organic C in the total SOC was significantly higher in the fertilized plots (59%) than in the control plots (46%) (<em>P</em><0.05). The annual decomposition rate of fertilized leaf litter was 13% higher than that of the control leaf litter. We also found that fertilization significantly increased microbial biomass (fungi+bacteria) with 952±48 mg kg<sup>-;1</sup>soil in the fertilized plots and 755±37 mg kg<sup>-;1</sup>soil in the control plots. Our results suggest that fertilization in tropical forests may enhance long-term C sequestration in the soils of tropical wet forests.
