The physical significance of soil mottling in a Wisconsin toposequenceNatural moisture regimes were determined during three seasons by measuring groundwater levels and matric potentials in soils of a representative toposequence in Wisconsin. Detailed field descriptions of soil-mottling features in these soils were made to expand the current physical interpretation of soil mottling which associates occurrence of mottles with chromas of two or less with saturation of the soil during some period of the year. Occurrence of high chroma colors inside peds, ped mangans and few iron cutans or nodules, was associated with very short periods of saturation of one day or less, not predicted when using current criteria. Occurrence of chromas of two inside peds, ped ferrans and neoferrans and few manganese cutans or nodules was associated with short periods of saturation not exceeding a few days. However, high matric potentials (low pF values) near saturation occurred for several months. Occurrence of chromas of one inside peds, ped and channel neoalbans and virtual lack of manganese cutans and nodules was associated with periods of continuous saturation for several months. Use of the detailed Brewer system for describing soil morphological features allowed more detailed judgements as to the duration of soil saturation than was possible using the current system (Soil Survey Staff, 1970).
