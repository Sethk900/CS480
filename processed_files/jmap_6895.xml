New Molecular and Morphometric Evidence for the Validation of Eupsophus calcaratus and E. roseus (Anura: Leptodactylidae) in ChileMolecular, morphometric, and distributional data are used to establish the taxonomic identity and differentiation of the South-American leptodactylid frogs Eupsophus calcaratus and E. roseus. Their geographical distribution in Chile suggests that the differentiation of these species occurred allopatrically. Molecular and morphometric data indicate a clear taxonomic identity of both taxa.
