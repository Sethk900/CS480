Impacts of Hurricane Frances on Florida scrub-oak ecosystem processes: defoliation, net CO2 exchange and interactions with elevated CO2.Hurricane disturbances have profound impacts on ecosystem structure and function, yet their effects on ecosystem CO<sub>2</sub> exchange have not been reported. In September 2004, our research site on a fire-regenerated scrub-oak ecosystem in central Florida was struck by Hurricane Frances with sustained winds of 113 km h<sup>-;1</sup> and wind gusts as high as 152 km h<sup>-;1</sup>. We quantified the hurricane damage on this ecosystem resulting from defoliation: we measured net ecosystem CO<sub>2</sub> exchange, the damage and recovery of leaf area, and determined whether growth in elevated carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere (<em>C</em><sub>a</sub>) altered this disturbance. The hurricane decreased leaf area index (LAI) by 21%, which was equal to 60% of seasonal variation in canopy growth during the previous 3 years, but stem damage was negligible. The reduction in LAI led to a 22% decline in gross primary production (GPP) and a 25% decline in ecosystem respiration (<em>R</em><sub>e</sub>). The compensatory declines in GPP and <em>R</em><sub>e</sub> resulted in no significant change in net ecosystem production (NEP). Refoliation began within a month after the hurricane, although this period was out of phase with the regular foliation period, and recovered 20% of the defoliation loss within 2.5 months. Full recovery of LAI, ecosystem CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation, and ecosystem respiration did not occur until the next growing season. Plants exposed to elevated <em>C</em><sub>a</sub> did not sustain greater damage, nor did they recover faster than plants grown under ambient <em>C</em><sub>a</sub>. Thus, our results indicate that hurricanes capable of causing significant defoliation with negligible damage to stems have negligible effects on NEP under current or future CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched environment.
