Prior studies have shown that the expression of both CNGC19 and CNGC20 genes are induced by salinity and biotic stress. In this report, CNGC19 and CNGC20 were determined to localize to the vacuolar membrane. Co-expression of CNGC19 and CNGC20 increased the efficiency of vacuolar localization. CNGC19 and CNGC20 are, therefore, vacuolar membrane channels that are hypothesized to mediate plant response to salinity and biotic stress.Plant cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs) are implicated in the uptake of both essential and toxic cations, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling, and responses to biotic and abiotic stress. The 20 CNGC paralogues of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> are divided into five evolutionary groups. Group IV-A is highly isolated and consists only of two closely spaced genes, <italic>CNGC19</italic> and <italic>CNGC20</italic>. Prior studies have shown that both genes are induced by salinity and biotic stress. A unique feature of CNGC19 and CNGC20 is their long hydrophilic N-termini. To determine the subcellular locations of CNGC19 and CNGC20, partial and full-length fusions to GFP(S65T) were generated. Translational fusions of the N-termini of CNGC19 (residues 1–171) and CNGC20 (residues 1–200) to GFP(S65T) were targeted to punctate structures when transiently expressed in leaf protoplasts. In the case of CNGC20, but not CNGC19, the punctate structures were co-labelled with a marker for the Golgi. The full-length CNGC19-GFP fusion co-localized with markers for the vacuole membrane (αTIP- and γTIP-mCherry). Vacuole membrane labelling by the full-length CNGC20-GFP fusion was also observed, but the signal was weak and accompanied by numerous punctate signals that did not co-localize with αTIP- or γTIP-mCherry. These punctate structures diminished, and localization of full-length CNGC20-GFP to the vacuole increased, when it was co-expressed with the full-length CNGC19-mCherry. Vacuole membrane labelling was also detected <italic>in planta</italic> via immunoelectron microscopy using a CNGC20-antiserum on cryopreserved ultrathin sections of roots. We hypothesize that the role of group IV-A CNGCs is to mediate the movement of cations between the central vacuole and the cytosol in response to certain types of abiotic and biotic stress.Plants have evolved several distinct classes of transporters and channels to facilitate the movement of cations across cellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C32">Mäser <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). The members of the plant cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (CNGC) family are evolutionarily and structurally related to Shaker-type K<sup>+</sup> channels, but are typically permeable to a range of monovalent cations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C27">Leng <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C6">Balagué <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C21">Hua <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C17">Gobert <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C12">Christopher <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>).

In plants, CNGCs are present at both the plasma membrane (PM) and the membrane of vacuoles. The subcellular localization of CNGCs has primarily been accomplished through the use of chimeric fluorescent reporter proteins. Fluorescent protein fusions indicate that at least four of the six CNGCs belonging to group I are targeted to the PM: CNGC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C17">Gobert <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>), CNGC10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C12">Christopher <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>) and CNGC11 and CNGC12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C7">Baxter <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). CNGC18, a pollen-specific member of group III, was shown to localize to a region of the PM near the tip of expanding pollen tubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C10">Chang <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C16">Frietsch <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). The group II members, CNGC7 and CNGC8, are also expressed exclusively in pollen, but localize to the tonoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C10">Chang <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). The subcellular distribution of CNGCs has been studied in a few cases by immunolocalization. Using paralogue-specific antibodies, CNGC5 (group II) was detected at the PM of leaf protoplasts by immunofluorescence microscopy, and CNGC10 was shown by high-resolution immunoelectron microscopy to pass through the secretory pathway and localize to the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C12">Christopher <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). In contrast, no experimental information is available on the subcellular localizations of CNGC19 or CNGC20. Protein sorting algorithms predict that CNGC20 resides in the chloroplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C40">Sherman and Fromm 2009</xref>).

We demonstrated that both channels are targeted to vacuolar membranes. Our findings suggest that group IV-A CNGCs mediate plant responses to salinity and pathogen infection by facilitating the movement of cations between the central vacuole and the cytosol.Subcellular localization predictions for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CNGCs were performed using TargetP v1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C36">Nielsen <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>).

Genes encoding putative group IV-A CNGCs were identified from the sequenced genomes of <italic>Oryza sativa</italic>, <italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic>, and <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> by BLASTP searches, with CNGC19 and CNGC20 serving as the query sequences. The poplar homologues, designated here as PtCNGC-IVa1, PtCNGC-IVa2 and PtCNGC-IVa3 (GenBank: EEE95941.1, EEF07751.1 and EEF07752.1, respectively), and the rice homologue OsCNGC-IVa1 (GenBank: BAD16877.1) were obtained using the NCBI BLAST server, while the moss homologue PpCNGC-IVa1 (COSMOSS v1.6: Pp1s204_120V6) was identified by a Phytozome BLAST search.

The GFP(S65T) fragment was amplified from plasmid HBT95::sGFP(S65T)-NOS with primers GFP/NdeI (5′-CACCGACTAGT<underline>CATATG</underline>GTGAGCAAGGGCGAG-3′) and GFP/BstEII (5′-TACAG<underline>GGTCACC</underline>TTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATG-3′). <italic>CNGC19</italic> was amplified from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (ecotype Col-0) genomic DNA using the PCR primer pair CNGC19/NcoI.F (5′-TAAA<underline>CCATGG</underline>CTCACACTAGGACTTTCACT-3′) and CNGC19/NdeI.R (5′-ATCA<underline>CATATG</underline>ACGGTTGGAATTGGAGTGAG-3′), while <italic>CNGC20</italic> was amplified using primers CNGC20/NcoI.F (5′-TGGTCAAG<underline>CCATGG</underline>CTTCCCACAACGA-3′) and CNGC20/NdeI.R (5′-AATAC<underline>CATATG</underline>AAGGCTATAACTAGACTGAG-3′).

It was necessary to ligate the <italic>CNGC20</italic> amplicon sequentially as two separate fragments due to the presence of an internal NdeI site. Green fluorescent protein fusions to the N-terminal regions of CNGC19 and CNGC20 were developed as described above, except that the CNGC19<sub>N1</sub> fragment was obtained using the primer pair CNGC19/NcoI.F and CNGC19(D86)/NdeI.R (5′-TTGAA<underline>CATATG</underline>ATCATCTTCAGGTGGAAC-3′), CNGC19<sub>N2</sub> using primers CNGC19/NcoI.F and CNGC19(V166)/NdeI.R (5′-GTCCA<underline>CATATG</underline>AACAAATTTGGAATGAGGA-3′), CNGC20<sub>N1</sub> using primers CNGC20/NcoI.F and CNGC20(E117)NdeI.R (5′-TTCAA<underline>CATATG</underline>CTCATCCTCTGAGGAGTT-3′) and CNGC20<sub>N2</sub> using primers CNGC20/NcoI.F and CNGC20(V200)/NdeI.R (5′-GTCCA<underline>CATATG</underline>AACCTCTTTGGCATGAGGA-3′).

The new plasmids were generated by digesting the binary plasmids G-rk, PX-rk and vac-rk (respectively) with SacI and HindIII, and mobilizing the reporter gene cassettes between the corresponding restriction sites of pBluescript KS(+). The tonoplast marker construct, pBL(35S:<italic>αTIP</italic>-<italic>mCherry</italic>), was generated by amplification of the full-length genomic DNA sequence of <italic>AtαTIP</italic> (<italic>At1g73190</italic>; also referred to as <italic>AtTIP3;1</italic>) with primers αTIP/XbaI.F (5′-AAGT<underline>TCTAGA</underline>TCATAATGGCAACATCAGCTC-3′) and αTIP/BamHI.R (5′-GTTC<underline>GGATCC</underline>GTAATCTTCAGGGGCCAAG-3′), and subsequent ligation of the PCR product between the SpeI and BamHI sites of pBL(35S:<italic>γTIP-mCherry</italic>). The plastid envelope marker pBL(35S:<italic>NTT2</italic>-<italic>mCherry</italic>) was created in a similar manner, using primers NTT2/SpeI.F (5′-GTGCT<underline>ACTAGT</underline>GAGATAGAGAGATGGAAGGT-3′) and NTT2/BamHI.R (5′-ATCAT<underline>GGATCC</underline>AATGCCAGTAGGAGTAGATTTCT-3′) to amplify the genomic DNA sequence of <italic>AtNTT2</italic> (<italic>At1g15500</italic>). <italic>pBL(35S:NTT2-GFP)</italic> was created by digesting <italic>pBL(35S:NTT2-mCherry)</italic> with KpnI and NcoI, and cloning the 3.1-kb fragment containing the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter and <italic>AtNTT2</italic> genomic DNA sequence between the KpnI and NcoI sites of <italic>pBL(35S:GFP(S65T))</italic>.

For standard transfections involving only one reporter construct, 20 μL of ∼1 μg μL<sup>−1</sup> plasmid DNA were added per 200 μL of protoplasts suspended in MMg solution (0.4 M mannitol, 15 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM MES, pH 5.7). In cases where protoplasts were simultaneously co-transfected with two reporter constructs, a 20-μL mixture containing ∼10 μg of each plasmid was utilized. After transfection, the protoplasts were incubated in W5 solution (154 nM NaCl, 125 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM MES, pH 5.7). Samples were analysed 18+ hours post-transfection with an Olympus FV-1000 laser scanning confocal microscope. For mitochondria staining, the protoplasts were incubated in W5 solution containing 0.5 µM MitoTracker Orange CMTMRos (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) 30 min prior to analysis. The excitation/emission filters utilized for fluorescence detection were 488/505–525 nm for GFP(S65T), 543/585–615 nm for mCherry and MitoTracker Orange, and 633/650 nm for chlorophyll autofluorescence. Confocal microscopy was performed at the Biological Electron Microscope Facility (University of Hawaii, Manoa, HI, USA).An affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against a unique region of CNGC20 (residues 664–678, sequence Ac-CLERSSVNPDGTRIR-amide) by New England Peptide (Gardner, MA, USA).

The sections were washed in PBST and then incubated with a 10-fold dilution of the CNGC20 primary antiserum or the rabbit pre-immune serum (negative control). After washing, a 25-fold dilution of secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 15 nm gold particles (Ted Pella, Inc.), was added for 2 h at room temperature. Sections were washed and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. All observations were performed using a Philips CM10 microscope (Philips, Hillsboro, OR, USA).

Not all of the punctate structures labelled by the Golgi marker were co-labelled by CNGC20<sub>N2</sub>-GFP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLT012F9">9</xref>C), possibly indicating that CNGC20<sub>N2</sub>-GFP is only targeted to, or accumulates within, a subset of Golgi.Detection of CNGC20 at vacuolar membranes by immunoelectron microscopy.

A 15 nm gold–anti-rabbit secondary antibody is used in all labelling.In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the CNGC phylogenetic tree consists of 20 members, of which CNGC19 and CNGC20 are the sole members of subgroup IV-A. They are distinguished among CNGCs by their long and novel conserved N-termini, yet retain key features common to all CNGCs such as the overlapping cyclic nucleotide- and calmodulin-binding domains of the C-terminus, six predicted membrane spanning domains and a close resemblance to Shaker-type K<sup>+</sup> channels. To better understand the roles that CNGC19 and CNGC20 play in regulating cation fluxes in plants, we investigated their subcellular locations using the leaf mesophyll protoplast transient expression system. Although the conserved hydrophilic N-termini of CNGC19 and CNGC20 are predicted to contain chloroplast transit peptides, translational fusions of GFP with CNGC19 or CNGC20 did not localize to chloroplasts. We instead found that CNGC19<sub>FL</sub>-GFP and CNGC20<sub>FL</sub>-GFP co-localized with markers for the vacuole membrane (αTIP-mCherry; γTIP-mCherry) when simultaneously expressed in protoplasts.Under our experimental conditions, αTIP- and γTIP-mCherry typically did not appear to label the limiting membrane of the large central vacuole. This is consistent with previous studies showing that epitope-tagged or fluorescent protein-tagged versions of αTIP, δTIP and γTIP strongly label relatively small elliptical structures when transiently expressed in protoplasts or cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C37">Park <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C22">Kim <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C39">Saito <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). These structures may represent either small vacuoles or ring-like extensions of the central vacuole membrane that are referred to as vacuole ‘bulbs’. Vacuolar bulbs were first identified in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> transgenic plants stably expressing γTIP-GFP under the CaMV 35S promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C38">Saito <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). The intensity of γTIP-GFP fluorescence in bulbs is ∼3-fold higher than that in the limiting membrane of the central vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C38">Saito <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>), and their formation is correlated with the fusion of small vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C39">Saito <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). It is speculated that vacuolar bulbs may serve as a reservoir of membranes to facilitate the rapid expansion or transformation of vacuoles or plant response to salt stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C38">Saito <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C9">Boursiac <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>), or as specialized subregions of the vacuole where hydrolytic activities are localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C38">Saito <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C49">Zheng and Staehelin 2011</xref>). In addition to labelling bulb-like structures, CNGC19<sub>FL</sub>-GFP and CNGC20<sub>FL</sub>-GFP occasionally co-localized with short, non-elliptical membranes of intense vacuole marker fluorescence. We hypothesize that these co-labelled membranes correspond to regions of the tonoplast where vacuole bulbs were unfolded to expand the limiting membrane of the central vacuole.Protoplasts expressing CNGC20<sub>FL</sub>-GFP frequently exhibited punctate GFP fluorescence that partially co-localized with the Golgi marker Man49-mCherry. Thus, CNGC20<sub>FL</sub>-GFP may have a lower efficiency in trafficking to the vacuole than CNGC19<sub>FL</sub>-GFP under our experimental conditions, resulting in the accumulation of CNGC20<sub>FL</sub>-GFP in Golgi and possibly other undefined punctate subcellular structures. We observed a decrease in punctate labelling when CNGC20<sub>N2</sub>-GFP was co-expressed with CNGC19<sub>FL</sub>-mCherry, with 70–80 % more of the cells exhibiting some vacuolar labelling, possibly indicating an increased efficiency in CNGC20<sub>FL</sub>-GFP trafficking to the vacuolar membrane in the presence of co-expressed CNGC19<sub>FL</sub>-mCherry. Since plant CNGC polypeptides most likely assemble as tetramers to form functional cation channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C21">Hua <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>), we speculate that the simultaneous expression of CNGC19<sub>FL</sub>-mCherry and CNGC20<sub>FL</sub>-GFP causes the chimeric proteins interacting with each other to form CNGC19/CNGC20 hetero-multimers, which are transported together to the vacuole membrane.Protoplasts expressing GFP fused to the entire hydrophilic N-terminal region of CNGC19 or CNGC20 (CNGC19<sub>N2</sub>-GFP; CNGC20<sub>N2</sub>-GFP) do not display diffuse cytosolic labelling, but instead exhibit punctate labelling. This suggests that the N-terminal regions of CNGC19 and CNGC20 contain information that influences protein sorting, but are not sufficient to direct proteins to the vacuole. Interestingly, the N-terminal regions of group IV-A CNGCs contain a novel 19-aa conserved motif (LxxSGxLGxCxDPxCxxCP). Since GFP fusions harbouring shortened versions of the N-terminal region truncated just prior to this motif (CNGC19<sub>N1</sub>-GFP; CNGC20<sub>N1</sub>-GFP) exhibit diffuse labelling of the cytosol, we speculate that the 19-aa interval may play a role in protein sorting. Interestingly, in protoplast co-transfection experiments, the Golgi marker Man49-mCherry co-localized with CNGC20<sub>N2</sub>-GFP, but not with CNGC19<sub>N2</sub>-GFP. This suggests that differences exist between the protein sorting information contained within the N-terminal hydrophilic regions of CNGC19 and CNGC20. These differences may contribute, at least in part, to the dissimilar localization patterns of our full-length CNGC19<sub>FL</sub>-GFP and CNGC20<sub>FL</sub>-GFP fusions with regard to the absence or presence of punctate labelling (respectively).The presence of CNGC19 and CNGC20 at vacuolar membranes suggests that these channels serve as pathways for the passive transport of cations between the vacuole and cytosol. Since the genes encoding CNGC19 and CNGC20 are upregulated by salt stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C31">Maathuis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C31">Kugler <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C48">Yuen and Christopher 2010</xref>), one possible function of these channel proteins is to ameliorate the effects of deleterious levels of Na<sup>+</sup> in the cytosol by facilitating Na<sup>+</sup> redistribution between the cytosol and vacuole. It is unlikely, however, that CNGC19 and CNGC20 play a direct role in the sequestration of Na<sup>+</sup> to the central vacuole since Na<sup>+</sup> must be actively transported against its electrochemical gradient, a function performed by vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> (NHX) antiporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C3">Apse <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C4">2003</xref>). An alternative possibility is that CNGC19 and CNGC20 facilitate the plant's response to salinity by mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling. Salt stress induces a rapid rise in cGMP levels, and a transient increase in free cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]; at moderate salt concentrations (50 mM), suppressing cGMP accumulation with an inhibitor of guanylyl cyclases also diminishes the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C14">Donaldson <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, which are activated by cyclic nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C28">Li <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>), could function as a link between cGMP accumulation and the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C14">Donaldson <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). The potential involvement of vacuolar CNGCs in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling is circumstantially supported by experiments in tobacco protoplasts that have demonstrated that cAMP and cGMP can trigger the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the cytosol from both intracellular and extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C45">Volotovski <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>). In addition to being upregulated by salt stress, <italic>CNGC19</italic> and <italic>CNGC20</italic> have been implicated in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> response to infection by bacterial and fungal pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT012C33">Moeder <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). If CNGC19 and CNGC20 are indeed Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, they may serve a similar molecular function in the response to both abiotic and biotic stress by mediating calcium signalling through the release of vacuolar Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cytosol.CNGC19 and CNGC20 are components of vacuole membranes. Under the protoplast transient expression system, CNGC20 is weakly trafficked to the vacuole.However, co-expression of CNGC19 and CNGC20 results in efficient transport of CNGC20 to the vacuolar membrane, possibly due to the formation of heteromultimeric channels. How CNGC19 and CNGC20 influence cation fluxes within plant cells in response to salt stress and biotic stress remains unclear. Future experiments defining the permeability of these channels to various cations will clarify whether CNGC19 and CNGC20 are directly involved in the subcellular redistribution of Na<sup>+</sup> or function as mediators of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling.This research was supported by a <grant-sponsor xlink:type="simple">Hatch project award</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num xlink:type="simple">HAW00507-H</grant-num>) and the <grant-sponsor xlink:type="simple">Advances in Biosciences Education programme</grant-sponsor> funded by the <grant-sponsor xlink:type="simple">National Science Foundation</grant-sponsor> (grant no. <grant-num xlink:type="simple">MCB-09-58107</grant-num>).D.A.C. conceived the project, and D.A.C. and C.C.Y.Y. designed the protoplast transient expression experiments and developed all the new fusion constructs utilized in this study.

Immunoblot analysis was performed using the anti-CNGC20-specific peptide antiserum on 40 μg of total seedling proteins (14-day-old) from wild type (WT) and the CNGC20 T-DNA mutant (MUT). The homozygous T-DNA insert (SALK_129133.22.05) is in the fourth exon of the CNGC20 locus (At3g17700). The antiserum detects a single band of ∼84 kDa in the wild-type protein sample, which is the predicted size of CNGC20, whereas no CNGC20 protein is detected in the mutant. This indicates that the antiserum is specific to CNGC20. Coomassie-stained proteins (COOM) are shown from a duplicate gel.
