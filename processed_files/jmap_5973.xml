Short-term versus medium-term monitoring for detecting gully-erosion variability in a Mediterranean environmentThis study investigates howmediumâ€termgullyâ€development data differ from shortâ€termdata, andwhich factors influence their spatial and temporal variability at nine selected actively retreating bank gullies situated in four Spanish basin landscapes. Smallâ€format aerial photographs using unmanned, remoteâ€controlled platforms were taken at the gully sites in shortâ€term intervals of one to two years over mediumâ€term periods of seven to 13years and gully change during each period was determined using stereophotogrammetry and a geographic information system.Resultsshow a high variability of annual gully retreat rates both between gullies and between observation periods. The mean linear headcut retreat rates range between 0Â·02 and 0Â·26maâ€“1. Gully area loss was between 0Â·8 and 22mÂ² aâ€“1 and gully volume loss between 0Â·5 to 100mÂ³ aâ€“1, of which sidewall erosion may play a considerable part. A nonâ€linear relationship be- tween catchment area and mediumâ€term gully headcut volume change was found for these gullies. The shortâ€term changes observed at the individual gullies show very high variability: on average, the maximum headcut volume change observed in 7â€“13 years was 14Â·3 times larger than the minimum change. Dependency on precipitation varies but is clearly higher for headcuts than sidewalls, especially in smaller and less disturbed catchments. The varying influences of land use and human activities with their positive or negative effects on runoff production and connectivity play a dominant role in these study areas, both for shortâ€term variability and mediumâ€term difference in gully development. The study proves the value of capturing spatially continuous, highâ€resolution threeâ€dimensional data using smallâ€format aerial photography for detailed gully monitoring. Results confirm that shortâ€term data are not representative of longerâ€term gully development and demonstrate the necessity for mediumâ€ to longâ€term monitoring. However, shortâ€term data are still required to understand the processes â€“ particularly human activity at varying time scales â€“ causing fluctuations in gully erosion rates. Copyright
