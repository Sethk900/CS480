 Thank You to the Reviewers of the 2014  Auk , Volume 131   Peer review, honest and careful, is the cornerstone of modern scientific publishing, and essential to the maintenance of high standards in a journal. For the 2014 volume, the peer reviewers were asked to evaluate manuscripts with a new and important mission of our journal: the launching of  The Auk: Ornithological Advances . The efforts of reviewers are critical and yet unpaid, and so in the name of all of us at this old&ndash;new journal, I take the opportunity to thank all of you who contributed reviews while Volume 131 was in preparation (reviews completed between September 1, 2013, and July 31, 2014). Individuals with an asterisk next to their name reviewed two, three, or even four manuscripts!    The Auk: Ornithological Advances  is also grateful for the work of our two dedicated Editors, our busy Associate Editors, and the In Memoriam, Book Reviews, and 100 Years Ago Editors, and the expert editorial team members of the Central Ornithology Publication Office (COPO) whose work made the production of a brand new year, look, and content possible in 2014.
