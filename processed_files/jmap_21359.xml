Three species of Amphicorina (Annelida, Sabellida, Sabellidae) from Japan, with descriptions of two new speciesAbstract We describe two new species and redescribe one in the polychaete genus Amphicorina Clapar√®de, 1864 (Sabellidae) from Hokkaido, Japan. Amphicorina ascidicola sp. n. differs from its 38 congeners chiefly in the reduction of the collar, but also in having three pairs of radioles, one pair of ventral radiolar appendages, a bifurcate ventral lobe on the anterior peristomial ring, six abdominal chaetigers, and a large anterior tooth on the abdominal uncini. Amphicorina ezoensis sp. n. has a crenulated collar, three pairs of radioles, and more than eight (12) abdominal chaetigers; Amphicorina ezoensis shares these character states with Amphicorina anneae (Rouse, 1994), Amphicorina eimeri (Langerhans, 1880), and Amphicorina persinosa (Ben-Eliahu, 1975), but differs from them in having two pairs of ventral radiolar appendages and a non-oblique collar. Amphicorina mobilis (Rouse, 1990) was previously known only from the type locality (New South Wales, Australia), but we identify our Japanese material as conspecific on the basis of morphological and molecular similarity.
