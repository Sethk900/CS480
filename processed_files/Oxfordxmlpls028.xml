Crop tolerance to lowered availability of nutrients is a major breeding objective in rice. Current understanding of complex genetic control of N and P utilisation is being converged towards precision breeding such as marker assisted breeding for nutrient efficient varieties.  Food production has to increase to meet the demand of a growing population. In light of the high energy costs and increasingly scarce resources, future agricultural systems have to be more productive and more efficient in terms of inputs such as fertilizer and water. The development of rice varieties with high yield under low-nutrient conditions has therefore become a breeding priority. The rapid progress made in sequencing and molecular-marker technology is now beginning to change the way breeding is done, providing new opportunities.  Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are applied to agricultural systems in large quantities and a deficiency of either nutrient leads to yield losses and triggers complex molecular and physiological responses. The underlying genes are now being identified and studied in detail, and an increasing number of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to N and P uptake and utilization are being reported. Here, we provide an overview of the different aspects related to N and P in rice production systems, and apply a breeder's perspective on the potential of relevant genes and pathways for breeding applications.  For the development of nutrient-efficient rice, a holistic approach should be followed combining optimized fertilizer management with enhanced nutrient uptake via a vigorous root system, leading to increased grain filling and yield. Despite an increasing number of N- and P-related genes and QTLs being reported, very few are actively used in molecular breeding programmes. The complex regulation of N- and P-related pathways challenges breeders and the research community to identify large-effect genes/QTLs. For this it will be important to focus more on the analysis of tolerant genotypes rather than model plants, since tolerance pathways may employ a different set of genes.  Life in Asia depends on rice not only because it provides &gt;70 % of the daily calories for the population, but also because of its important role as a source of income for millions of rice farmers and landless workers ( Dawe 2000 ). Global food security is at stake since the demand for rice is exceeding production. Furthermore, the increase in rice production shows a diminishing trend, falling from 1.6 % per annum in the 1990s to &lt;1.0 % by 2010 ( Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 2003 ). Having surpassed the seven billion mark, global population growth is the lone serious factor that influences increased demand for rice ( United Nations Population Fund 2011 ). With increasing urbanization, land suitable and available for agriculture is diminishing and an increase in rice production has to be obtained by increasing productivity, i.e. an increased yield per unit land. In addition to improved and sustainable agro-management options, higher-yielding and more nutrient efficient genotypes have to be developed in order to secure rice production.  Mineral nutrition in rice requires 16 essential elements ( De Datta 1981 ), of which nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) are applied to rice fields as chemical fertilizers in large quantities. Nitrogen and P are fundamental to crop development because they form the basic component of many organic molecules, nucleic acids and proteins ( Lea and Miflin 2011 ). Estimates suggest that, from 2008 to 2012, global fertilizer demand will increase by 1.7 % annually, amounting to âˆ¼15 million tons (Mt), of which 69 % is required in Asia alone ( Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 2008 ). By 2012, global demand for N fertilizer will increase by âˆ¼1.4 % (7.3 Mt) and by âˆ¼2 % (4.2 Mt) for P fertilizer. Since Asia's share of global rice production is &gt;90 % ( Gulati and Narayanan 2002 ), a substantial proportion of the increased fertilizer demand would be utilized for rice production ( Witt  et al.  2009 ). This is of growing concern because recent estimates ( Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 2008 ) indicate a declining trend in nutrient-use efficiency as a consequence of the fertilizer consumption exceeding the grain production. In addition, fertilizer prices are increasing due to high energy costs and because natural resources are limited and increasingly difficult to assess, as will be outlined in more detail below.  The mineral fertilizers, apart from their immense benefit, when applied in excess cause eutrophication of freshwater estuaries and coastal water ecosystems ( Raven and Taylor 2003 ), and the increased emission of greenhouse gases, such as nitrous oxide (N 2 O;  Matson  et al.  1998 ). If this practice of surplus fertilization continues, nutrient leaching and atmospheric contamination will soon become widespread problems in developing countries ( Ortiz-Monasterio  et al.  2001 ). However, excess P quickly becomes adhered to soil particles owing to its insoluble nature and can lead to deficiencies of copper, iron (Fe), manganese and zinc. Moreover, erosion of P-enriched soils can contaminate water bodies and trigger eutrophication in freshwater systems ( Wolf 1996 ). Therefore, a balanced and sustainable use of fertilizers is of utmost importance. The food crisis in 2008 ( Von Braun 2008 ), which triggered socio-political unrest worldwide, has given us a first glimpse of what is to come if we do not succeed in providing sufficient food at affordable costs, long term and in a sustainable way.  In spite of being the most abundant element in the atmosphere (78 %), N is one of the most limiting nutrients in natural and agricultural ecosystems. It enters the soil only in miniscule amounts through natural precipitation and biological N fixation. Although significant N reserves are present in the soil (2â€“20 t ha âˆ’1 ) ( Bockman  et al.  1990 ), only a limited amount is available to plants. Since plants require large quantities of N, greater than those of any other primary nutrient, plant assimilation of soil N often exceeds the amount being replenished ( Epstein and Bloom 2005 ). Native sources of soil N include pre-existing inorganic and organic forms, net N mineralization from organic matter, biological N fixation, and N inputs from irrigation waters and deposition from the atmosphere ( Cassman  et al.  1996 ). The majority of plant-useable N is consumed as nitrate (NO 3 ) from well-aerated soils and as ammonium (NH 4  + ) from poorly aerated, submerged soils ( Huang  et al.  2000 ). Although NH 4  +  uptake requires less energy than that of NO 3 , only a few plant species, such as rice, are capable of growing exclusively with NH 4  +  ( Kronzucker  et al.  1999 ). Since rice is capable of assimilating both forms of N ( Wang  et al.  1993 a  ;  Kronzucker  et al.  1998 ) it is adapted to aerobic as well as anaerobic growth conditions.  In traditional rice ecosystems, low-N stress is a problem in marginal areas where no or sub-optimal levels of N are applied ( Laffite and Edmeades 1994 a  ,   b  ;  Agrama  et al.  1999 ) because farmers lack resources to purchase fertilizers and agricultural practices are often subsistence farming ( Ortiz-Monasterio  et al.  2001 ). Furthermore, diminishing non-renewable global energy resources, such as petroleum and natural gas, demand more efficient fertilizer utilization for two compelling reasons: (i) conservation of energy, because the chemical synthesis of N fertilizers requires ammonia produced by the Haberâ€“Bosch process ( Travis 1993 ), for which natural methane is the major hydrogen source; and (ii) curtailing the everâ€“increasing fertilizer costs. Although N deficiency, in particular, can be managed to a certain extent by addition of organic manures and by cultivation of fallow legumes ( Balasubramanian  et al.  2004 ), a significant reduction in N-fertilizer application can be achieved by optimizing the rate and timing of fertilizer application to synchronize N supply and demand ( Peng and Bouman 2007 ;  Chen  et al.  2011 ). To further reduce N applications, an alternative approach is the development of varieties that use N more efficiently, either physiologically, that is, increased carbon gain per unit plant N and time, or agronomically, i.e. greater dry matter production and protein yield per unit N ( Laungani and Knops 2009 ). However, the major obstacle in achieving this is the low N-use efficiency of &lt;40 %, which requires improvement in N foraging and uptake.  Crop varieties can respond to nutrient supply in four different ways, namely by being efficient or inefficient under nutrient deficiency, and as a responder or non-responder under nutrient sufficiency ( Ortiz-Monasterio  et al.  2001 ). Efficient genotypes are those that possess high external (uptake) efficiency, whereas responders are characterized by high internal (utilization) efficiency. Since nutrient uptake and utilization are interdependent, it is difficult to distinguish a responder from an efficient cultivar. It is therefore important to develop efficient selection criteria for low-nutrient tolerance, to differentiate between external and internal efficiency ( Agrama 2006 ), and to assess genetic variability ( Broadbent  et al.  1987 ;  DeDatta and Broadbent 1988 ). This necessitates a careful integration of both physiological and agronomic evaluation of cultivars under low- and high-nutrient regimes. For high-input systems, remarkable breeding efforts have already been carried out for the selection of responder varieties with high internal efficiency. This now has to be complemented with breeding of cultivars that are tolerant of nutrient deficiency and cultivars that maintain a high yield with reduced fertilizer inputs.  Selection in environments with low nutrient status is often plagued by problems of low heritability and high environmental variability. Although nutrient-scarce environments are not normally preferred by breeders, selection under such conditions will be more effective for yield  per se  rather than selection for yield potential alone ( Muruli and Paulsen 1981 ;  Blum 1988 ). Evaluation under field conditions is preferable over screenings in nutrient solution since the latter cannot simulate the complex soilâ€“plant interaction. Furthermore, in the case of N, screening of genotypes at low N levels would additionally avoid problems of vulnerability to pests and diseases and lodging, which creates artefacts at high N levels ( Tirol-Padre  et al.  1996 ).  To establish selection criteria for higher uptake efficiency, it is essential to study yield components, biomass production, as well as nutrient assimilation in relation to the traits determining uptake efficiency such as a large root volume, efficient nutrient absorption and nutrient transport ( Bassirirad 2000 ;  Wang  et al.  2006 ). This is particularly important because high nutrient-uptake efficiency without repletion of nutrients might accelerate nutrient depletion, while low-nutrient-efficient genotypes may lead to increased nutrient leaching or volatilization under high-nutrient situations ( Ortiz-Monasterio  et al.  2001 ). In addition, a clear understanding of environmental parameters, such as location effect, weather and radiation, and their effect on nutrient uptake in different genotypes, can leverage an objective-based distinction between uptake vs. utilization efficiency in the target environment. In practice, however, it is difficult to formulate a strict screening strategy for N use, because of the poor understanding of the underlying routes leading to better use efficiency. More often than not, genotype evaluations for N-use efficiency are conducted under two regimens: N-fertilized and native (no N fertilizer added) conditions. This may lead to identification of tolerant genotypes to zero fertilized conditions possessing traits related to low-N tolerance. Many researchers, however, argue that such varieties may be unsuitable for fertilized conditions because, in practice, no crop is going to be grown under unfertilized conditions. Therefore, they suggest a system-level approach if the target is N-use efficiency under fertilized conditions. For instance, a simulation study carried out in wheat that used parameters related to plant development, the size of N storage pools in the plant and traits related to root uptake efficiency for water from two contrasting environments showed that weather, N management, leaf N content and the phyllochron are the major determinants of N-use efficiency in wheat (Semenov  et al.  2007). However, these factors may not hold good for rice, as it is adapted to flooded conditions. In general, modelling can be a useful tool to help identify the contributions of major factors influencing N-use efficiency, namely the environment, management and genotype.  In contrast to N, P is a non-renewable natural resource and there is growing concern that the natural reserves of rock phosphate, the source of P fertilizer, are limited ( Cordell  et al.  2009 ). A recent study conducted by the International Fertilizer Development Centre concluded that currently known and easily accessible world rock phosphate reserves will last for approximately another 300â€“400 years ( van Kauwenbergh 2010 ). Investments are therefore being made to discover new rock phosphate reserves and to develop alternative technologies to isolate P from e.g. marine sediments and faeces (see below). Another concern is the unequal geographical distribution of P reserves, with the vast majority of phosphate rock located in Morocco, followed by the USA and China ( van Kauwenbergh 2010 ). The dependence of the world's food production on a few countries is problematic and policies should be put in place in time to ensure equal access to P reserves in the future. In fact, China is already imposing seasonal export taxes to secure the national supply of P fertilizer (  http://agfax.com/2011/11/18/chinese-government-imposes-seasonal-export-taxes  ).  Whereas P fertilizer is applied in excess in the Western world and some Asian countries (e.g. China, Japan and Korea;  MacDonald  et al.  2011 ), P deficiency is a major problem in many Asian and African countries, as well as in South America. Estimates suggest that âˆ¼50 % of agricultural soils are deficient in P ( Lynch 2011 ). The two main reasons for this are (i) insufficient application of P in the form of P fertilizer or manure and (ii) P-fixing soil properties which render P unavailable to plants even if it is present in sometimes large amounts. Phosphorus imbalances in the world, with too much P in some countries and too little or inaccessible P in others ( MacDonald  et al.  2011 ), will require different measures and breeding strategies.  In modern agriculture, inorganic P fertilizer has widely replaced the application of manure. A large quantity of PÂ present in animal and human faeces is therefore removed from the nutrient cycle and ends up in waterways, where it is no longer available and difficult to recycle ( Cordell  et al.  2009 ). In realization of this, technologies are being developed in Europe to extract P from sewage in urban centres to produce Struvite (ammonium magnesium phosphate) that can be used as P and N fertilizer (  http://www.ceep-phosphates.org/Files/Newsletter/scope50.pdf  ). In light of decreasing rock phosphate reserves, these efforts are extremely important and, once applied on a large scale, this technology will become more competitive in terms of production costs.  The high concentration of P in human and animal faeces is due to the consumption of phytic acid (PA, inositol hexaphosphate), which is the major (50â€“80 %) storage form of P and is present in large quantities in cereal grains, legumes, soybean and other plants (for a review see  Lott  et al.  2000 ). Phytic acid is not digestible by humans and animals, and additionally it binds iron, zinc and other minerals, thereby reducing their bioavailability. Therefore, research is in progress that is aimed at reducing PA in crops (for a review see  Raboy 2009 ). Apart from its role as an â€˜anti-nutritional factorâ€™, PA is the main source of P drainage from fields. Estimates suggest that 50â€“80 % of the P in cereal grains and legume seeds is stored as PA ( Lott  et al.  2009 ). Studies on low PA ( lpa ) mutants in rice ( Larson  et al.  2000 ;  Liu  et al.  2007 ) and barley ( Bregitzer and Raboy 2006 ), however, showed that total grain P was generally higher in  lpa  mutants compared with wild-type controls, and this approach is therefore not directly applicable to reduce the P drainage from fields.  For soils naturally low in or depleted of P due to continuous cropping without repletion of P (and other nutrients), fertilizer or manure application is inevitable to maintain productivity and prevent soil degradation. However, continuous cropping of poor soil is often related to poverty, and breeding of efficient crops, therefore, has to be complemented by policy measures providing poor farmers with agricultural inputs. With regard to breeding for poor soils, crops with high P uptake and high internal P-use efficiency need to be developed to maximize yield in such low-input systems ( Rose and Wissuwa 2012 ). In addition, a combination of both, uptake and internal-nutrient efficiency, is equally desirable for high-input systems since it would facilitate reduction of fertilizer doses without yield penalty. In rice, P fertilizer-use efficiency is only âˆ¼25 % ( Dobermann and Fairhurst 2000 ), providing considerable scope for improvement.  For areas with P-fixing soils, high fertilizer application is currently necessary in order to provide sufficient plant-available P. Soils with P-fixing properties are widespread in the Asia Pacific and occur on 5 % of the total land area ( Bot  et al.  2000 ). In China, Indonesia, Japan, Thailand and Vietnam, P-fixing soils cover 9â€“15 % of the total land area. These numbers are even higher in Laos (24 %) and Myanmar (16 %). In Africa, P-fixing soils are especially widespread in Burundi, Congo, Liberia, Swaziland and Rwanda (16â€“29 %). Similar numbers are reported from South America, where P fixation occurs on 14â€“25 % of the total land area in e.g. Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru and Ecuador. In French Guyana, 79 % of the total land area has P-fixing properties ( Bot  et al.  2000 ). The development of crops that can access P reserves in these soils and that are highly efficient in P fertilizer uptake should therefore be a global breeding priority. In addition, it is critically important to develop crops with tolerance of multiple stresses because P deficiency is often a secondary effect in soils with high concentrations of iron and aluminium, and with low pH, which restrict root growth even if P is available ( Ismail  et al.  2007 ).   Plant system attributes relevant for improved N and P efficiency.  Improved nutrient management comes with balancing of factors that affect uptake and utilization efficiencies in plants. Genotypes that are plastic to external nutrient availability can survive and yield better under low nutrient stress.  The uptake process and N homeostasis are complex processes that involve recycling of N (especially amino acids) from shoots to roots via the phloem, and from roots to shoots via the xylem ( Imsande and Touraine 1994 ;  Marschner  et al.  1997 ). In rice plants, particularly during the vegetative stage, roots play a significant role in N absorption with root density and distribution in the soil being the major determinants ( Youngdahl  et al.  1982 ). Although there are many studies related to variation in N uptake in rice, there seems to be little information on differences in root morphology that may contribute to this variation. Root characteristics such as root length density and root weight density have been identified as important factors because N uptake is determined by root mass and N uptake per unit root volume ( Shimono and Bunce 2009 ). A recent study on two rice cultivars by  Fan  et al.  (2010)  further indicates a significant influence of root morphological parameters and physiological characteristics on N-use efficiency at different growth stages.  The molecular responses to N are complex in rice, as shown by rapid induction/repression of many stress responsible genes and transcription factors coupled with repression of photosynthetic and energy metabolism genes in seedlings subjected to low N stress ( Lian et al. 2006 ). However, intricate aspects of N utilization are well studied in model plants such as  Arabidopsis . Many gene families, including NO 3  and NH 4  +  transporters and primary assimilation genes, amino acid transporters, as well as transcription factors and other regulatory genes, have been identified by different approaches. With the identification of orthologous genes from rice, opportunities are now emerging for utilizing these genes in marker-assisted breeding for N efficiency (for reviews, see  Li  et al.  2009 b  ;  Kant  et al.  2011 ). Nitrogen uptake in roots is mainly regulated by a high-affinity transport system that regulates uptake at N levels &lt;1 mM, and a low-affinity transport system that functions at higher N concentrations ( Forde and Clarkson 1999 ;  Glass  et al.  2001 ;  Williams and Miller 2001 ). It has been shown that the low-affinity NO 3  transporter  OsNRT1  contributes predominantly to N uptake in the root epidermis and root hairs ( Lin  et al.  2000 ), acting in conjunction with the high-affinity and NO 3 -inducible transporters NRT2 and NAR2 ( Cai  et al.  2008 ). Recent data provided further insight into the complexity of N uptake, showing that the mRNA of  OsNRT2.3  is alternatively spliced ( OsNRT2.3a/b ) during the uptake process, and that  OsNAR2.1  interacts with two other NRT proteins ( Yan  et al.  2011 ). Furthermore, it was shown that most transporter genes are up-regulated by NO 3  and suppressed by NH 4  + , with the exception of  OsNRT2.3b , which is insensitive to NH 4  +  ( Feng  et al.  2011 ). Similarly to  Arabidopsis , high-affinity rice NH 4  +  transporters are encoded by members of the AMT1 and AMT2 gene families ( Gazzarini  et al.  1999 ;  Howitt and Udvardi 2000 ;  LoquÃ© and von WirÃ©n 2004 ). Although functionally not well characterized, 12 putative rice AMT proteins have been identified located on different chromosomes and grouped into five sub-families (AMT1â€“AMT5) with one to three gene members ( Suenaga  et al.  2003 ;  Deng  et al.  2007 ;  Li  et al.  2009 b  ). Gene expression analyses showed that  OsAMT1;1  is constitutively expressed in shoots and roots ( Ding  et al.  2011 ). In contrast,  OsAMT1;2  shows root-specific expression and is NH 4  +  inducible, whereas  OsAMT1;3  is root specific and N suppressible ( Sonoda  et al.  2003 ). In addition, a high-affinity urea transporter ( OsDUR3 ) encoding an integral membrane protein that is up-regulated under N deficiency has recently been identified in rice roots ( Wang  et al.  2012 ).  OsDUR3  over-expression improved growth on low urea and this gene might therefore play a significant role in N uptake in rice. Urea is converted to NH 4  +  and carbon dioxide in the presence of urease, which requires nickel (Ni) as a co-factor. Interestingly, the application of Ni had a marked effect on plant growth in rice when urea was provided as the sole N source ( Gerendas  et al.  1998 ). Furthermore, an early nodulin gene ( OsENOD93-1 ) with potential function in amino acid accumulation and transport has been identified in rice ( Bi  et al.  2009 ).  To enable plants to accumulate sufficient internal N, it is critically important to apply N fertilizer at appropriate developmental stages. In irrigated rice fields, N fertilizer is usually applied in three splits, i.e. at transplanting (basal), at maximum tillering and at panicle initiation. This practice is recommended to rice farmers ( Williams  et al.  2010 ) and is now widely adopted. Urea is the major source of N in rice ecosystems since it is rapidly converted to NH 4  +  or NO 3  by soil micro-organisms. In cereals, depending on the genotype and environmental conditions, the root or shoot can be the main site for NO 3  assimilation, with root assimilation dominating at soil nitrate concentrations &lt;1 mM and shoot assimilation at concentrations &gt;1 mM ( Andrews 1986 ;  Andrews  et al.  1995 ). Upon absorption, NO 3  is reduced to nitrite by nitrate reductase (NR) and subsequently to NH 4  +  by nitrite reductase (NiR). NH 4  +  from both the nitrate reduction pathway and direct absorption are subsequently incorporated into amino acids through the synthesis of glutamine and glutamate ( Crawford and Glass 1998 ;  Meyer and Stitt 2001 ;  Campbell 2002 ) primarily in the chloroplasts and plastids via the glutamine synthetase (GS)/glutamate synthase (GOGAT) cycle ( Tobin and Yamaya 2001 ;  Andrews  et al.  2004 ) and alternatively via pathways involving glutamate dehydrogenase and asparagine synthetase ( Hirel and Lea 2002 ;  Dubois  et al.  2003 ). Although roots have high constitutive levels of GS and GOGAT, both enzymes are inducible by NH 4  +  ( Ishiyama  et al.  2003 ). For the conversion of glutamine to glutamate by GOGAT, either ferredoxin (Fd-GOGAT) or NADH (NADH-GOGAT) is used. For GS, two major forms are known, namely cytosolic GS (GS1), expressed in roots and shoots, and plastidic GS (GS2), expressed in chloroplasts and plastids. GS1 is a complex gene family of three to six genes ( Hirel and Lea 2002 ).  Remobilization of internal N during grain filling is another key process in N metabolism. Among the primary N assimilation genes (for a review see  Lea and Miflin 2011 ), physiological and biochemical evidence indicates that GS1 plays a major role in the synthesis of glutamine in older leaves, which is then transported to panicles ( Kamachi  et al.  1991 ;  Habash  et al.  2001 ;  Masclaux  et al.  2001 ), a process positively related to yield and N-use efficiency. The GS1 genes from rice,  OsGS1;1 OsGS1;2 , are expressed in all organs, but with higher expression in leaf blades and roots, respectively.  OsGS1;3  is found specifically in the spikelet ( Tabuchi  et al.  2005 ). Prior to senescence, GS1 activity is reduced, which leads to rapid accumulation of NH 4  +  and senescence since accumulated NH 4  +  is highly toxic to plant cells ( Chen and Kao 1996 ). In addition, it was shown that a knock-out mutation in  OsGS1.1  resulted in reduced plant growth and poor yield ( Tabuchi  et al.  2005 ), whereas over-expression of the GS2 gene increased yield in wheat and  Arabidopsis  ( Habash  et al.  2001 ;  Martin  et al.  2006 ), and enhanced photo-respiratory capacity and salt tolerance in rice ( Hoshida  et al.  2000 ). Re-assimilation and conversion of glutamine to glutamate by GOGAT is tissue specific with Fd-GOGAT predominantly active in photosynthetic tissues ( Lea 1997 ) and NADH-GOGAT in the developing sink organs where it plays a significant role in re-utilization of glutamine ( Hayakawa et al. 1993 ;  Tabuchi  et al.  2007 ). Over-expression of NADH-GOGAT increased the panicle weight in rice, in agreement with its important role in transporting glutamate to major sink tissues during grain filling ( Yamaya  et al.  1992 ). This enzyme may therefore play a key role in N utilization and grain filling in rice ( Andrews  et al.  2004 ). The rice  OsNADH-GOGAT1  gene is mainly expressed in growing tissues such as root tips, young spikelets and developing leaf blades, and is important for N remobilization, whereas the second rice gene,  OsNADH-GOGAT2 , is mainly expressed in mature leaves and leaf sheaths ( Tabuchi  et al.  2007 ). A recent study on non-functional  OsNADH-GOGAT2  mutants has shown a significant decrease in spikelet number per panicle associated with a reduction in yield and plant biomass, as well as total N content in senescing leaves. This implies that NADH-GOGAT2 is also important for remobilization of N and glutamine generation in senescing leaves ( Tamura  et al.  2011 ).  Grain development in rice depends on the establishment and maintenance of a photosynthetically active canopy, which acts as a major N store before internal N is translocated to the panicle. Since this process occurs at the expense of the photosynthetic machinery, canopy longevity and maintenance of the photosynthetic capacity are vital for continuous remobilization of N and starch accumulation ( Hawkesford and Howarth 2011 ). In this context, the functional stay-green (FSG) trait is of interest since it delays leaf senescence and sustains photosynthesis during grain filling, which may lead to increased biomass production and grain yield ( Fu and Lee 2008 ). A detailed review on the mechanisms and potential productivity benefits of FSG has recently been published ( HÃ¶rtensteiner 2009 ). Several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for FSG have been mapped and analysed in rice introgression lines ( Yoo  et al.  2007 ;  Fu  et al.  2011 ). Although a beneficial effect of FSG on grain yield has been observed only in one of the two analysed genetic backgrounds ( Fu  et al.  2011 ), FSG holds promise for rice yield improvement and possibly for terminal drought tolerance, and should therefore be studied in detail.  In irrigated rice systems, P fertilizer is generally applied only at the beginning of the season (basal), whereas N is applied in three splits (basal/after transplanting, maximum tillering and panicle initiation/booting). This is common practice in Asia and Africa ( Haefele and Wopereis 2005 ;  Hossain  et al.  2005 ), indicating that P acquisition and requirement are highest during the early growth stages. Under P-deficient conditions, plant development is delayed and P deficiency symptoms (reduced tillering and darker leaves due to anthocyanin accumulation) are easily recognized and cause significant yield losses ( Dobermann and Fairhurst 2000 ). Another important factor is that P, in contrast to N and K, is not transported with the soil solution (mass flow) but mainly by diffusion ( Schachtman  et al.  1998 ). A large root surface area is therefore particularly important for P uptake since plants gain access to a larger soil area and thereby to P ( Lynch 2007 ). In agreement with that, induction of root growth under P deficiency has been described in many species ( HernÃ¡ndez  et al.  2007 ), although it should be noted that root growth under â€“P conditions is generally reduced compared with that of plants grown under +P conditions ( Li  et al.  2009 a  ;  Chin  et al.  2010 ). For yield stability under P deficient conditions, long root hairs and highly branched root systems, especially in the top soil where P is mainly located, are considered beneficial ( Ramaekers  et al.  2010 ). In agreement with this, the  Phosphorus uptake 1  ( Pup1 ) major QTL for tolerance of P deficiency is an enhancer of root growth ( Gamuyao  et al.  2012 ). The same was observed in the P-deficiency-tolerant maize mutant line 99038 ( Li  et al.  2008 ), which likewise developed a larger root system.  Phosphorus is transported into the plant by P transporters located in the root plasma membrane. In the rice reference genome, 13 P transporter genes are present ( Paszkowski  et al.  2002 ). Two of these transporters have been functionally characterized, revealing that  OsPT2  encodes a low-affinity and  OsPT6  a high-affinity transporter ( Ai  et al.  2009 ). High-affinity transporters are generally induced under low-P conditions ( Paszkowski  et al.  2002 ) and are therefore considered more important for P uptake under field conditions since the soil P concentration is âˆ¼1000 times lower compared with intracellular concentrations ( Schachtman  et al.  1998 ). In agreement with this,  OsPT6 , but not  OsPT2 , was shown to be expressed in the root epidermis ( Ai  et al.  2009 ). In another study ( Jia  et al.  2011 ), the effect of the rice P transporter  OsPht1;8  was analysed by over-expression and RNAi. The authors showed that P uptake in the transgenics was altered according to expectation; however, both approaches led to a significant reduction in the number and size of panicles, as well as to &gt;80 % spikelet sterility. In another study on rice, transgenic plants over-expressing the tobacco transporter  NtPT1  were generated, but although some lines outperformed the controls, on average transgenic lines yielded less ( Park  et al.  2010 ). Likewise, it was shown in barley that over-expression of the transporter gene  HORvu;Pht1;1  did not increase P uptake ( Rae  et al.  2004 ). Taken together, the data suggest that over-expression of high-affinity transporters alone is not sufficient to improve P efficiency. This might be due to the fact that the high-affinity P-transport system is naturally induced to a high level, sufficient to transport the P available at the rootâ€“soil interphase ( Rae  et al.  2004 ;  Pariasca-Tanaka  et al.  2009 ). Rather than P uptake, the limiting factor might therefore be the depletion of P in the vicinity of the roots. This can be addressed by developing plants with a larger root system/surface area that provides access to a larger soil area. In fact, this has been shown to be the underlying mechanism of the  Pup1  major QTL ( Gamuyao  et al.  2012 ). Alternatively, or in addition, enhanced mobilization of P from complexes and organic compounds via exudation of organic acids, acid phosphatases and phytases (for a review see  Gahoonia and Nielsen 2004 ) would increase the P supply to roots. In winter barley ( Hordeum vulgare  L.), it has already been shown that a cultivar with high exudation of citric and acetic acid mobilized more P from the strongly absorbed soil P fraction, and plants developed a higher shoot dry matter than the cultivar with low exudation ( Gahoonia  et al.  2000 ). Also, in barley, it was furthermore shown that expression of the wheat aluminium resistance gene  TaALMT1  enhanced P uptake on acidic soils due to an increased efflux of malate ( Delhaize  et al.  2009 ). In wheat ( Triticum aestivum  L.) oxalate, but not citrate, significantly enhanced P uptake under the experimental conditions applied in a study by  Khademi  et al.  (2010) . However, over-expression of the mitochondrial citrate synthase enhanced P uptake and growth in  Arabidopsis  ( Koyama  et al.  2000 ). Furthermore, it was shown that over-expression of the  Arabidopsis  purple acid phosphatase gene  AtPAP15  improved P efficiency and yield in soybean grown on acidic soil ( Wang  et al.  2009 ). These examples are very encouraging and in particular the finding that genetic diversity exists, at least in barley, warrants a systematic assessment of this trait in rice.  For an extended root system and thereby better access to P, mycorrhizae are generally considered important. The positive effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis on nutrient uptake, especially P and N, has been demonstrated in several crops (for a review see  Karandashov and Bucher 2005 ;  Sawers  et al.  2008 ). In rice, surprisingly very few studies on the effect of AM are available, possibly because research focuses on irrigated rice grown under flooded, anaerobic conditions, which are generally considered unfavourable for fungi. However, using the irrigated rice variety Nipponbare, it was shown that the P transporter  OsPT11  is specifically induced in roots colonized by AM ( Paszkowski  et al.  2002 ). A study from Japan additionally showed that AM inoculation of Nipponbare seedlings significantly increased yield in flooded fields and that the fungi survived under these conditions ( Solaiman and Hirata 1997 ). The latter was also found in a study by  Hajiboland  et al.  (2009)  which additionally reported a significant growth advantage of plants colonized by mycorrhiza. Surprisingly, this was observed only under flooded conditions, whereas growth was severely inhibited under aerobic conditions. Growth depression due to mycorrhiza colonization has also been reported from wheat, especially under P-deficient conditions ( Li  et al.  2005 ). However, another study on rice that analysed the effect of mycorrhiza in four different upland crop-rotation systems showed a significant increase in P uptake and grain yield in the system with the highest concentration of mycorrhiza ( Maiti  et al.  2012 ). More systematic and detailed studies are needed to conclusively assess the potential of mycorrhiza for enhancement of P uptake in irrigated and rain-fed rice systems, and to address genetic diversity for mycorrhizal interaction (Fig.Â  1 ).  In contrast to enhanced P uptake, improvement of internal P-use efficiency would target genes/pathways that enable plants to maintain cellular processes and productivity under low-P conditions. Since P is an indispensable component of virtually all cellular functions and is required in large amounts, e.g. ATP, NADPH, nucleic acids and phosphoproteins, it is reasonable to expect that modification of P-related pathways will affect the whole plant. Alternative pathways have been described that are up-regulated under P starvation utilizing PPi rather than ATP (for a review see  Hammond  et al.  2004 ). This includes UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (PPi-dependent conversion of glucose to hexose-P) and phosphofructokinase (PPi-dependent phosphorylation of fructose-6-P). Other adaptive processes include the substitution of phospholipids with galacto- and sulfolipids, and up-regulation of ribonucleases to mobilize P from nucleic acids. Many other genes and pathways are altered under low-P conditions, which is not surprising in light of the central role of P in living cells. The challenge will be to identify genes that enhance internal P-use efficiency without causing an imbalance in P homeostasis and negatively affecting plant development.  In microarray gene expression studies in rice ( Wasaki  et al.  2003 ;  Pariasca-Tanaka  et al.  2009 ) and  Arabidopsis  ( Wu  et al.  2003 ;  Morcuende  et al.  2007 ), between 220 and 5800 genes, depending on the study, were shown to respond to P. For breeding applications, it will be critically important to identify the early sensors of P deficiency and genes that act as upstream regulators of this systemic response in order to reduce complexity and the number of genes/QTLs needed to modify P-use efficiency. The regulatory network of P homeostasis has been well studied in  Arabidopsis  and, for some genes, rice orthologues have been identified. The MYB-type transcription factor  AtPHR1  ( Rubio  et al.  2001 ) and its rice orthologue  OsPHR2  ( Zhou  et al.  2008 ) act as positive regulators of P transporters and other P-responsive genes, whereas other genes act as suppressors of P starvation genes, e.g. the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme  AtPHO2  and its rice orthologue  OsLTN1  ( Aung  et al.  2006 ;  Bari  et al.  2006 ;  Hu  et al.  2011 ). Expression of  PHO2  is negatively regulated by a micro RNA (miR399), which itself is sequestered by â€˜target mimicryâ€™ of the  IPS1  gene ( Aung  et al.  2006 ;  Bari  et al.  2006 ;  Franco-Zorrilla  et al.  2007 ). Two recent reviews provide an excellent and comprehensive overview of the genes involved and their interaction ( Nilsson  et al.  2010 ;  Hammond and White 2011 ).  Interestingly, it has recently been shown in  Arabidopsis  that down-regulation of the  PHO1  gene (an SPX protein) conferred tolerance via suppression of the P starvation response ( Rouached  et al.  2011 ). A similar observation has been made in tolerant  Pup1  rice plants, which did not differentially express P starvation genes in comparison with non- Pup1  controls ( Pariasca-Tanaka  et al.  2009 ;  Gamuyao  et al.  2012 ). In this context, it is important to note that most studies on P-starvation responses in rice were conducted in the intolerant variety Nipponbare. The identified P-starvation genes and pathways, therefore, represent the intolerant response. In agreement with this, genes not formerly related to P-starvation tolerance have been identified in the  Pup1  donor variety Kasalath ( Gamuyao  et al.  2012 ) as well as in a QTL-mapping study using a tolerant  Arabidopsis  accession ( Reymond  et al.  2006 ). It therefore seems important to further explore genetic diversity, in  Arabidopsis  as well as in rice, and to identify additional tolerant genotypes in order to gain access to large-effect genes and QTLs.  Molecular breeding now provides a real opportunity to develop varieties with multiple tolerance traitsâ€”provided that large-effect QTLs/genes are available. The number of reported QTLs is steadily increasing, but still very few are applied in breeding programmes. This is largely due to a lack of data that validate QTLs/tolerance genes in different genetic backgrounds and environments (i.e. in field trials), which is a prerequisite for a large-scale application of QTLs.   Quantitative trait loci for P-related traits in rice.  The number of mapped QTLs for P-related traits in rice remains small, although one QTL,  Pup1 , is widely acclaimed for imparting P-deficiency tolerance and is currently the only P-related QTL for which molecular markers are available and which has been evaluated in different genetic backgrounds under field conditions  DW, plant dry weight; MRL, maximum root length; PH, plant height; PUE, phosphorus-use efficiency; PUP, phosphorus uptake; RDW, root dry weight; RE, root elongation; REP, root elongation under phosphorus deficiency; RFW, root fresh weight; RIC, relative Fe content; RN, root number; RPC, relative phosphorus content; RRDW, relative root dry weight; RRL, relative root length; RS, root/shoot dry weight ratio; RSDW, relative shoot dry weight: RTA, relative tillering ability; RV, root volume; SDW, shoot dry weight; TDW, total dry weight; TN, tiller number.   Quantitative trait loci for N-related traits in rice.  Almost all the N-related QTLs mapped in rice so far have smaller effects and many of them exhibit significant epistatic and QE interactions, making them less amenable to breeding programmes.  BIL, backcross inbred lines; BM, biomass; CC, chlorophyll content; CSSL, chromosomal segment substitution lines; DHL, doubled haploid lines; EQTL, epistatic QTL; GNP, grain number per panicle; GOGAT, glutamate synthase; GYP, grain yield per plant; GS, glutamine synthetase; HI, harvest index; MQTL, main-effect QTL; NDMPE, nitrogen dry matter production efficiency; NGPE, nitrogen grain production efficiency; NHI, nitrogen harvest index; NIL, near isogenic lines; NR, nitrate reductase; NTE, nitrogen translocation efficiency; NUE, nitrogen-use efficiency; NUP, nitrogen uptake; PH, plant height; PN, panicle number per plant, PW, panicle weight; PNUE, physiological nitrogen-use efficiency; RDW, root dry weight; RIL, recombinant inbred lines; RL, root length; RT, root thickness; RM, root biomass; SDW, shoot dry weight; SLN, specific leaf nitrogen; SPC, soluble protein content; TGN, total grain nitrogen; TLN, total leaf nitrogen; TSN, total shoot nitrogen; TPN, total plant nitrogen.   Future approaches in breeding nutrient-efficient varieties essentially require integration of classical and modern tools.  The low heritability of nutrient-use traits necessitates precise approaches such as trait-targeted selection augmented by modern molecular tools.  With the experiences gained in QTL mapping and the rapid development of genome-sequencing and molecular-marker technologies, more high-impact, large-effect QTLs will surely be identified in the future. These efforts require expertise in different disciplines and, therefore, modern breeding is being implemented more and more in multi-disciplinary teams involving breeders, physiologists and molecular biologists/geneticists. With the advances in molecular breeding technologies, breeders now gain access to genes from wild rice and unadapted genotypes (landraces) that are difficult to use in breeding programmes due to crossing barriers and their poor agronomic performance. Molecular breeding therefore provides an exciting opportunity to use this gene pool effectively for the development of well-adapted and nutrient-efficient rice varieties.  Both authors have contributed equally to the preparation of the manuscript with K.K.V. mainly responsible for the parts on nitrogen and S.H. for the parts on phosphorus.  None declared.
