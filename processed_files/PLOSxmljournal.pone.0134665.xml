However, till recently it remained a methodological challenge to precisely determine such invasive hotspots. We identified the hotspots of alien species invasion in India through Ecological Niche Modelling (ENM) using species occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). The predicted area of invasion for selected species were classified into 4 categories based on number of model agreements for a region i.e. high, medium, low and very low. About 49% of the total geographical area of India was predicted to be prone to invasion at moderate to high levels of climatic suitability. The intersection of anthropogenic biomes and ecoregions with the regions of 'high' climatic suitability was classified as hotspot of alien plant invasion. Nineteen of 47 ecoregions of India, harboured such hotspots. Most ecologically sensitive regions of India, including the 'biodiversity hotspots' and coastal regions coincide with invasion hotspots, indicating their vulnerability to alien plant invasion. Besides demonstrating the usefulness of ENM and open source data for IAS management, the present study provides a knowledge base for guiding the formulation of an effective policy and management strategy for controlling the invasive alien species.In the figure, the boxes represent 25–75 percent quartiles of the AUC values, and the horizontal line inside the boxes represents the median. The minimal and maximal values are shown with whiskers drawn from the top of the box up to the largest data point less than 1.5 times the box height from the box, and similarly below the box. The circles represent the outlier values, and the stars represent the extreme values.Grading of model quality was done based on AUC value as: Poor (&lt;0.8), Fair (0.8–0.9), Good (0.9–0.95) and Very good (0.95–1.0).A-E show the model consensus identified by summing up the thresholded model projections for multiple species from—(A) Africa, (B) Australia, (C) Europe, (D) North America, and (E) South America. The figure legend show the model agreements, wherein ‘high’ represents the areas with highest model agreement, and ‘very low’ having the lowest agreements. Higher model agreements represent larger number of alien invasive species while the lower model agreements represent lower number of alien invasives.The bar diagram depicts the percentage of total geographical area under various consensus class in different states of India. The climate suitability map was generated by combining 525 thresholded model projections from Africa, Australia, Europe, North America and South America. The legend show the model agreements, wherein 'high' represents the areas with highest range of model agreements, and 'very low' having the lowest range of model agreements. 'High' agreement represent high species richness, while 'low' agreement represent low species richness.The delineated areas cover &gt;50 percent area of various ecoregions, are climatically suitable for a large number of invasive alien species, and have signature of diverse anthropogenic activities. The boundary files on biodiversity hotspots were overlaid on the modelled invasion hotspots matches to portray the level of threat to these areas from invasive alien species.Invasion hotspots coincide with hotspots of biodiversity: This can be viewed from a threat perspective as it would endanger the persistence of many resident and endemic species. Enumeration of IAS should be undertaken in the biodiversity rich biomes and their impact on other native species at ecosystem level needs to be analysed.Invasion hotspots coincide with islands, coastal areas and protected forest areas: Surveillance and quarantine measures should be stepped up in such areas as they may act as important sites of introduction, colonization and establishment of IAS.Invasion hotspots coincide with croplands, rangelands and village biomes: Efforts for eradication and control of the alien invasives in these areas should be given top priority as it is relatively easier to control them at the beginning of their spread.The remote forest biomes are unlikely to be invasion hotspots: The remote forest biomes did not coincide with any invasion hotspot. These biomes in India include areas with high tree cover and low human population. Therefore, it is important that such biomes are maintained in its present condition with minimum anthropogenic interferences.While recommending the above, we do recognize the following limitations of our predictions on hotspot of alien species: (i) although a biome may not support multiple IAS, yet a particular invasive species can pose serious threat to the biome, and (ii) the predictions are scale-dependent i.e. applicable to regional and global scales.Thus, great dispersal abilities coupled with a reasonably longer residence time of the selected suite of IAS, reflects its high likelihood of being in equilibrium with the climate.Regions with red color have 'Type 1' novelty, and blue color have 'Type 2' novelty. Regions in green color represents similar environmental conditions. The 'Type 1' novelty represent points that are outside the range of individual covariates, and 'Type 2' novelty represent the points that are within the individual covariate range but have novel combinations between the covariates.(TIF)Individual colours along with numbers below the colour ramp depict the MIC i.e. the bioclimatic variables. Blue areas in the map, labelled as 'none' in the colour legend, do not have any covariate which falls outside the range of native range bioclimatic data or have any non-analogous combination of these covariates.(TIF)(TIF)(TIF)(DOCX)The values in the table represent the number of pixels (size: ≈ 4 km) under each class.(DOCX)We gratefully acknowledge the logistic support received from the Centre for Advanced Studies in Botany, North-Eastern Hill University (NEHU), Shillong, North-East India Centre of Diversity (NEICOD), and DBT Infrastructure Programme at NEHU, Shillong.
