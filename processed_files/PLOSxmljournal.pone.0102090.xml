It is unclear how these waterfront ecosystems can be sustained, as well as the services they provide, when relative sea-level rise and global warming are expected to exert even greater pressures in the near future (drought, habitat degradation and accelerated shoreline retreat). Haifa Bay, northern Israel, has recorded a landward sea invasion, with a maximum sea penetration 4,000 years ago, during an important period of urban development and climate instability. Here, we examine the cumulative pressure of climate shifts and relative sea-level changes in order to investigate the patterns and mechanisms behind forest replacement by an open-steppe. We provide a first comprehensive and integrative study for the southern Levant that shows that (i) human impact, through urbanization, has been the main driver behind ecological erosion in the past 4,000 years; (ii) climate pressures have reinforced this impact; and (iii) local coastal changes have played a decisive role in eroding ecosystem resilience. These three parameters, which have closely interacted during the last 4,000 years in Haifa Bay, clearly indicate that for an efficient management of the coastal habitats, anthropogenic pressures linked to urban development must be reduced in order to mitigate the predicted effects of Global Change.The study site is denoted by a black star. The maximum marine ingression during the Bronze Age is shown by a dotted line, with the present coastline as reference.The lithology of the core sampled at Akko is detailed and plotted on a linear depth-scale. The arboreal pollen curve from the core is shown as â€œsubtract meanâ€ function and plotted on a linear depth-scale.The polynomial curves indicate the general trend. A variety of vegetation types from the sandy shore (open steppe) to the coastal hinterland (woodland) were selected.The coordinates (Â°N, Â°E), the altitudes and the distances to the sea are given.The pollen-types from each cluster were summed to create pollen-derived vegetation patterns.The selected environmental data are indicated below each graph. The consistency of each reconstructed model is indicated by the R<sup>2</sup>. The lower graph corresponds to a ranking of the environmental data according to the R<sup>2</sup> values.The dendrogram shows the statistical link between one pressure and pollen-derived vegetation patterns, suggesting an environmental relationship between the pressure and the resulting vegetation. Each numerical link between a pressure and a pollen-derived vegetation pattern is denoted by a different colour.The hygrophilous and hydrophilous herbs, expressed as percentages, are displayed as a single curve plotted on a linear timescale. The average value is indicated by a vertical dotted line. The maximum sea ingression is bracketed between the two lines.The long-term environmental evolution of the northern part of Haifa Bay suggests that the future of coastal ecosystems and wetlands in the southern Levant will mainly be mediated by complex interactions between human impacts, climate change and changing coastal geomorphology. This questions human behavior in these fragile coastal systems: how will humans respond to rising relative sea level and increased drought, and how will they produce a sustainable management of coastal ecosystems and wetlands while their encroachment already affects the landscape, through an overexploitation of resources and by an overuse of freshwater. In Haifa Bay, human activities have played an important role during the last 4000 years, by reinforcing and gradually supplanting the natural stressors. Efficient management of the coastal habitats of southern Levant would imply a strong reduction in anthropogenic pressures linked to urban development, in order to mitigate the predicted effects of Global Change. Modern cities in the Levant are undergoing strong demographic growth, but their ongoing expansion needs to carefully assess the environmental limits of local natural resources and ecosystemsâ€™ capacity to respond.(XLSX)(XLSX)(XLSX)(XLSX)We wish to thank Patricia L.
