Distal leg morphology, subgenual organs and host detection in Stephanidae (Insecta, Hymenoptera)The morphology of the tibia and tarsus of all legs is examined in species of two genera of Stephanidae. The subgenual organ (SGO) is examined in more detail for Megischus spp. The fore leg is the most modified in Schlettererius. In Megischus, the SGO of the hind leg is displaced to the middle of the tibia, which is swollen distad of it; in the female the hind tarsi are threeâ€segmented, the basitarsomere being a composite of tarsomeres 1â€“3. Internally, the SGO of Megischus is suspended between a spine and a ridge. In the mid and hind legs, part of the tibial wall is thinner in the region of the SGO. Our observations provide circumstantial evidence that female Stephanidae detect substrateâ€borne vibrations when searching for hosts. The absence of antennal modification, as well as information on host stage targeted and general behaviour on the oviposition site indicates that they rely on noise made by the host rather than generate vibrations themselves, in contrast to Orussidae, a parasitoid wasp taxon that has been inferred to employ vibrational sounding. The external receptor elements â€“ membranous pads versus tufts of setae â€“ are not homologous in Orussidae and Stephanidae. A spine and ridge suspensorium of the SGO found in members of both families may represent a derived groundplan feature of the orussidâ€“apocritan clade, with secondary modification or reduction in the latter group. Characters of the distal leg elements and the SGO suggest a basal position of Schlettererius and Stephanus within Stephanidae. Modifications of the hind tibia and tarsus in more derived members of the family indicate a shift in relative importance in vibration detection from the fore leg to the hind leg within the family.
