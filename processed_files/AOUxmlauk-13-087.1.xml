Because not all species of birds replace all or parts of their juvenal plumage soon after leaving the nest (e.g., many Accipitridae and waterbirds; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Howell1">Howell 2010</xref>) and because first prebasic molts can range from being limited to complete across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Pyle1">Pyle 1997</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Howell2">Howell et al.

(2003)</xref> further suggested that selective pressures led to the subsequent evolution of other molts inserted between prebasic molts, like the preformative molt, and also prealternate and presupplemental molts, defined by the cycle in which they occur (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-t01">Table 1</xref>). Recognizing the number or type of inserted molt(s) within each cycle places every bird into 1 of 4 &ldquo;molt strategies&rdquo; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Howell2">Howell et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Pyle3">Pyle 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Howell1">Howell 2010</xref>).Substantiating H-P-H assumptions is an important step toward more rigorously examining the diversification of feathers and their maintenance through molt that has allowed birds to colonize the Earth's surface. Additionally, understanding the nature of inserted molts would provide insights into why certain avian lineages were more prone to acquiring extra molts, which may have facilitated life-history evolution. For example, there appear to be correlations between migratory behavior and the presence and extent of inserted molts. These extra molts may have arisen to mitigate structural damage associated with a migratory lifestyle and subsequently commandeered to reflect honest signals associated with winter-ground quality through changes in plumage coloration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Svensson1">Svensson and Hedenstr&ouml;m 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Pyle5">Pyle and Kayhart 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Wolfe1">Wolfe and Pyle 2011</xref>).Like other physiological processes and behaviors, molts have presumably resulted from an evolutionary history in which simple adaptations preceded increasingly complex ones. For example, birds molt their feathers at least once a year, so parsimony suggests that an annual molt is a shared characteristic that preceded later inserted molts (which are not shared across taxa) and likely descended from their most recent common ancestor, instead of having evolved multiple times. Although highly variable in timing, this presumably ancestral annual molt is not known to have been lost in any extant birds (although geese may rarely skip an annual molt; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Summers1">Summers 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Summers2">Summers and Martin 1985</xref>), whereas the ability to fly has been lost potentially hundreds of times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Steadman1">Steadman 1989</xref>). Given that variation in molt insertions and in the timing of the annual molt probably aided in the global radiation of birds, we believe that a universal terminology encompassing the diversity of molt will promote collaborative study and a deeper understanding of avian evolution.Here, to move us toward a unified molt terminology, we provide a review of hindrances associated with H-P-H and suggest an analytical framework to address such problems. We also assess ambiguous terminology associated with H-P-H and offer clarifications. Hereafter, to be as consistent as possible, we follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Howell2">Howell et al.'s (2003)</xref> convention for naming molts and plumages (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-t01">Table 1</xref>).Despite H-P-H's potential to improve our understanding of molt and despite its universal applicability, critics noted the system's many evolutionary assumptions, including presumed and untested homologies across, and paralogous annual molts within, species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Willoughby1">Willoughby 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Jenni1">Jenni and Winkler 2004</xref>). Other critiques of H-P-H suggested that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Howell2">Howell et al. (2003)</xref> lacked appreciation for the plasticity of molt, which can obscure homologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Willoughby1">Willoughby 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Jenni1">Jenni and Winkler 2004</xref>). For example, diversity in the number of molts, extent of each molt, and color of the subsequent plumage can be tremendously variable among closely related taxa such as cardueline finches, making the identification of molt homologies difficult, if not impossible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Willoughby1">Willoughby 2004</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Howell1">Howell 2010</xref>). Additional problems included difficulties in verifying <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Howell2">Howell et al.'s (2003)</xref> assumption of paralogy between prejuvenal and later prebasic molts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Willoughby1">Willoughby 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Jenni1">Jenni and Winkler 2004</xref>); even <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Howell2">Howell et al. (2003</xref>:639) suggested that prejuvenal and prebasic molts &ldquo;may be analogous based on a widely shared function&rdquo; rather than resulting from a shared evolutionary history and underlying physiological process. An additional problem associated with H-P-H is variation in the definition of &ldquo;molt strategy,&rdquo; reflecting an inability to differentiate inserted molts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Howell2">Howell et al. (2003)</xref> first defined different molt strategies by determining which inserted molt occurs within a particular cycle (e.g., prealternate or preformative molt within the first cycle; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-t01">Table 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Pyle3">Pyle (2008)</xref> modified the definition of molt strategies by identifying the number of insertions (e.g., 1 or 2 insertions within the first cycle), thereby recognizing an inherent difficulty in distinguishing between first-cycle prealternate and preformative molts in some species (e.g., Ancient Murrelet &lsqb;<italic>Synthliboramphus antiquus</italic>&rsqb;; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Pyle4">Pyle 2009</xref>). Most recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Howell1">Howell (2010)</xref> seemingly hybridized the 2 approaches by defining molt strategy on the basis of number of insertions, which usually correspond to a particular inserted molt, within a given cycle.In response to critics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Howell3">Howell et al. (2004)</xref> reiterated that feather color should not be used to identify homologous molts and that molt homology should be considered &ldquo;comparable,&rdquo; awaiting verification of evolutionary origins when &ldquo;a genetic basis will eventually be discovered that can reveal homologies of molts&rdquo; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Howell3">Howell et al. 2004</xref>:207). Although H-P-H may be correct in assuming that an annual molt is highly conserved, note that timing of development is one of the most variable elements of evolution and that the vast majority of morphological evolution occurs through changes in developmental timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-WestEberhard1">West-Eberhard 2003</xref>). We propose that the evolution of molt should be studied under the framework of heterochrony, or changes in timing of developmental events. Developmental events and associated regulatory genes are evolutionarily malleable and easily duplicated, and molt is a physiologically complicated process. Repeated annual molts in birds are likely paralogous, and inserted molts may be the result of duplication and modification of an ancestral molt. On the basis of these realizations, we believe that 2 questions must be addressed to verify H-P-H assumptions and move toward a universally accepted system of molt terminology: (1) What was the ancestral molt? (2) How many times and why have inserted molts arisen?One major obstacle in testing H-P-H assumptions is the determination of whether the prejuvenal and later prebasic molts are paralogous within, and homologous across, taxa. Within species, the relationship between prejuvenal and prebasic molts may represent a synapomorphic character or, conversely, 2 independently derived traits with respect to other molts. Distinguishing between these possibilities is difficult because every known bird species has a molt resembling the prejuvenal and prebasic molt, which limits our ability to analyze variation within a phylogenetic framework. If the prejuvenal and prebasic molts evolved independently deep in evolutionary time, then regulation of prejuvenal and prebasic molts may operate independently and might be assessed through transcriptomic analysis. Such an analysis could sample a diversity of species and molts to assess how dissimilar molts are activated within and across species. Results of a transcriptomic analysis experiment would cluster molts by their expression profile, allowing analysts to determine expression and genetic similarities of molts within an individual. Despite apparent potential for transcriptomic analysis, we realize that molt is likely determined by many genes, gene duplication, or manipulation in the timing of events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Carroll1">Carroll 2008</xref>), thereby complicating molecular analysis focused on determining the evolutionary relationship of paralogous molts within a species.Despite inherent difficulties in examining evolutionary relationships of paralogous molts within species, variation in patterns of the prebasic molt may shed some light on this issue. All birds molt their feathers simultaneously during the prejuvenal molt, and many groups of birds molt remiges simultaneously as adults (e.g., Gaviidae, Rallidae, Anatidae, Alcidae, and Gruidae; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Pyle3">Pyle 2008</xref>). This retention of a juvenile trait into adulthood may be viewed as an example of neoteny. The fact that simultaneous molt, when exhibited in adults, is expressed during prebasic molts and never during the preformative or prealternate molts provides evidence for ancestral relationship and physiological connection between the prejuvenal and prebasic molts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Pyle3">Pyle 2008</xref>). Because parsimony and similarities in feather replacement strongly suggest a shared evolutionary origin of annual molts (prebasic and prejuvenal) within species, the number and extent of inserted molts (preformative, prealternate, and presupplemetal molts; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-t01">Table 1</xref>) between prebasic molts can be examined as characters throughout a phylogeny to estimate relationships between similar molts in different species, in much the same way that behavior is examined by ethologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Greene1">Greene and Burghardt 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-f02">Figure 2</xref>). Testing this assumption would determine whether multiple insertions within molt cycles (e.g., prealternate and preformative molts) in gulls (Laridae) and warblers (Parulidae) are the result of 1 or multiple evolutionary events. Realistically, finding single origins for inserted molts across all bird taxa is not likely and does not render the fundamental concept of H-P-H nomenclature invalid; it would only necessitate new definitions of inserted preformative, prealternate, and presupplemental molts reflecting their homoplasy.Schematic illustrating our proposed analysis whereby molt insertions are associated with individual species, across a phylogeny, to ascertain whether insertions denote synapomorphies across distantly related taxa. Our schematic is based on the phylogeny proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Sibley1">Sibley and Ahlquist (1990)</xref>.In addition to testing H-P-H assumptions, ambiguous molt terminology associated with H-P-H must be clarified. In particular, the term &ldquo;definitive&rdquo; is used in 4 different contexts: (1) plumage maturation (<italic>definitive plumage</italic>), (2) molts that produce a fully maturated plumage (<italic>definitive molt</italic>), (3) molts that have paralogous counterparts in subsequent cycles (<italic>definitive molt</italic>), and (4) cycles that include only molts with paralogous counterparts in subsequent cycles (<italic>definitive molt cycle</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Humphrey1">Humphrey and Parkes 1959</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Rimmer1">Rimmer 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Heise1">Heise and Rimmer 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Howell2">Howell et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Pyle3">Pyle 2008</xref>). Originally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Humphrey1">Humphrey and Parkes (1959)</xref> suggested the term &ldquo;definitive&rdquo; to describe maturated plumages; unfortunately, using &ldquo;definitive&rdquo; in its original context is confusing, as exemplified by White-crowned Manakins (<italic>Dixiphia pipra</italic>). In the first cycle, these manakins undergo a partial preformative molt, resulting in a green bird with some retained juvenal feathers for the remainder of the first cycle. The second prebasic molt is complete in extent, resulting in green males and females without retained juvenal plumage. After the third prebasic molt, females remain green (and are identical to second basic females), but males transition to a striking black and white plumage that is either fully maturated or becomes fully maturated after the fourth prebasic molt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Ryder1">Ryder and Dur&atilde;es 2005</xref>). Therefore, despite being the same age, female White-crowned Manakins enter a &ldquo;definitive plumage&rdquo; (sensu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Humphrey1">Humphrey and Parkes 1959</xref>) 1 or 2 yr before males, even though a &ldquo;definitive molt&rdquo; or &ldquo;definitive cycle&rdquo; commences with the second prebasic molt in both sexes. Some other species, such as Wrentit (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Chamaea fasciata</named-content></italic>), undergo a complete preformative molt that results in a fully maturated plumage aspect, similar to second and later basic plumages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Pyle1">Pyle 1997</xref>). These 2 examples demonstrate that a definitive plumage could result from a definitive preformative, second prebasic, third prebasic, or fourth prebasic molt; thus, the term &ldquo;definitive&rdquo; as currently used is context dependent and confuses a discussion of evolutionary relationships across and even within species.We believe that using &ldquo;definitive&rdquo; to describe plumage maturation violates the spirit of H-P-H, in which 1 molt results in 1 plumage and is not used to classify plumage aspect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Howell2">Howell et al. 2003</xref>). Presumably on the basis of this realization, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Pyle3">Pyle (2008</xref>:13) used molts with paralogous counterparts in subsequent cycles to define definitive molts as attaining &ldquo;stasis in terms of extent and timing, irrespective of plumage aspect.&rdquo; It may seem natural to define definitive molts as having paralogous counterparts in subsequent cycles (sensu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-3-371-Pyle3">Pyle 2008</xref>); however, this definition presents inconsistencies where the prejuvenal molt, presumed to be paralogous with later prebasic molts, might be considered definitive but is followed by a preformative molt that lacks counterparts in subsequent cycles. We suggest that molt and plumage terminology should be consistently applied across taxa to better reflect presumed evolutionary history and, thus, recommend that &ldquo;definitive&rdquo; be used only in the context of describing molt cycles and the molts that occur within them, irrespective of plumage aspect. In this context, the second molt cycle would represent the definitive molt cycle in most birds and, therefore, individual molts occurring within the second and later cycles should be considered definitive.In conclusion, H-P-H is a unique system of nomenclature because, like systematics and taxonomy, it strives to base molt terminology on the evolutionary history of the subject. However, no major attempt has been made to validate the evolutionary framework in which H-P-H classifies molt. To move toward molt nomenclature consensus, the evolutionary assumptions of H-P-H must be tested and the terminology solidified. Through phylogenetic analyses and a stronger understanding of underlying physiological and genetic controls of assumed prebasic molts, researchers will begin to subject the H-P-H system to continual refinement, thereby providing novel insights into avian evolution and natural history.Thanks to P.
