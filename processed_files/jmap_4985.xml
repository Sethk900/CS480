On the â€œParactinolaimusâ€ genus group (Nematoda: Actinolaimidae), with description of five new and two rare species of Egtitus Thorne, 1967Five genera of the family Actinolaimidae, subfamily Actinolaiminae are united in the â€œParactinolaimusâ€ genus group. Four of them, Egtitus, Nothactinolaimus, Stopractinca and Westindicus are characterized, and their species are listed. Five new species are described with illustrations of both female and male sexes: Egtitus africanus sp. nov. from South Africa, Egtitus remotus sp. nov. from Papua New Guinea, Egtitus chilenus sp. nov. from Chile, Egtitus biformis sp. nov. and Egtitus longicaudatus sp. nov. from Papua New Guinea. The taxonomic position of Egtitus elaboratus (Cobb, 1906) is discussed. The first records since their original descriptions of two rare species, Egtitus bryophilus Thorne, 1967 (type of the genus) from Peru and Egtitus neocyatholaimus (Kreis, 1936) from Papua New Guinea. Identification keys to species of Egtitus and Westindicus are provided and some new combinations are proposed.
