Thank You to the Reviewers of the 2015 <italic>Condor</italic>, Volume 117<email xlink:type="simple">pstouffer@lsu.edu</email>We are now concluding our second full year as <italic>The Condor: Ornithological Applications</italic>. We are pleased that the ornithological community has responded favorably to our modern look and redefined mission. As our numbers of submissions have increased, so has the work necessary for the peer review process. Our peer reviewers are the foundation of our scientific integrity. Despite little personal gain, 222 colleagues lent their expertise for the benefit of our journal and our discipline during the period that volume 117 was in preparation (reviews completed between September 1, 2014, and August 15, 2015). Individuals identified with asterisks were especially dedicated; they reviewed two, three, or even four manuscripts. On behalf of <italic>The Condor: Ornithological Applications</italic>, I thank all of you for your timely and conscientious work. Managing reviewers is mostly the job of Associate Editors, whose names appear on the masthead. Their work, along with the efforts of our two fine Editors and the tireless professional staff at the Central Ornithology Publication Office (COPO), allows us to be proud of the journal we collectively produce.
