Vertical distribution and abundance of arthropods from white sand soil of a Neotropical Campinarana forest during the dry seasonAbout 58,000 arthropods per m2 soil were extracted in a dryland forest on white sand soil (campinarana) near Manaus, Brazil, during the dry season in mid 1988. About 63% of all arthropods lived in the top 3.5 cm, 21% underneath (3.5–7 cm depth), and only 16% in 7–14 cm depth. Acari and Collembola represented more than 75% of the total catch. Decreasing abundance was significantly correlated with lower soil temperature and lower soil humidity at greater soil depth. Vertical distribution of arthropods corresponded with data obtained during the rainy season in early 1988 from the same forest and with results already known from other neotropical dryland forests. No indication is found yet that arthropods of Central Amazonian dryland forests migrate to the subsoil as a response to changing abiotic factors in the upper layer due to seasons, as reported from forests in the seasonal tropics.
