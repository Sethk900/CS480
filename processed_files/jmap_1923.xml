The growth respiration component in eddy CO2 flux from a Quercus ilex mediterranean forest.Ecosystem respiration, arising from soil decomposition as well as from plant maintenance and growth, has been shown to be the most important component of carbon exchange in most terrestrial ecosystems. The goal of this study was to estimate the growth component of whole-ecosystem respiration in a Mediterranean evergreen oak (<em>Quercus ilex</em>) forest over the course of 3 years. Ecosystem respiration (<em>R</em><sub>eco</sub>) was determined from night-time carbon dioxide flux (<em>F</em><sub>c</sub>) using eddy correlation when friction velocity (<em>u</em><sub>*</sub>) was greater than 0.35 m s<sup>-;1</sup>
