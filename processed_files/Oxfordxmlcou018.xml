We examined the effects of elements from a remediated fly ash spill on nestling tree swallow physiology. Nestlings were exposed to modestly elevated concentrations of elements including selenium near the spill. Bacteria killing capacity was positively related to selenium exposure, but element exposure was unrelated to other aspects of physiology.  Anthropogenic activities often produce pollutants that can affect the physiology, growth and reproductive success of wildlife. Many metals and trace elements play important roles in physiological processes, and exposure to even moderately elevated concentrations of essential and non-essential elements could have subtle effects on physiology, particularly during development. We examined the effects of exposure to a number of elements from a coal fly ash spill that occurred in December 2008 and has since been remediated on the stress and immune responses of nestling tree swallows. We found that nestlings at the site of the spill had significantly greater blood concentrations of Cu, Hg, Se and Zn in 2011, but greater concentrations only of Se in 2012, in comparison to reference colonies. The concentrations of elements were below levels of significant toxicological concern in both years. In 2011, we found no relationship between exposure to elements associated with the spill and basal or stress-induced corticosterone concentrations in nestlings. In 2012, we found that Se exposure was not associated with cell-mediated immunity based on the response to phytohaemagglutinin injection. However, the bactericidal capacity of nestling plasma had a positive but weak association with blood Se concentrations, and this association was stronger at the spill site. Our results indicate that exposure to these low concentrations of elements had few effects on nestling endocrine and immune physiology. The long-term health consequences of low-level exposure to elements and of exposure to greater element concentrations in avian species require additional study.  Humans are rapidly altering the environment and while these changes may threaten the persistence of species and populations ( Vitousek  et al. , 1997 ), they may also have subtle, non-lethal effects on individuals. Exposure to anthropogenic pollutants can affect physiology ( Acevedo-Whitehouse and Duffus, 2009 ;  Martin  et al. , 2010 ), compromise reproductive performance ( Heinz, 1996 ;  Baos  et al. , 2012 ) and affect development of vertebrates ( Markman  et al. , 2011 ). Elements, including heavy metals, metalloids and trace elements, are one form of pollution that wildlife are exposed to through a number of anthropogenic processes, such as intensive agriculture ( Ohlendorf  et al. , 1986 ;  OrÅ‚owski  et al. , 2010 ), mining ( Weech  et al. , 2012 ), coal combustion ( Rowe  et al. , 2002 ) and metal smelting ( Janssens  et al. , 2001 ). Some of these elements are of known toxicological importance, such as arsenic (As), lead (Pb) and mercury (Hg), as well as elements that are nutritionally important but become toxic at elevated concentrations, such as copper (Cu), iron (Fe), selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn). At optimal dietary concentrations, the latter elements affect a variety of physiological processes, acting as enzyme cofactors and antioxidants and enhancing the immune response ( Reilly, 2006 ;  Wintergerst  et al. , 2007 ). However, at higher concentrations they can cause oxidative stress ( Janz  et al. , 2010 ;  Koivula and Eeva, 2010 ), increase susceptibility to infection ( Sherman, 1992 ;  Wintergerst  et al. , 2007 ) and inhibit reproductive performance ( Baos  et al. , 2012 ). Given the important physiological functions of elements, individuals may be more sensitive to element contamination during early development, when exposure could permanently alter some physiological processes ( Nyholm, 1998 ;  Baos  et al. , 2006a ). Thus, exposure to even moderately elevated concentrations of some elements during development may affect physiological processes, such as stress and immune responses, which are directly relevant to survival and reproduction.  The stress response is one aspect of physiology that may be affected by exposure to elements. This response is regulated by the hypothalamicâ€“pituitaryâ€“adrenal axis (HPA axis), which controls the release of glucocorticoids in vertebrates ( Wingfield and Romero, 2001 ). Basal glucocorticoid concentrations are responsible for regulating energy balance, blood glucose and fatty acid levels (reviewed by  Landys  et al. , 2006 ), while stress-induced glucocorticoids are released in response to unexpected challenges and cause changes in behaviour and physiology that enhance the probability of survival (reviewed by  Wingfield  et al. , 1998 ;  Sapolsky  et al. , 2000 ). Exposure to elements can potentially affect the regulation of glucocorticoids via an array of mechanisms acting on different levels of the HPA axis. For example, release of glucocorticoids can be affected by altering the release of, or response to, corticotrophin-releasing hormone or adrenocorticotrophic hormone from the hypothalamus and pituitary, respectively ( Potmis  et al. , 1993 ;  Handy, 2003 ;  Gagnon  et al. , 2006 ). Elements such as Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn are also important components of many enzymes ( Marmiroli and Maestri, 2008 ), and increases in their concentrations above normal dietary levels could potentially affect enzymes associated with glucocorticoid metabolism ( Hopkins  et al. , 1997 ).  Given that elements have the potential to influence the production, release and clearance of glucocorticoids, it is not surprising that studies examining the effects of elements on basal and stress-induced glucocorticoid concentrations have produced mixed results. For example, in some avian studies, Hg exposure may reduce ( Franceschini  et al. , 2009 ;  Herring  et al. , 2012 ) or elevate basal glucocorticoid concentrations ( Wada  et al. , 2009 ). Basal glucocorticoid concentrations have not been significantly associated with mixtures of elements, including cadmium (Cd), Hg and Se [common eiders ( Somateria mollissima ), Wayland  et al. , 2003], As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn [white storks ( Ciconia ciconia ), Baos  et al. , 2006a], or As, Cu, nickel (Ni), Pb and Zn [pied flycatchers ( Ficedula hypoleuca ),  Eeva  et al. , 2005 ], but Cd, Se and Hg may influence basal glucocorticoids in interactions with other elements or body condition [lesser scaup ( Aythya affinis ), Pollock and Machin, 2009]. Effects on induced glucocorticoid concentrations produced using standardized handling restraint are also variable. Exposure to elements including Pb and Cd can enhance the stress-induced release of glucocorticoids ( Wayland  et al. , 2002 ;  Baos  et al. , 2006a ), while exposure to Hg and Se can inhibit it ( Wayland  et al. , 2002 ;  Wada  et al. , 2009 ). In these same or very similar studies, other elements, including As, Cd, Hg, Se and Zn, appeared to have no effect on stress-induced glucocorticoids ( Wayland  et al. , 2002 ,  2003 ;  Baos  et al. , 2006a ). Given that animals may be exposed to a variety of elements that may interact in complex ways ( Marmiroli and Maestri, 2008 ;  Zwolak and Zaporowska, 2012 ), it is important to understand how elements commonly found in the environment influence the HPA axis as well as other physiological processes.  Exposure to elements can also affect immune responses and disease resistance. Many immune responses are affected by nutritional condition ( Alonso-Alvarez and Tella, 2001 ;  Lifjeld  et al. , 2002 ;  Ponton  et al. , 2013 ), and exposure to high concentrations of elements may reduce an individual's nutritional condition and hence their immune response ( Ritchie  et al. , 1994 ;  MassÃ¡nyi  et al. , 1999 ). Element exposure may directly affect the immune system by impairing immune cell function, altering protein synthesis, or through cytotoxic effects on immune organs ( Koller, 1973 ;  Blakley  et al. , 1980 ;  Dan  et al. , 2000 ). Exposure to elements such as Pb increases disease prevalence in house sparrows ( Passer domesticus ,  Bichet  et al. , 2013 ), providing indirect evidence that element exposure impairs immunity. Exposure to elevated concentrations of Pb or a mixture of elements including As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Hg, Se and Zn was associated with reduced humoral immunity [zebra finch ( Taeniopygia guttata ) and great tit ( Parus major ),  Snoeijs  et al. , 2004 , 2005], while cell-mediated immunity can be impaired by exposure to Hg in tree swallows ( Tachycineta bicolor ,  Hawley  et al. , 2009 ). However, other studies have detected no effect of these same elements on humoral ( Wayland  et al. , 2003 ;  Biser  et al. , 2004 ;  Hawley  et al. , 2009 ) or cell-mediated immunity ( Snoeijs  et al. , 2005 ;  Baos  et al. , 2006b ), and a few studies have even detected stimulatory effects of Se exposure on these immune responses ( Wayland  et al. , 2002 ;  Surai, 2006 ;  Brady  et al. , 2013 ). Robust innate and cell-mediated immune responses require adequate dietary concentrations of Cu, Fe, Se and Zn (reviewed by  Maggini  et al. , 2007 ;  Wintergerst  et al. , 2007 ), and it is possible that moderate increases in these elements, below levels associated with toxic effects, are responsible for the enhanced immune responses detected in some studies.  We examined the effects of environmental exposure to a mixture of elements from a recently remediated coal fly ash spill on the stress and immune responses of nestling tree swallows. Coal fly ash is one of the largest solid waste streams produced globally and represents a significant source of an array of elements to aquatic systems ( Rowe  et al. , 2002 ;  NRC, 2006 ). Fly ash spills, such as the one that took place at our study site, represent extreme circumstances, but aquatic disposal of fly ash continually introduces elements into streams and rivers around the world. Fly ash contains elevated concentrations of several elements including As, Hg, Se, V and others that pose health risks to humans and wildlife ( Rowe  et al. , 2002 ;  NRC, 2006 ). At the time of our study, remediation efforts at our site were largely completed and the concentrations of elements in this system were below levels associated with negative effects on reproduction or survival in many avian species ( Ohlendorf, 2003 ;  Dauwe  et al. , 2005 ;  Brasso and Cristol, 2008 ). However, we hypothesized that exposure during development to low concentrations of elements associated with coal fly ash would affect avian physiology. In light of the discrepancies amongst study systems highlighted above, we focused on the relationship between element exposure and the HPA axis and immune responses in an effort to contribute to this growing body of literature.  Tree swallows are one of the primary model species used to address the movement of contaminants from aquatic to terrestrial ecosystems ( Custer, 2011 ) and are used extensively in field studies of physiology, life history and behaviour ( Robertson  et al. , 2011 ). Tree swallows are aerial insectivores and, when breeding in riparian areas, feed primarily on emerging aquatic insects ( Custer  et al. , 2010 ;  Custer, 2011 ;  Beck  et al. , 2013 ). A few studies have examined the effects of one element, Hg, on the stress and immune responses of tree swallows. Some of these studies have detected reduced basal corticosterone concentrations with greater Hg exposure ( Franceschini  et al. , 2009 ) and others increased basal but reduced stress-induced corticosterone concentrations with greater Hg exposure ( Wada  et al. , 2009 ). The cell-mediated immune response was negatively affected by exposure to Hg, but Hg exposure did not affect the humoral immune response ( Hawley  et al. , 2009 ). Although these studies demonstrated that Hg exposure related to aspects of tree swallow physiology, no studies have examined the effects of many of the elements found in fly ash on the immune or stress responses of tree swallows.  In December 2008, a coal fly ash impoundment at the Tennessee Valley Authority fossil plant in Kingston, TN, USA (35.8722Â°N, 84.5250Â°W) ruptured, releasing 4.1 million m  3   of coal fly ash slurry into the Emory River, which then flowed into the Clinch and Tennessee Rivers ( TVA, 2009 ). In the 2.5â€…years following the spill, most of the coal fly ash was removed from the river system but âˆ¼400â€…000â€…m  3   remained at the time of our study ( TVA, 2011a ).  Tree swallow colonies located near Kingston, TN, USA. The study area consisted of two highly impacted colonies located on the Emory River. One was located at the site of the spill (spill site, SS,  n â€…=â€…94) and the second at the confluence of the Clinch and Emory River (downstreamâ€…1, D1,  n â€…=â€…31) 4â€…km downstream from the spill. Two moderately impacted colonies were located on the Clinch River at downstreamâ€…2 (D2,  n â€…=â€…31) and downstreamâ€…3 (D3,  n â€…=â€…43) and were 3.0 and 7.0â€…km, respectively, downstream from the confluence with the Clinch River. A low-impacted colony was located downstream on the Tennessee River (D4,  n â€…=â€…51) 2.5â€…km from the confluence with the Clinch and Tennessee Rivers. We used three reference colonies; two were located near Lenoir City, TN, USA 30.5â€…km east of Kingston. Referenceâ€…1 (R1,  n â€…=â€…46) was located at Ft Loudoun Dam on the Tennessee River and referenceâ€…2 (R2,  n â€…=â€…53) at Tellico Dam on the Little Tennessee River. Referenceâ€…3 was located on Long Island (R3,  n â€…=â€…53) on the Tennessee River 5.5â€…km upstream from the confluence with the Clinch River. We also placed boxes at Melton Hill Dam (MD,  n â€…=â€…68) on the Clinch River, which served a role analogous to a positive control. The sites MD, R1 and R2 are not pictured here.  n  refers to the number of nest boxes located at each colony. River kilometres are given in each river.  We placed clean nest boxes in each area when tree swallows were arriving at the breeding grounds and prospecting for nest sites. All of the colonies were established at least 1â€…year prior to this study except for D1, which we established in 2011. Nest boxes were 25â€…cmâ€…Ã—â€…20â€…cmâ€…Ã—â€…41â€…cm with a 2.5â€…cm entrance hole and were mounted 1.5â€…m above the ground on metal conduit. All entrances were oriented toward the water, and boxes were located within 70â€…m of the shore to facilitate foraging on emerging aquatic insects. We spaced nest boxes 15â€…m apart when in a single row, or 20â€…m apart with a staggered alignment of two or more rows. We checked nest boxes every 4â€…days, beginning in late March, for signs of nesting activity and to obtain basic reproductive data. When nestlings were 13â€…days old, we banded them and obtained blood samples for the corticosterone assay, immune challenge or element analysis (see below). For each nestling, we measured the length of the left and right tarsus (each tarsus was measured twice) and body mass.  In 2011, we examined the effect of element exposure on the stress response of 13-day-old nestlings by subjecting them to a standardized handling stress protocol (after  Wingfield and Romero, 2001 ). We obtained a blood sample (âˆ¼60â€…Î¼l) from up to half of the nestlings in a brood within 3â€…min of disturbing the box. These nestlings were then held alone in a cloth bag for 30â€…min, after which a second blood sample was obtained. Samples were stored in a cooler containing ice blocks before being centrifuged for 5â€…min at 9783  g , and the plasma fraction was removed and stored at âˆ’20Â°C in the field-house and stored long-term at âˆ’80Â°C.  In the autumn of 2011, we randomly selected plasma from one nestling from each nest that we subjected to the handling stress protocol and quantified basal and induced corticosterone concentrations in 125 nestlings across all colonies. By using a single sample per nest, we avoided issues with pseudoreplication. We used Enzo Life Sciences enzyme immunoassay kits (catalogue no. 901-097) using a procedure previously validated for tree swallows by  Wada  et al.  (2009) . We haphazardly distributed samples from different colonies equally across 10 96-well plates. We diluted 12â€…Î¼l of plasma with an equal volume of 3% steroid displacement buffer and then diluted samples 1:20 with assay buffer. On each plate, a standard curve that ranged from 15.6 to 2000â€…pg/ml was run in triplicate. A 500â€…pg/ml corticosterone standard was also run in triplicate on each plate, and each plasma sample was run in duplicate. The assay had a detection limit of 1.1â€…ng/ml, and any samples ( n â€…=â€…49) that fell below this were assigned half of the detection limit for their corticosterone concentration. Samples that fell below the detection limit were equally distributed among Melton Hill, the spill site, downstream and reference colonies (Ï‡ 2 â€…=â€…3.04, d.f.â€…=â€…3,  P â€…=â€…0.385) and assays (Ï‡ 2 â€…=â€…8.55, d.f.â€…=â€…7,  P â€…=â€…0.287). Three nestlings had induced corticosterone concentrations that were below the detection limit, and we ran statistical tests including and excluding these samples. We calculated intra-assay variation as the average coefficient of variation between duplicate samples on each plate and inter-assay variation as the coefficient of variation among the standards on every plate. Intra-assay variation was 11.2% and inter-assay variation 13.3%.  We examined the effects of elements on aspects of the immune response in nestling tree swallows in June and July 2012. We randomly selected a single nestling from each nest to avoid issues with pseudoreplication. We quantified the response of 37 13- to 14-day-old tree swallow nestlings to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA; Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) by injecting the patagium (wing web) of nestlings with 0.15â€…mg of PHA dissolved in 30â€…Î¼l of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; after  Smits  et al. , 1999 ). The injection of PHA leads to a localized swelling due to the influx and proliferation of Tâ€…cells and leukocytes at the injection site ( Martin  et al. , 2006 ) and a build-up of free radicals that are produced during phagocytosis by components of the innate immune system ( Peretz, 1989 ). Feathers were first cleared from the wing web, and the area was sterilized using 70% ethanol. One individual held the nestling with its right wing extended in a standardized position, while a second individual (J.J.H.) made all measurements and performed the injections. Prior to and 24â€…h following injection, the thickness of the wing web was quantified to the nearest 0.01â€…mm using a micrometer. To avoid bias, the micrometer dial was not visible to the measurer while making the measurement. We made five pre- and five post-injection measurements at the injection point, discarded the lowest and highest values in each set and used the remaining three values to produce average pre- and post-injection thicknesses. We divided the difference between the post- and pre-injection measurements by the pre-injection measurement and multiplied this value by 100 to calculate the percentage increase in swelling caused by the injection and used this as our measure of the cell-mediated immune response.  We examined innate immunity in nestlings by evaluating the bactericidal capacity of plasma ( Liebl and Martin, 2009 ). Blood samples were obtained from 96 nestlings, one from each nest, 13â€…days post-hatch. The area around the puncture site was cleansed with 70% ethanol prior to blood collection from the brachial vein. We collected 120â€…Î¼l of blood in heparinized capillary tubes; 60â€…Î¼l was reserved for element analysis and the other 60â€…Î¼l used to assess bactericidal capacity. Samples were stored in coolers with ice packs in the field (â‰¤4â€…h) and were refrigerated prior to being centrifuged (â‰¤2â€…h) at 9783  g  for 5â€…min for the bactericidal assay. The plasma fraction was placed in a sterile 0.5â€…ml tube and refrigerated until all samples gathered that day were centrifuged. All samples were run on the day of collection in order to minimize degradation. The majority of samples were run in triplicate and occasionally duplicate ( n â€…=â€…2) by diluting 3.5â€…Î¼l of plasma with 31.5â€…Î¼l of sterile PBS (1:10 dilution). We added 12.5â€…Î¼l of 10 5 â€…bacteria/ml  Escherichia coli  solution (ATCC 8739, E power  microorganisms; Microbiologics Â® , Stâ€…Cloud, MN, USA) to each tube and vortexed each sample. Samples were incubated at 37Â°C for 30â€…min, then 250â€…Î¼l of tryptic soy broth (TSB; Sigma Aldrich ) was added to each tube, and samples were incubated for an additional 12â€…h at 37Â°C. Positive controls were prepared in triplicate by adding 12.5â€…Î¼l of 10 5 â€…bacteria/ml  E. coli  solution to 250â€…Î¼l of TSB, and we prepared duplicate blanks by combining 50â€…Î¼l of PBS with 250â€…Î¼l of TSB. We prepared an additional control in duplicate that contained 3.5â€…Î¼l of plasma, 250â€…Î¼l of TSB and 50â€…Î¼l of PBS to check that bacteria were not introduced during bleeding or sample processing.  Following the 12â€…h incubation, samples were vortexed, and a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer (ND-2000; Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) was used to measure the absorbance of each sample at an optical density of 300â€…nm ( Liebl and Martin, 2009 ). The absorbance of each sample and the positive controls were each averaged and used to calculate the proportion of bacteria killed as one minus (average sample absorbance/average positive control absorbance). The Nanodrop arm was cleansed between each sample with 70% ethanol, and the entire work area was cleansed with ethanol before and after each work day.  Blood samples from nestlings were shipped overnight on dry ice to the Trace Element Analysis Core at Dartmouth College (Hanover, NH, USA). Concentrations of As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Hg, Se, Sr, Tl, V and Zn present in blood were quantified for each sample using inductively coupled mass spectrometry following EPA method 6020A ( EPA, 2008 ). Samples were digested using an open vessel acid digestion with 0.5â€…ml of 9:1 HNO 3 :HCl (Optima, Fisher Scientific, St Louis, MO, USA) using microwave heating at 105Â°C for 45â€…min. After cooling, 0.1â€…ml H 2 O 2  was added to the samples and they were taken through a second heating step (adpated from  EPA, 1996 ). The samples were then diluted to 10â€…ml with deionized water. Digested samples were analysed for element concentrations by collision cell inductively coupled mass spectrometry (7700x; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Concentrations of As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Sr, Tl, V and Zn (He collision mode), Se (reaction mode) and Hg (normal mode) were quantified in each sample. Digestion quality control measures included digestion blanks, fortified blanks and reference materials at a frequency of one each per 20 samples. There was insufficient blood to allow for digestion of duplicates or spikes. Analytical sample duplicates and spikes were performed at a frequency of one each per 20 samples. Additional quality control consisted of reporting limit checks, interference checks and initial and continuing calibration checks and blanks.  Mean values and standard errors for blood element concentrations (in micrograms per gram wet mass) in nestling tree swallows among colonies in 2011 and 2012  Concentrations of several elements were below the detection limit (2011 detection limit/2012 detection limit) in both years and were not considered further, as follows: As (0.009/0.006), Cd (0.009/0.007), Cr (0.098/0.088), Tl (0.009/0.001) and V (0.016/0.015). Number of nests sampled at each colony, 2011: referenceâ€…=â€…30, Melton Hill Damâ€…=â€…20, spill siteâ€…=â€…24 and downstreamâ€…=â€…51; and 2012: referenceâ€…=â€…22, Melton Hill Damâ€…=â€…18, spill siteâ€…=â€…23, and downstreamâ€…=â€…33 (2011 d.f.â€…=â€…3, 121; 2012 d.f.â€…=â€…3, 92). Abbreviations: BDL, below detection limit; and NA, not assessed.  We used Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov tests and normality plots to determine whether variables met the assumptions of parametric tests. Element concentrations and basal and induced corticosterone concentrations were not normally distributed and were log transformed prior to analysis, which successfully normalized the data. We first compared element concentrations among colony types (reference, spill site, downstream and Melton Hill) using a MANOVA followed by univariate ANOVAs and Tukey's tests to determine which elements were significantly elevated in the system due to the fly ash spill. Only elements that were found at the spill site at significantly higher concentrations than all reference colonies were included in the analysis that examined the effects of element exposure on the stress and immune responses of nestlings. Given that Hg concentrations were BDL in 2012 and Mn concentrations were BDL in 2011, we made these comparisons separately for each year. We calculated body condition for nestlings as the residuals of a regression of mass on tarsus length ( r  2 â€…=â€…0.243, d.f.â€…=â€…124,  P â€…&lt;â€…0.001 ) . While the use of residuals as a measure of body condition is controversial ( Green, 2001 ), studies have shown that residuals do correlate well with lipid reserves ( Ardia, 2005 ;  Schulte-Hostedde  et al. , 2005 ) and other studies have shown that residual body mass is related to the immune and the stress responses in avian species ( Pollock and Machin, 2009 ;  Palacios  et al. , 2012 ).  We used linear regressions and backward elimination of non-significant terms to examine the effects of clutch initiation date, element concentrations, body condition and two-way interactions between condition and element concentrations on the immune and stress responses of nestlings. We eliminated non-significant interaction terms first, followed by main effects that were not significantly related to physiology. We allowed terms to remain in the model as long as  P â€…â‰¤â€…0.10, but considered their contribution to be statistically significant only when  P â€…â‰¤â€…0.05. For the stress response, we performed separate regressions with basal and induced corticosterone as the dependent variables because these two parameters represent distinct physiological responses that engage different receptor types ( Kloet, 1991 ). To examine the immune responses, we used the percentage of bacteria killed and wing web swelling as dependent variables. Given that much of the variance in element concentrations, particularly for Se, was attributable to variation at the spill site, we ran an additional iteration of any statistically significant model that focused only on samples collected at this colony. Given that element concentrations and colony type were confounded in the analysis, we did not include colony type in the regression models. Rather, we also compared corticosterone concentrations and immune responses among colony types using an ANCOVA, with clutch initiation date included as a covariate. All statistical tests were two-tailed, with Î±â€…=â€…0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using PASWâ€…18 ( SPSS, 2009 ).  We first compared concentrations of elements among the four colony types, i.e. reference, the spill site, downstream and Melton Hill. In 2011, we found that concentrations of Ba and Sr did not differ significantly among colony types (Table  1 ; all  P â€…â‰¥â€…0.10). However, we found that Cu, Fe, Hg, Se and Zn concentrations differed significantly among colonies, and  post hoc  tests indicated that the spill site had greater concentrations than the reference colonies for all of these elements ( P â€…â‰¤â€…0.001) except for Fe ( P â€…=â€…0.47). Given that only Cu, Hg, Se and Zn were significantly elevated at the spill site in comparison to reference colonies, we focused on the effect of these elements on the basal and induced plasma corticosterone concentrations of nestlings. Copper, Se and Zn concentrations were not significantly correlated with each other (all  r â€…â‰¤â€…0.11, all  P â€…â‰¥â€…0.23), but Hg concentrations correlated positively with Cu ( r â€…=â€…0.27,  P â€…=â€…0.002) and were almost significantly correlated with Se concentrations ( r â€…=â€…0.16,  P â€…=â€…0.07). In order to reduce the number of tests performed while avoiding issues with collinearity, we performed two separate backward elimination regressions with different combinations of the elements, one that included Cu, Se and Zn and a second that used only Hg.  In 2012, we found that concentrations of Ba and Cu did not differ significantly among colony types (Table  1 ; all  P â€…â‰¥â€…0.06). Concentrations of Fe, Mn, Sr and Zn differed significantly among colony types, but not in ways that indicated an association with the fly ash spill.  Post hoc  tests indicated that concentrations of Fe, Mn, Sr and Zn were significantly greater at reference colonies than those at the spill site (all  P â€…â‰¤â€…0.05). Only concentrations of Se remained significantly elevated at the spill site in comparison to reference colonies ( P â€…&lt;â€…0.001). Thus, all of the immune challenge analyses focused on nestling blood Se concentrations.  Mean values and standard errors for stress and immune responses in nestling tree swallows among colonies  The stress response was quantified in 2011, while the immune responses were quantified in 2012. Least-squares means are given for basal and induced corticosterone concentrations because Julian clutch initiation date had a significant influence on both the basal and induced corticosterone concentrations. Basal and induced corticosterone, d.f.â€…=â€…3, 120; phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), d.f.â€…=â€…3, 33; and bactericidal killing assay (BKA), d.f.â€…=â€…3, 92.  n  refers to the number of nests sampled at each colony.  Full and reduced model results from multiple regressions examining the effects of element exposure on the stress responses of nestling tree swallows  From the full model, we used backward elimination, beginning with interaction terms, to remove terms that did not contribute significantly to the model fit until only statistically significant terms remained. Basal and induced corticosterone models converged on the same final models (indicated by â€˜bothâ€™ in the table) that included only nestling condition or clutch initiation date, respectively. For the analysis, induced corticosterone models exclude the three individuals with induced corticosterone concentrations below the assay detection limit; however, including these individuals produced nearly identical results.  Full and reduced model results from multiple regressions examining the effects of selenium exposure on the immune responses of nestling tree swallows  From the full model, we used backward elimination, beginning with interaction terms, to remove terms that did not contribute significantly to model fit. Abbreviations: BKA, bactericidal killing assay; PHA, phytohaemagglutinin; SS, spill site.  The relationship between Se exposure and bactericidal capacity in nestling tree swallows at the spill site. Higher Se concentrations were strongly associated with greater bactericidal capacity at this colony ( r  2 â€…=â€…0.40, d.f.â€…=â€…21,  P â€…=â€…0.001). Analyses were performed with log-transformed Se concentration, but we show untransformed data for clarity.  We examined the effects of exposure to elements from a recently remediated coal fly ash spill on the stress and immune responses of nestling tree swallows. We found that nestlings were exposed to elevated concentrations of some elements, particularly Se, at the spill site. However, we found no evidence of adverse effects on nestling physiology associated with the remediated fly ash spill. Element exposure was not related to the stress response of nestling tree swallows and was unrelated to a measure of the cell-mediated immune response. Only bactericidal capacity was affected by element exposure; greater exposure to Se was weakly associated with enhanced bactericidal capacity among all of the colonies, but strongly associated with Se exposure at the spill site. Overall, we suggest that remediation efforts and natural processes (e.g. offsite transport and dilution) in the years following the spill have left only modest concentrations of elements in the system and these low concentrations do not adversely affect the immune and stress physiology of swallows.  In 2011, we found that nestlings at the spill site were exposed to elevated concentrations of Cu, Hg, Se and Zn in comparison to nestlings in reference colonies, while in 2012, nestlings at the spill site were exposed to elevated Se only. Selenium is the primary driver of ecological risk in systems polluted by fly ash, and we found that even 4â€…years after the spill and massive remediation efforts, nestlings at the spill site were exposed to concentrations of Se elevated above those of reference colonies. However, most blood Se concentrations at the spill site were below concentrations typically associated with reduced survival or condition in avian species ( Ohlendorf and Heinz, 2011 ). Blood Se concentration at the spill site ranged between 1.08 and 2.83â€…Î¼g/g wet mass in 2011 and between 0.78 and 3.36â€…Î¼g/g wet mass in 2012. Blood Se concentrations above 1.0â€…Î¼g/g wet mass are considered a threshold level for concern (reviewed by  Ohlendorf and Heinz, 2011 ), but many studies detect effects on adult survival or body mass only at blood Se concentrations above 5.0â€…Î¼g/g wet mass ( Heinz and Fitzgerald, 1993 ). However, blood Se concentrations within a range similar to those found in our study have been associated with reduced body mass in captive American kestrels ( Falco sparverius ) fed high-Se diets ( Yamamoto and Santolo, 2000 ) and with signs of oxidative stress in emperor geese ( Chen canagica ,  Franson  et al. , 2002 ). All of these studies were conducted in laboratory animals that were exposed to Se in their diet for a minimum of 11â€…weeks ( Heinz and Fitzgerald, 1993 ;  Yamamoto and Santolo, 2000 ;  Franson  et al. , 2002 ). In our study, nestlings were exposed to elevated Se levels for only 13â€…days prior to sampling, and this may be why we found no negative physiological effects of these concentrations of Se when other researchers have.  Mercury, copper and zinc are other important elements found in some sources of fly ash, depending on the parent coal composition and combustion procedures used at power plants ( Rowe  et al. , 2002 ;  NRC, 2006 ). In 2011 at the spill site, Hg concentrations in swallow blood ranged from 0.004 to 0.025â€…Î¼g/g wet mass. These concentrations are one-14th of the concentrations that caused physiological effects in a study by  Wada  et al.  (2009)  at a highly Hg-contaminated site in Virginia. Indeed, our highest Hg concentration is comparable to those found in blood samples at the reference colonies, 0.017â€…Î¼g/g wet mass, in the study by  Wada  et al.  (2009) . Concentrations of Cu and Zn at the spill site are largely similar to concentrations of these elements found in white storks, in studies that detected few effects of these elements on physiology ( Baos  et al. , 2006a ,  b ).  Consistent with the low observed exposure to elements experienced by swallows in our remediated study system, we found no evidence of adverse physiological effects on the HPA axis. Basal and stress-induced corticosterone concentrations of swallows in this system were not related to element exposure. Indeed, corticosterone concentrations of swallows from impacted colonies were similar to the corticosterone concentrations found at reference sites in other studies ( Franceschini  et al. , 2008 ,  2009 ;  Wada  et al. , 2009 ). We did find subtle differences in basal and induced corticosterone concentrations among colony types, but not between the spill site and reference colonies, indicating these differences are not related to the fly ash spill. Downstream colonies had significantly higher basal corticosterone concentrations than reference colonies, and induced corticosterone concentrations were significantly higher at downstream colonies than those at the spill site and reference colonies. It is likely that the slight differences in corticosterone concentrations at downstream colonies are related to subtle ecological differences among colonies, such as resource availability, rather than contaminant exposure.  Likewise, we found few effects of elements from the fly ash spill on the immune response of nestling tree swallows. We found no differences among colonies in either the response to PHA injection or bactericidal capacity. We expected that blood Se concentration would affect the immune response, because adequate dietary concentrations of Se are necessary for robust innate and acquired immune responses ( Maggini  et al. , 2007 ;  Wintergerst  et al. , 2007 ). However, we found no relationship between the blood Se concentrations and the nestling response to PHA injection. Adult common eiders fed a high-Se diet had blood Se concentrations &gt;8â€…Î¼g/g wet mass and produced smaller swellings in response to PHA injection than control birds ( Franson  et al. , 2007 ). Thus, higher Se concentrations and more prolonged exposure than found in our study may influence this aspect of immunity. In contrast, we found that the bactericidal capacity of nestling plasma, an assay of innate immunity, showed a strong, positive relationship to their blood Se concentration at the spill site, and there was a weak association when all colonies were included in the analysis. The bacteria-killing capacity of plasma reflects several aspects of the innate immune response, including the ability of complement enzymes and lysozyme to destroy cell walls and lyse cell membranes of bacteria (reviewed by  Matson  et al. , 2006 ). The selenoenzyme thioredoxin reductase influences the regulation and expression of genes involved in the innate and adaptive immune responses (reviewed by  Maggini  et al. , 2007 ). It is possible that exposure to slightly elevated concentrations of Se enhanced the expression of genes associated with innate immunity and enhanced bactericidal capacity. In fish fed supplemental Se, lysozyme activity is enhanced ( Lin and Shiau, 2007 ), and this may have contributed to the enhancement of bactericidal capacity that we detected.  Overall, our results indicated that nestling tree swallows near the spill site were exposed to modest increases in element concentrations from a recently remediated fly ash spill. Exposure to low element concentrations was largely unrelated to several aspects of physiology in nestling tree swallows. It is currently unknown whether exposure to elements during development has long-term effects on physiology in adulthood or how chronic exposure to low element concentration may be related to physiology. Future studies should address the long-term effects of element exposure on physiology, particularly aspects of physiology that could ultimately affect recruitment and survival of young or future reproductive success. Additionally, concentrations of similar combinations of elements would be much higher in active fly ash settling basins ( Bryan  et al. , 2012 ), potentially putting swallows and other taxa attracted to these sites at greater risk of exposure and physiological effects. In the near future, concentrations of Hg and other heavy metals in fly ash are expected to increase as new clean air regulations reduce air emissions by coal-burning power plants and increase the concentration of these elements in the solid waste stream ( USEPA, 2012 ). Thus, the hazards posed by fly ash are projected to increase in the future, warranting disposal procedures that minimize its potential to contaminate ground and surface water in order to prevent exposure and adverse effects in wildlife.
