A second species of Oculogryphus (Coleoptera, Lampyridae), with notes on the phylogenetic affinities of the genusAbstract A second species of the enigmatic lampyrid genus Oculogryphus is described and figured as Oculogryphus bicolor sp. n. from Vietnam. The definition of the genus is slightly modified with consideration of newly detected morphological variation from this species. According to a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis including nearly 80% of documented lampyrid genera, Oculogryphus is the putative sister group to Stenocladius s. str. within the paraphyletic group of Ototretinae-Ototretadrilinae.The classification of Stenocladius is briefly discussed in this context.
