Water-Distribution Systems Simplifications through ClusteringAbstractFor large water-distribution systems fully detailed models result in a substantial amount of data, making it difficult to manage, monitor, and understand how the main structure of the system works. A possible way to cope with this difficulty is to gain insight to the system behavior by simplifying its operation through topological/connectivity analysis. The objective of this study is to develop and demonstrate a generic topological-based scheme to aid in the analysis of water-distribution systems. The methodology relies on clustering, which divides the distribution system into strongly and weakly connected sub-graphs using the depth first search (DFS) and breadth first search (BFS) graph algorithms. The partitioning results in a connectivity matrix that represents the interconnections between clusters, which can support, for example, a response modeling plan in case of a contamination intrusion incident. A detailed illustrative example and a real complex water-distribution system are explored for demonstrating the developed model capabilities. Possible applications of the proposed algorithm are suggested.
