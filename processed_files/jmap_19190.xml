Soil respiration under different land-use types in a hilly area of South ChinaBy using closed static chamber and gas chromatography (HP5890 II), the soil respiration and CO2 evolution in a coniferous forest land and an orchard land in hilly area of South China were measured. The results showed that land use type had significant effect on soil respiration. The annual mean soil respiration of coniferous forest land with and without litters was (1.96 +/- 0.09) and (1.60 +/- 0.07) kg.m(-2).a(-1), while that of orchard land was (6.56 +/- 0.32) and (5.30 +/- 2.80) kg.m(-2).a(-1), respectively. Similar pattern was observed on the seasonal variation of soil respiration under the two land-use types, i.e., higher in rainy season and lower in dry season. Soil respiration was positively correlated with air temperature and the temperature on soil surface and at the depth of 5 cm, and its Q(10) values varied from 1.73 to 3.30. There was a significant correlation between soil respiration and soil moisture content. The variation of soil temperature and moisture content could partly explain the seasonal variation of soil respiration under two land-use types. The contribution of litter decomposition to the CO, evolution from coniferous forest land and orchard land accounted for 18.14% and 19.08% of the total, respectively.
