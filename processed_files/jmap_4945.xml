Status of the family-group names of Arachnida first published in Band I, Abtheilung 1 of Berendt's Die im Bernstein befindlichen organischen Reste der Vorwelt (1845)The status of the arachnid names published in Berendt's 1845 work Die im Bernstein befindlichen organischen Reste der Vorwelt (Band I, Abtheilung 1) is reassessed. All of the new generic and specific names introduced there are nomina nuda. However, the family names Eresidae (Araneae), Eriodontidae (Araneae), Mithraeidae (Araneae) and Sarcoptidae (Acari: Actinotrichida) were all validly proposed and should be attributed to C.L. Koch in Berendt (1845). Two of these family names are currently in use: Eresidae C.L. Koch in Berendt (1845) (previously attributed to C.L. Koch, 1851) and Sarcoptidae C.L. Koch in Berendt (1845) (previously attributed to Murray, 1877), along with the coordinate superfamily names Eresoidea C.L. Koch in Berendt (1845) and Sarcoptoidea C.L. Koch in Berendt (1845).
