ASTER and field observations of the 24 December 2006 eruption of Bezymianny Volcano, RussiaAn explosive eruption occurred at Bezymianny Volcano (Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia) on 24 December 2006 at 09:17 (UTC). Seismicity increased three weeks prior to the large eruption, which produced a 12â15Â km above sea level (ASL) ash column. We present field observations from 27 December 2006 and 2 March 2007, combined with satellite data collected from 8 October 2006 to 11 April 2007 by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), as part of the instrument's rapid-response program to volcanic eruptions. Pixel-integrated brightness temperatures were calculated from both ASTER 90Â m/pixel thermal infrared (TIR) data as well as 30Â m/pixel short-wave infrared (SWIR) data. Four days prior to the eruption, the maximum TIR temperature was 45Â Â°C above the average background temperature (â33Â Â°C) at the dome, which we interpret was a precursory signal, and had dropped to 8Â Â°C above background by 18 March 2007. On 20 December 2006, there was also a clear thermal signal in the SWIR data of 128Â Â°C using ASTER Band 7 (2.26Â Î¼m). The maximum SWIR temperature was 181Â Â°C on the lava dome on 4 January 2007, decreasing below the detection limit of the SWIR data by 11 April 2007. On 4 January 2007 a hot linear feature was observed at the dome in the SWIR data, which produced a maximum temperature of 700Â Â°C for the hot fraction of the pixel using the dual band technique. This suggests that magmatic temperatures were present at the dome at this time, consistent with the emplacement of a new lava lobe following the eruption. The eruption also produced a large, 6.5Â km long by up to 425Â m wide pyroclastic flow (PF) deposit that was channelled into a valley to the southâsoutheast. The PF deposit cooled over the following three months but remained elevated above the average background temperature. A second field investigation in March 2007 revealed a still-warm PF deposit that contained fumaroles. It was also observed that the upper dome morphology had changed in the past year, with a new lava lobe having in-filled the crater that formed following the 9 May 2006 eruption. These data provide further information on effusive and explosive activity at Bezymianny using quantitative remote sensing data and reinforced by field observations to assist in pre-eruption detection as well as post-eruption monitoring.
