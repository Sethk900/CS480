Observations on the Breeding Biology of Male Sage GrouseEighty-eight male sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) were collected throughout the 1959 strutting season. Testis development of adult and subadult males was compared to observed seasonal breeding sequence. Subadult males appear on the strutting grounds after, and cease strutting activities before, adult males. These differences in apparent breeding activity between the two age- classes are supported by similar differences in testis development. Observations of infertility in late clutches suggest that a limitation to renesting is imposed by the male.
