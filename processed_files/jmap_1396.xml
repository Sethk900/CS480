A Strategy for Restoration of Montane Forest in Anthropogenic Fern Thickets in the Dominican Republic.Deforested tropical areas are often colonized by competitive ferns that inhibit forest succession. In thickets of such a fern (<em>Dicranopteris pectinata</em>), we investigated methods for initiating restoration of tropical montane forest in the &Eacute;bano Verde Scientific Reserve (Dominican Republic). In clearings in the thickets, growth and survivorship of 18 common early- and late-successional woody species were tested, with and without fertilizer (poultry litter). Three years after sowing, life history did not affect survivorship, but early-successional species grew faster than late-successional species (height increase 153 ± 103 cm vs. 81 ± 67 cm [mean ± 1 SD]). <em>Inga fagifolia</em>, a late-successional species, and <em>Alchornea latifolia</em>, an early-successional species, had 160 ± 62 cm mean height increase, and low mortality rates (<4%). In contrast, four late-successional species (<em>Cyrilla racemiflora, Myrcia deflexa, Prestoea acuminata</em> var. <em>montana</em>, and <em>Mora abbottii</em>), and one early-successional species, <em>Ocotea leucoxylon,</em> had approximately 39% mortality and height increase of 43 ± 48 cm. <em>Brunellia comocladifolia</em> had high mortality (55%), but averaged 340 ± 201 cm height increase, and was the only species whose growth was improved by fertilization. Fertilization improved survivorship of only one species, <em>Piper aduncum</em>. After three years, soils in the clearings had low pH and available P and did not differ significantly from soils in thickets. However, based on the growth rates and survivorship of sown woody plants, these soils did not appear to be a barrier for restoration. Although a complementary study demonstrated substantial natural regeneration, active planting should be used to increase plant density and diversity, especially where natural regeneration is poor.
