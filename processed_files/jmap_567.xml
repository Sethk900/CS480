Heliotropium europaeum only germinates following sufficient rainfall to allow reproduction.Regions with Mediterranean climates are seasonally arid and provide a niche for ephemeral species which germinate following discrete and variable rainfall during summer. These species must be able to detect when conditions are suitable for completion of their life cycle. Common heliotrope (Heliotropium europaeum) is one such species. It is considered a weed in its naturalised habitat in southern Australia as it uses resources that could be used by ensuing crops, and is toxic to livestock.
