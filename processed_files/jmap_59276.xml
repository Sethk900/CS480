Discharge Coefficient Analysis for Triangular Sharp-Crested Weirs Using Low-Speed Photographic TechniqueAbstractTriangular weirs are commonly used to measure discharge in open channel flow, representing an inexpensive, reliable methodology to monitor water allocation. In this work, a low-speed photographic technique was used to characterize the upper and lower nappe profiles of flow over fully aerated triangular weirs. A total of 112 experiments were performed covering a range of weir vertex angles (from 30° to 90°), crest elevations (8 or 10 cm), and discharges (0.01–7.82  l s−1). The experimental nappe profiles were mathematically modeled and combined with elements of free-vortex theory to derive a predictive equation for the weir discharge coefficient. Comparisons were established between measured Cd, the proposed discharge coefficient equation, and discharge coefficient equations identified in the literature. The proposed equation predicts Cd with a mean estimation error (MEE) of 0.001, a root-mean square error (RMSE) of 0.004, and an index of agreement (IA) of 0.984. In the experimental conditions of this study, this performance slightly improves that of the equation proposed by Greve in 1932, and showed the same absolute value of MEE but lower values of RMSE and IA.
