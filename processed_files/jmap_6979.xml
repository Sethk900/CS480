Systematics and Biogeography of Scaled Woodcreepers (Aves: Dendrocolaptidae)The geographical variation of three qualitative plumage characters and three body measurements of populations of the Scaled Woodcreeper (Lepidocolaptes squamatus), a species whose range is centered in eastern Brazil, is analyzed. Three distinctive populations are recognized (wagleri, squamatus, and falcinellus). Under the biological species concept (BSC), two species are recognized (L. squamatus, including squamatus and wagleri as subspecies; and L. falcinellus). Under either the phylogenetic species concept (PSC) or under the evolutionary species concept (ESC), the three distinctive populations should be regarded as independent species. Based on plumage similarities, we suggest that squamatus and wagleri form a monophyletic group, with falcinellus as its sister-group. Geological changes (tectonism and formation of river courses) are suggested as causal factors that promoted speciation in Scaled Woodcreepers.
