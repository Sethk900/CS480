Arthropods from the canopy of inundated and terra firme forests near Manaus, Brazil, with critical considerations on the pyrethrum‚Äfogging techniqueSamples of arthropods in canopies of selected trees were collected by pyrethrum‚Äfogging during the early part of the 1977 dry season from three types of neotropical forest: v√°rzea and igap√≥ forest which are inundated seasonally by white‚Äwater and black‚Äwater rivers respectively, and terra firme forest which is not subject to inundation. Sampling areas were within 30 km of Manaus, Brazil. Number and biomass of arthropods sampled was highest in terra firme, intermediate in igap√≥ and lowest in v√°rzea. Ants were dominant on all sites and a high percentage of their species were found only in one type of forest. It is considered that many taxa are incompletely sampled with the fogging technique. Further statements on the canopy fauna of Central Amazonian forest types should be based on fogging data gathered from all seasons and compared with material sampled with other methods at the same time and locality.
