Gametes have a unique potential to enter the sporophytic pathway, called androgenesis. The plants produced are usually haploid and recombinant due to the preceding meiosis and they can double their chromosome number to form doubled haploids (DHs), which are completely homozygous. The present study demonstrates that reprogramming occurs in the isolated microspores at tetrad stage as the first step if androgenesis and this is paving the way for the development of an efficient technique for the production of homozygous lines in cassava. This is the first ever detailed report of microspore reprogramming at the tetrad stage and the first report of microspore embryogenesis induction in cassava with detailed evidence.  Gametes have the unique potential to enter the sporophytic pathway, called androgenesis. The plants produced are usually haploid and recombinant due to the preceding meiosis and they can double their chromosome number to form doubled haploids, which are completely homozygous. Availability of the doubled haploids facilitates mapping the genes of agronomically important traits, shortening the time of the breeding process required to produce new hybrids and homozygous varieties, and saving the time and cost for inbreeding. This study aimed to test the feasibility of using isolated and  in vitro  cultured immature cassava ( Manihot esculenta ) microspores to reprogramme and initiate sporophytic development. Different culture media and different concentrations of two ion components (Cu 2+  and Fe 2+ ) were tested in two genotypes of cassava. External structural changes, nuclear divisions and cellular changes during reprogramming were analysed by scanning electron microscopy, by staining with 4â€²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and through classical histology and transmission electron microscopy. In two cassava genotypes, different developmental stages of microspores were found to initiate sporophytic cell divisions, that is, with tetrads of TMS 60444 and with mid or late uni-nucleate microspores of SM 1219-9. In the modified NLN medium (NLNS), microspore enlargements were observed. The medium supplemented with either sodium ferrous ethylene-diamine-tetraacetic acid (NaFeEDTA) or CuSO 4 Â·5H 2 O induced sporophytic cell division in both genotypes. A low frequency of the reprogramming and the presence of non-responsive microspores among the responsive ones in tetrads were found to be related to the viability and exine formation of the microspores. The present study clearly demonstrated that reprogramming occurs much faster in isolated microspore culture than in anther culture. This paves the way for the development of an efficient technique for the production of homozygous lines in cassava. This is the first ever detailed report of microspore reprogramming at the tetrad stage and the first report of microspore embryogenesis induction in cassava with detailed evidence.  The life cycle of plants consists of a very long sporophytic phase and a much shorter gametophytic phase. Cells of the latter phase have the unique potential to enter the sporophytic pathway, i.e. embryogenesis, without fertilization once they are reprogrammed by appropriate triggers and cultured  in vitro  ( Forster  et al.  2007 ). This fascinating example of phase transition during the alternation of generations in plants is called androgenesis ( Raghavan 1986 ). The plants produced are usually haploid and recombinant due to the preceding meiosis, but they can double their chromosome number to form doubled haploids, which are completely homozygous. Efficient methods to establish doubled haploid lines are essential for researchers to map genes of agronomically important traits as well as for breeders to shorten the time of the breeding process required to produce new hybrids and homozygous varieties. The introduction of an efficient doubled haploid production system saves time and cost over conventional inbreeding.  Although anther culture is the most common technique for the production of haploid plants, microspore culture is more efficient since thousands of microspores can be cultured on a single tissue culture plate. Moreover, microspore culture avoids the formation of calli or embryos from somatic tissues of the anthers as reported in cassava ( Manihot esculenta ) ( Perera  et al.  2014 ), giving rise only to plants that are haploids or doubled haploids. Direct access to the microspores speeds up the optimization of culture conditions, and the entire process of microspore embryogenesis can easily be monitored under an inverted microscope ( Polsoni  et al.  1988 ;  Graner 1996 ). High frequencies of embryo formation and plantlet regeneration in isolated microspore cultures have been obtained in only a few plant species, such as tobacco, rapeseed, barley, wheat and rice ( JÃ¤hne and LÃ¶rz 1995 ;  Palmer  et al.  1996 ;  Touraev and Heberle-Bors 2003 ), even though microspore embryogenesis has been reported to occur in more than 250 plant species ( Maluszynski  et al.  2003 ). Compared with other methods of doubled haploid formation, that is, gynogenesis and pollination with irradiated or alien pollen, microspore embryogenesis has become a better choice for haploid breeding in several economically interesting crops ( Chupeau  et al.  1998 ;  Datta 2005 ).  Fundamentally, cassava ( M. esculenta ) is a crop able to grow on marginal lands. It has a considerable potential to eliminate hunger in the poor world, especially in Asia, Africa and Latin America. With the threat of climate change, this crop has been recognized as being highly resilient to future climatic changes ( Jarvis  et al.  2012 ). Apart from its culinary value, it plays a major role in the starch industry ( Davis  et al.  2003 ) since starch can easily be extracted from its roots because of their low levels of protein and fat ( Munyikwa  et al.  1997 ), thus reducing the processing cost. Furthermore, the quality of cassava starch enables its use in various industries ( Zhao  et al.  2011 ). With the increasing demand for renewable energy, cassava is one of the major crops that can be used to produce bioethanol with minimum processing cost. With these trends, increasing research is currently being carried out to improve this crop. Two natural cassava starch mutations have been reported recently: amylose-free waxy starch through inbreeding ( Ceballos  et al.  2007 ) and small-granule, high-amylose starch through induced mutation with Î³-rays ( Ceballos  et al.  2008 ). Furthermore, cassava has been biofortified with additional nutrients such as Î²-carotene and vitamin A ( La Frano  et al.  2012 ), which is beneficial to people living in poverty in Asia, Africa and Latin America. However, crop improvement is hampered by the heterozygous nature of the crop. A stronger pipeline for the production of homozygous cassava lines would greatly enhance the number of new cassava varieties not only with further added nutritional value, pest and disease resistance, and high yield but also by improving the crop in different novel dimensions. Asparagus cassava is an example of a new form of cassava that was produced by inbreeding of cassava and which greatly increased planting density (Hernan Ceballos, pers. comm.).  Our laboratory recently published a reproducible method for microspore-derived callus production via anther culture ( Perera  et al.  2014 ). However, an efficient protocol for plant regeneration is yet to be developed. Evidence was provided for cassava microspores being able to enter the sporophytic pathway within the anther, and genetic tests established that the callus lines produced were of microspore origin. Earlier research on haploid induction from cassava microspores by anther culture ( Moh 1975 ;  Mukherjee 1996 ;  Woodward and Puonti-Kaerlas 2001 ;  Chirinos  et al.  2006 ;  Xi  et al.  2009 ) has been inconclusive in terms of origin or ploidy.  Microspore reprogramming for triggering the sporophytic pathway from its normal gametophytic pathway is the first step in the establishment of a microspore culture technique. The most critical factors affecting this transition are the genotype and growth conditions of the donor plants, collection of buds in the optimal stage, stress treatments, as well as the composition of the culture medium and culture conditions ( Perera  et al.  2008 ;  Irikova  et al.  2011 ). Here, we report that the most responsive microspore developmental stages for reprogramming into sporogenic microspores are different in two cassava genotypes, that is, the tetrad stage and the free microspore stage. We also report the development of a novel medium for cassava microspore culture. Light and electron microscopic studies characterized the reprogramming process and allowed us to identify difficulties encountered in the reprogramming process.  Two cassava genotypes, SM 1219-9 and TMS 60444 (hereafter designated as SM and TMS), were used to optimize the culture conditions for microspore culture as the first step in the production of doubled haploids. The donor plants were grown in three locations at the headquarters of the International Center for Tropical Agriculture. Year-round flower bud production was obtained by maintaining the plants with sprinkler irrigation and fertilizer application. Manual weed control and biological pest control were practised in order to maintain the plants with minimal chemical application.  Inflorescences were picked before 0900 h, and flower buds ranging from 2.0 to 2.8 mm in diameter were collected. The number of buds required was determined based on the calculation of 50 buds per 10 mL of medium on a culture plate (60 mm Ã— 15 mm). The selected buds were disinfected under aseptic conditions with 70 % ethanol for 1 min, followed by a 10 % clorox solution containing 30 ÂµL Tween-20 for 20 min in two changes. Then the buds were rinsed four times with sterile distilled water (Milli-Q Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The isolated buds were given a cold pretreatment at 10 Â°C for 3 days in the dark. After pretreatment, the buds were used for microspore isolation.  Up to 400 buds were used for a single isolation of microspores. The buds were placed in a Waring commercial blender (Eberbach Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) together with a 10 % sucrose solution and were blended for 20 s at low speed. The resulting suspension was passed through filters made of nylon mesh (Spectrum Â®  Laboratories, Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA, USA) with different pore sizes. Anther debris was removed by ï¬ltering the blend through 149-Âµm mesh. The resulting suspension containing microspores and smaller debris was then filtered with 104-, 70- and 41-Âµm meshes sequentially and the cells remaining on each mesh were collected separately to different 15-mL falcon tubes with 10 mL of 10 % sucrose solution. Different sucrose concentrations (10, 20 or 30 %, either independently or by layering), centrifugation speeds (1000 and 500 rpm; Kubota, Tokyo, Japan) and times (0.5, 1 and 5 min) were tested to optimize the isolation and purification protocol. Then the isolated microspores were suspended in a 10 % sucrose solution or culture medium by adjusting the volume to be dispensed to a density of 5 Ã— 102 per mL. Each Petri plate (60 Ã— 15 mm) contained 10 mL of liquid culture medium. All the activities were performed in a laminar flow cabinet under aseptic conditions.  In a pilot study, the microspore response of the extracts of 70 and 41 was tested using five different culture protocols with different culture media, namely, modified MS developed for cassava anther culture ( Perera  et al.  2014 ), B/AT3 (as described by  Touraev and Heberle-Bors 1999 ), NLNS preculture medium followed by the complete culture media NLN basal medium (as described by  Kim  et al.  2008 ), and NLN and NLNS medium supplemented with 10 % sucrose, 800 mg L âˆ’1  glutamine and 12 mg L âˆ’1  picloram. Microspores were cultured in the latter two media after applying 3 days of cold pretreatment at 10 Â°C whereas the relevant temperatures as described in the protocols were used for the first two protocols.  After adjusting the pH to 5.8, all media were sterilized by ï¬ltration through 0.45-Âµm Nalgene Â®  disposable bottle-top filters (Thermo Scientificâ„¢ Nalgeneâ„¢ Rapid-Flow). After filter sterilization, timentin (Sigma Aldrich, Lyon, France) was added at a concentration of 160 mg L âˆ’1  to control contamination. Culture plates were sealed with Paraï¬lm and incubated at 28 Â°C in the dark. The cultures were observed under an inverted microscope (Olympus IMT-313, Tokyo, Japan) and pictures were taken with a digital colour camera (MotiCam5 of 5.0, Richmond, Canada).  Two experiments were conducted to increase the frequency of reprogramming microspores using additional ion concentrations supplemented to the above-mentioned modified NLNS medium. In the first experiment, three concentrations of sodium ferrous ethylene-diamine-tetraacetic acid (NaFeEDTA), 45.88, 64.20 and 82.50 mg L âˆ’1 , were compared with the normal concentration of 27.50 mg L âˆ’1  in the basal medium. The experiment was repeated six times. In the second experiment, CuSO 4 Â·5H 2 O, in concentrations of 0.255, 0.260, 0.265, 0.280 and 0.300 mg L âˆ’1 , was tested over the concentration available in the basal medium, that is, 0.250 mg L âˆ’1 . The experiment was repeated 10 times.  Microscopic observations of the cultures were made at daily intervals during the first week and then at weekly intervals. The microspores with altered aspects, mainly enlargement, were considered as the reprogrammed ones. The average reprogramming rate of the cultured microspores was calculated as the number per hundred flower buds. Data presented were representative of a minimum of 2000 microspores observed per time point in at least six independent experiments as specified under each experiment. Mean values Â± SD of the frequencies of reprogramming were calculated. The significance of the differences in mean values of the treatments in each experiment was tested using the statistical package SAS ( SAS Institute 1999 ). Chi-square or maximum likelihood ANOVA was conducted using the PROC CatMod Procedures of PC/SAS. The treatment means were compared with the control treatment based on standard error, 95 % confidence intervals or orthogonal contrast coefficients ( Compton 1994 ). All experiments were analysed as a completely randomized design.  Viability of the microspores in the different steps or time points was assessed by using fluorescein-diacetate (FDA) and Alexander staining. Fluorescein-diacetate-stained microspores were observed under an epi-fluorescence microscope (Ernst Leitz Wetzlar GmbH Leitz, Wetzlar, Germany; excitation 490â€“512 nm, emission 515â€“535 nm) whereas tetrads stained with Alexander staining were observed under the same microscope without fluorescence. Ten slides were prepared at each step and the counts were scored from three fields of each slide. Counts were made according to the number of viable microspores available in the tetrads and then the percentage was calculated over the total tetrads. At least a total of about 500 tetrads were counted at each step. The experiment was repeated two times.  Four samples containing freshly collected, enlarged and non-responsive (unchanged) microspores in genotype SM and responsive microspores from TMS were examined. The samples were first fixed in 2.5 % glutaraldehyde (in 0.1 mol L âˆ’1  phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) overnight at 4 Â°C, and post-fixed in aqueous osmium tetroxide (1 %) for 1 h. The samples were then washed three times with distilled water and dehydrated in a graded ethanol series (25, 50, 75, 90 and 100 %, three times). Critical-point drying was performed in a Samdri-78-A (Tousims Research Corporation, Rockville, MD, USA). The dried specimens were mounted onto aluminium cylinders, and gold was sputtered in a Hummer VII sputtering system (Anatech Ltd, Union City, CA, USA). Samples were observed with a scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM820, Tokyo, Japan). Images were captured using a Nikon D3000 in a Taylor adaptation system (M.E. Taylor Engineering Inc., MD, USA). More than a thousand tetrads and microspores were screened in each sample.  The nuclear status of cultured tetrads and microspores of genotypes TMS and SM was assessed by 4â€²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma Aldrich) staining. Cultures and fresh samples were transferred to an Eppendorf tube and the culture medium was removed after centrifugation. The pelleted microspores were then fixed in Farmer's solution (ethanol : glacial acetic acid = 3 : 1, v/v) overnight at 4 Â°C. The fixative was decanted after centrifugation and washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer (1Ã—; pH 7.4) by centrifugation at 500 rpm for 1 min. The pellet was suspended in DAPI (100 ng mL âˆ’1 ) in 1Ã— PBS buffer and incubated for 10 min in the dark. The exine of microspores of SM was digested according to  Wang  et al.  (2011)  prior to the DAPI staining procedure. Observations were made using light and epi-fluorescent microscopy (Ernst Leitz Wetzlar GmbH Leitz) with 340 nm excitation and 488 nm emission.  For histological analyses, microspores isolated from 50 buds in each of the following conditions were evaluated. Fresh microspores isolated just after collecting the buds and after application of cold pretreatment for 3 days at 10 Â°C were sampled. After inoculating the isolated tetrads or microspores in modified NLNS medium, sampling was performed at 1-, 3-, 5- and 7-day intervals. Another analysis was conducted with genotype SM to test whether there was any correlation between enlargement and reprogramming of the microspore. From the cultures, enlarged microspores &gt;104 Âµm in diameter and in the range of 104â€“70 Âµm were sampled 1 week after culture initiation. Samples were fixed overnight in FAA (50 % ethanol : 10 % formaldehyde : glacial acetic acid = 18 : 1 : 1) and then dehydrated through a graded ethanol series (10, 20, 30, 50, 70, 80, 90, 95 and 100 %, v/v) and 100 % butanol for 30 min, changing each solution twice at 15-min intervals. After fixation, samples were embedded in Technovit 7100 Â®  resin (Heraeus Kulzer GmbH, Wehrheim, Germany). Sections of 3-Î¼m thickness were obtained using a rotary microtome (Histostat; Reichert Scientific Instruments, Buffalo, NY, USA), and five slides were prepared for each sample. Slides were stained with periodic acid Schiff's reagent (Sigma Aldrich) for starch (pink in colour) and naphthol blue black for proteins (blue in colour). All sections were studied under a light microscope (DM500; Leica GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) and photographed with an attached camera (ICC50HD; Leica GmbH).  Four samples containing freshly collected, enlarged and non-responsive (unchanged) microspores in SM and responsive cultures from TMS were examined. The microspores were fixed in 2.5 % glutaraldehyde (in 0.1 mol L âˆ’1  phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) overnight at 4 Â°C and post-fixed in aqueous osmium tetroxide (1 %) for 1 h. After three washings with distilled water, the microspores were embedded in 1 % (w/v) agar for easy handling. Dehydration was performed in 25, 50 and 75 % ethanol for 20 min. Specimens were immersed in 2 % uranyl acetate (in 75 % ethanol) for 12 h at room temperature, followed by further dehydration in 90 % (1 bath) and 100 % ethanol (3 baths) and acetone (3 baths) for 20 min. After fixing the microspores with acetone-Spurr epoxy resin (DER Â®  736; Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA, USA) (1 : 1) followed by pure resin for 1 h (3 changes,  Spurr 1969 ), samples were embedded in resin polymerizing at 65 Â°C for 16 h. Ultra-thin sections obtained with the PowerTome X ultra-microtome (RMC, Tucson, AZ, USA) with a diamond knife at 70 nm were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate ( Reynolds 1963 ). The sections were examined with a transmission electron microscope (JEOL JM1010), and the images were captured and analysed using AnalySIS 3.0 software (Soft Imaging System GmbH, MÃ¼nster, Germany).  Among the tested culture media, a positive response was observed only in the modified NLNS medium supplemented with 10 % sucrose, 800 mg L âˆ’1  glutamine and 12 mg L âˆ’1  picloram. Cultured microspores remained unresponsive in all the other media tested. Thus, the experiments were continued with the modified NLNS medium.  Morphological aspects of isolated microspores from genotype SM1219-9 of  M. esculenta . (A) The suspensions consisted of microspores of black (b) colour having a well-developed exine captured in the 70â€“ to 104-Âµm extract. (B) Microspores with partially synthesized exine (pse) of less intense black and slightly synthesized exine (sse) in yellowish brown in the 41â€“ to 70-Âµm extract.  Morphological changes were observed in the cultured microspores only in extract 70, whereas the 104 and 41 extracts remained unchanged without any observable response, even though the cultures were maintained for as long as 4 months. Different reprogramming responses were obtained from the 70 extract in the two genotypes tested: a significant enlargement of the microspores in tetrads in TMS, and enlargement of free microspores (the diameter being &gt;104 Âµm, the upper limit of the diameter of this group of extract) in SM. Even though enlarged free microspores in TMS and enlarged microspores of tetrads in SM were observed, their frequencies were extremely low. Therefore, any size difference occurring in any of the four microspores in a tetrad in TMS and the enlarged microspores in SM were considered as positive responses.

Developmental pathways of cultured microspores have been reported to vary depending on the plant species and in response to various stress treatments and microspore developmental stages ( Sunderland  et al.  1979 ;  Raghavan 1986 ;  Kim  et al.  2004 ). There is a time window during microspore development in which microspores can be deviated effectively from their normal gametophytic programme for embryogenesis, representing a key for developing a protocol for microspore culture ( SeguÃ­-Simarro and Nuez 2005 ). The most common responsive stage is the uni-nucleate stage ( Heberle-Bors 1989 ) in monocot species such as coconut ( Cocos nucifera ) ( Perera  et al.  2008 ) and barley ( Hordeum vulgare ) ( Maraschin  et al.  2005 ) and dicot species such as pepper ( Capsicum annuum ) ( Kim  et al.  2008 ;  Lantos  et al.  2009 ); however, the early bi-nucleate stage may also be responsive. Calli originating from meiocytes have been reported in tomatoes ( Solanum lycopersicum ) ( Shtereva  et al.  1998 ;  SeguÃ­-Simarro and Nuez 2005 ). Here, we report the second case of the induction of microspore embryogenesis from microspores in the tetrad stage, providing the first detailed analysis of reprogramming occurring in isolated cassava microspores.   Perera  et al.  (2013)  correlated the size (diameter) of the gametophytes with the stages of male gametogenesis in SM 1219-9 and TMS 60444, and, based on this finding, flower buds were selected (ranging in diameter from 2.0 to 2.8 mm) containing developmental stages from tetrads via early, mid or late uni-nucleate stages to immature bi-nucleate and mature microspores. Since the microspores were separated into three size groups by filtering, each extract represented a range of developmental stages. In both SM and TMS, suspensions obtained by filtering with mesh sizes of 149â€“104 Âµm contained mainly late uni-nucleate microspores and more advanced stages (104 extract) while suspensions obtained with mesh sizes of 104â€“70 Âµm contained early to late uni-nucleate microspores and tetrads (70 extract), and suspensions obtained with mesh sizes of 70â€“41 Âµm contained early uni-nucleate microspores freed from the callose matrix of the tetrads (41 extract). Responsive microspores were present only in the 70-Âµm extract, consisting of microspores in the mid or late uni-nucleate stage and the tetrad stage. Furthermore, a genotypic effect was found, with microspores in the mid or late uni-nucleate stage being responsive only in the SM genotype, while tetrads were responsive in the TMS genotype.  The latter finding prompted us to study tetrad formation in more detail. After meiosis but still within the callose wall, cassava microspores passed through different stages with specific features. Initially, the microspores had a round shape and then became oval followed by further growth of the cell wall (plasma membrane and intine), which folded deeply into the cytoplasm. In addition, the nucleus in these tetrad microspores became smaller (Fig.Â  10 C). This seems to be a specific property of cassava meiosis. Exine synthesis started when the microspores were still enclosed by the callose wall (see FigsÂ  6 B,  10 B and C,  12 B and C) and continued after release from the callose wall as shown in Fig.Â  1 . On the other hand, enlarged microspores in cultured tetrads had a smooth surface without any exine particles attached to them. They may have originated from the round-shaped immature microspores with a smooth surface (as in Fig.Â  10 A). Fig.Â  2  shows that the non-enlarged microspores in the responsive tetrads are round shaped with a smooth surface, strongly suggesting that the first of the three stages of microspore development within the tetrads is the critical stage for reprogramming. Thus, it can be hypothesized that the reason for the low response in microspore cultures of the 70 extract is the low frequency of microspores in this critical stage. Another reason for the low microspore response is the low viability of the tetrad microspores. Viability may be lost during isolation and culturing. Yet, from the results presented, it is clear that microspore viability in tetrads is quite high at the time of bud collection and that there is no significant loss of viability during microspore culture. However, the study clearly demonstrated that the number of tetrads with non-viable microspores (one, two or three among the four microspores in tetrads) is about 45 % (Fig.Â  5 ). This observation sufficiently explains why only one or two microspores are responsive among the four in tetrads (Fig.Â  2 ). A further finding related to reprogramming was the lack of an exine on the responsive microspores. Thus, these microspores may be responsive only before the gametophytic programme has started. A possible link between the presence of exine particles and the viability of the microspores in the same tetrads was not analysed. Thus, both hypotheses may influence microspore reprogramming in the cultured tetrads of the TMS genotype. It is therefore necessary to continue the studies in order to find out whether there are any slight changes in the developmental pattern of the microspores in the same tetrads.  Enlargement of microspores is considered a marker for androgenesis induction in many crops ( Maraschin  et al.  2005 ).  Perera  et al.  (2014)  reported that microspore enlargement is the first sign of entering into androgenesis in cassava, whereas no size change was observed in some microspores in the cultured anthers of SM 1219-9. However, the exact reason for enlargement was not demonstrated there. The thick and auto-fluorescent exine of cassava microspores made it impossible to detect changes occurring within the microspores by light and fluorescent microscopy. Clorox that was used to remove the exine ( Wang  et al.  2011 ) did not do so completely; thus, exine auto-fluorescence still interfered with the fluorescence of DAPI staining. Here, we confirm in microspore cultures that enlargement is a marker for reprogramming. However, classical histology in this study gave clear evidence for cellular changes during reprogramming and for cell divisions occurring within microspores cultured at the mid or late uni-nucleate stage in genotype SM. This allowed us to follow the timing of nuclear divisions in the different pollen developmental pathways. Microspores at the late uni-nucleate stage, which are naturally scheduled to divide to form bi-cellular pollen grains by first pollen mitosis, could be induced by the pretreatment and the culture medium components to enter into the sporophytic pathway. At cell division, the nucleus moved to the centre and symmetric cell division occurred, demonstrating sporophytic development over asymmetric gametophytic development.  In TMS, we showed that responsive microspores in the tetrads were significantly different from their normal developmental pathway, with characteristic features such as vacuole formation and a light cytoplasm (as shown in Fig.Â  2 ) occurring at the time of enlargement. However, in some microspores containing dense cytoplasm, cell division occurred without any enlargement. Therefore, it seems that enlargement is a necessary component of reprogramming; however, some microspores enlarge further without being divided.  Apart from cassava, tomato is the only species in which androgenesis initiates both from the late uni-nucleate to early bi-nucleate stage and from the microspore mother cell to meiocyte stage.  SeguÃ­-Simarro and Nuez (2005)  compared the two stages and suggested that the cytoskeleton may play a role in the developmental switch at both stages, since processes such as the establishment of cell polarity and cytokinesis are common to both stages and are mediated by the cytoskeleton. In the present study on cassava, it was found that the competent stages differed in the two genotypes, being the immature tetrad stage in one genotype (TMS) and the mid to late uni-nucleate stage in the other (SM). Further in-depth studies at the ultra-cellular level are being performed at present in order to find out the reason for these differences and possible common cellular features in the two genotypes with respect to reprogramming toward sporophytic development. Enlargement also occurred in the meiocytes of TMS. Four-nucleated syncytium formed prior to tetrad cellularization was clearly observed from the histological micrographs of tetrads in cold pretreated tetrads (Fig.Â  10 D). Nuclear fusion may happen within these syncytial meiocytes and may develop into unreduced microspores as reported in cassava by  Perera  et al.  (2013) . Reprogramming in such unreduced microspores may give rise to MCSs and heterozygous diploid plants.  An important result of the present study was that the reprogramming occurred rapidly in both tetrads and microspores of TMS and SM. Microspore culture allowed us to detect the first changes towards sporophytic development within the first days of culture while in anther culture it took as long as 8 weeks to detect the first nuclear division in the microspores at the mid or late uni-nucleate stage ( Perera  et al.  2014 ). This clearly demonstrates the benefits of microspore culture. Multiple cell divisions occurred within 1 week in both genotypes forming MCSs. The current study clearly demonstrates that the thick microspore wall of cassava is no barrier for induction and further development of the MCS. When the microspore enlarges, and the sculptured particles of the exine move away from each other, creating spaces among the particles, this weakens the structure (as shown in Fig.Â  12 E). Cell division in the MCS creates further pressure on the microspore wall, and then the cells are pushed out through the aperture, as shown by SEM (Fig.Â  7 E and F), light microscopy (Fig.Â  11 F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig.Â  12 F). Given that the cassava microspore is multi-apertured, as shown in the SEM and histology micrographs, the pressure created by multiple cell divisions makes it easy to rupture the exine and release the MCS.  The NLN culture medium showed a negative response, indicating a specific induction effect of the NLNS medium ( Kim  et al.  2008 ). Brassica species efficiently give rise to microspore embryos in NLN or modified NLN media ( Swanson 1990 ). The NLNS medium found to be superior in this study was additionally supplemented with potassium iodide (0.83 mg L âˆ’1 ), which, therefore, may be an essential nutrient for cassava. Cell divisions in cultured cassava microspores occurred only after supplementing the NLNS medium with extra amounts of NaFeEDTA and CuSO 4 Â·5H 2 O. A suitable form of ion supplement in the induction medium was found to be essential for further development of induced microspore embryos in tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum ), barley and wheat ( Triticum  spp.) cultivars (genotypes), especially those providing few green plants via  in vitro  androgenesis ( NovotnÃ½  et al.  2000 ). NovotnÃ½  et al.  reported that, although Fe-EDTA was found to be a suitable form of ion in the induction medium, androgenesis was also induced on media containing non-chelated ion (Fe 2+  and Fe 3+  ions). Thus, the additional ion released from this complex may activate the cell division process in the induced or reprogrammed microspore in tetrads or the microspores. The presence of copper ions is reported to be effective in different ways in crops such as barley to increase green plant regeneration by decreasing starch production and increasing the quantity of internal membranes of plastids ( Jacquard  et al.  2009 ); however, the exact mode of action of these ions is still unclear.  In conclusion, the present study clearly demonstrated the feasibility of reprogramming of microspores for sporophytic development in the tetrads of TMS 60444 and the mid or late uni-nucleate microspores in SM 1219-9. NLNS medium supplemented with NaFeEDTA and CuSO 4 Â·5H 2 O turned out to be beneficial for cell division in both genotypes. The light and fluorescent microscopic and SEM and TEM studies generated evidence for external and internal structural changes during the process of reprogramming. As in other species, microspore enlargement was found to be a valuable marker for reprogramming but with limits. Furthermore, the critical stage in microspore tetrads was characterized in detail and related to microspore reprogramming. The reason was attributed to the low frequency of reprogramming, and the presence of non-responsive microspores among the responsive ones was found to be related to exine synthesis and the viability of the microspores in tetrads. The present study clearly demonstrated that reprogramming is much faster in microspore culture than in anther culture of cassava, which paves the way for the development of an efficient technique for the production of doubled haploids in cassava. This is the first detailed report of microspore reprogramming at the tetrad stage and the first report on microspore embryogenesis induction in isolated microspores of cassava with analytical evidence.
