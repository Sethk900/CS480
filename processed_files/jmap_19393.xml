Soil CO2 efflux from a mountainous forest-grassland ecosystem in central TaiwanDaytime soil CO2 efflux from a mountainous forest-grassland ecosystem in central Taiwan was measured approximately monthly from Oct. 2003 to Oct. 2004. The system featured two zones, each dominated by a different vegetation type, one a C-4 grass (Miscanthus transmorrisonensis) and the other a hemlock (Tsuga chinensis var. formosana). The relationship between the soil temperature and Soil CO2 efflux of these two zones was also investigated, and seasonal patterns in these two variables emerged. Soil temperature in the grassland zone ranged from 4 to 16 degrees C, and in the hemlock zone from 2 to 15 degrees C. The magnitude of the daytime soil CO2 efflux varied from 0.6 to 2.2 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and from 0.3 to 1.6 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for the grassland and forest zones, respectively. Within the same measuring period, the forest zone had significantly lower soil respiration than the grassland zone. Seasonal changes in the soil CO2 efflux of both zones correlated strongly with soil temperature. The average Q(10) values, the factor by which the respiration rate differs for a temperature interval of 10 degrees C, calculated from the exponential relation between soil CO2 efflux and soil temperature, were 3.5 and 2.8 for the forest and grassland zones, respectively. The result indicates that the soil CO2 efflux from the forest zone is more sensitive to changes in soil temperature than that from the grassland zone.
