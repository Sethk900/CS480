Data are lacking to estimate how many are hunted illegally each year. For this reason, we used abundance estimates derived from distance sampling surveys conducted in 1986&ndash;2014 to (1) fit a Bayesian state-space model, (2) estimate posterior distributions for population and harvest management parameters (e.g., growth rate, carrying capacity, and maximum sustainable harvest rate), and (3) predict abundance in 2025 as a function of potential illegal hunting in 2015&ndash;2024. For the Plain Pigeon and White-crowned Pigeon, respectively, the intrinsic rate of population growth was 0.351 (95&percnt; credible interval &equals; 0.086&ndash;0.737) and 0.352 (0.094&ndash;0.699), population carrying capacity was 55,840 (29,649&ndash;96,505) and 73,692 (47,225&ndash;98,434) individuals, maximum sustainable harvest rate was 0.176 (0.043&ndash;0.369 and 0.047&ndash;0.349), and predicted abundance was 20,536 (8,167&ndash;89,040) and 29,361 (1,779&ndash;100,937) individuals in 2025. Both pigeon populations increased from low numbers in the 1980&ndash;1990s, recovered quickly after hurricanes in 1989 and 1998, surpassed carrying capacity in 1995&ndash;2008, and decreased sharply at the same time that legal hunting of columbids increased in 2008&ndash;2014. Our monitoring and modeling results suggest that an increase in illegal hunting may be responsible for some of the abundance decline in 2008&ndash;2014, and that population sustainability may be affected by illegal hunting in 2015&ndash;2025. Therefore, data collection and the control of illegal hunting should be considered management priorities. Because we are updating model-based abundance predictions annually with monitoring data, we can inform management decisions, evaluate the results of conservation actions taken to maintain the pigeon populations fluctuating around carrying-capacity levels, and learn from the comparison of estimated and predicted abundances. Our monitoring and modeling scheme is applicable to other resident and migratory bird populations in the Caribbean.<italic>Patagioenas inornata wetmorei</italic> y <italic>P. leucocephala</italic> son cazadas ilegalmente, aunque est&aacute;n protegidas en Puerto Rico. No existen datos para estimar el n&uacute;mero de palomas que se cazan ilegalmente cada a&ntilde;o. Por esta raz&oacute;n, usamos estimados de abundancia de muestreos de distancia llevados a cabo en 1986&ndash;2014 para (1) ajustar un modelo Bayesiano de estado-espacio, (2) estimar las distribuciones posteriores de par&aacute;metros poblacionales y de manejo de cosecha (p.ej., tasa de crecimiento, capacidad de carga y tasa de cosecha m&aacute;xima sostenible), y (3) hacer predicciones sobre abundancia en 2025 como funci&oacute;n del potencial de caza ilegal en 2015&ndash;2024. Para el <italic>P. i. wetmorei</italic> y <italic>P. leucocephala</italic>, respectivamente, la tasa intr&iacute;nseca de crecimiento poblacional fue 0.351 (intervalo de credibilidad de 95&percnt; &equals; 0.086&ndash;0.737) y 0.352 (0.094&ndash;0.699), la capacidad de carga poblacional fue 55,840 (29,649&ndash;96,505) y 73,692 (47,255&ndash;98,434) individuos, la tasa de cosecha m&aacute;xima sostenible fue 0.176 (0.043&ndash;0.369 y 0.047&ndash;0.349), y la predicci&oacute;n de abundancia fue 20,536 (8,167&ndash;89,040) y 29,361 (1,778&ndash;100,937) individuos en 2025. Ambas poblaciones de palomas crecieron de n&uacute;meros bajos en 1980&ndash;1990s, se recuperaron r&aacute;pidamente de los huracanes en 1989 y 1998, sobrepasaron su capacidad de carga en 1995&ndash;2008, y decrecieron marcadamente al mismo tiempo que la actividad de caza legal de los col&uacute;mbidos aument&oacute; en 2008&ndash;2014. Nuestros resultados de monitoreo y modelaje sugieren que un aumento en la caza ilegal puede ser responsable de al menos parte del decrecimiento poblacional en 2008&ndash;2014, y que la sostenibilidad de las poblaciones puede verse afectada por la caza ilegal en 2015&ndash;2024. Por lo tanto, la recopilaci&oacute;n de datos y el control de la caza ilegal deben ser considerados prioridades de manejo. Porque nuestras predicciones de abundancia en base al modelo son actualizadas con datos de monitoreo anualmente, podemos informar las decisiones de manejo, evaluar las acciones de conservaci&oacute;n que se lleven a cabo para mantener a las poblaciones de palomas fluctuando alrededor de sus niveles de capacidad de carga, y aprender de la comparaci&oacute;n de los estimados y las predicciones de abundancia. Nuestro esquema de monitoreo y modelaje es aplicable a otras poblaciones de aves residentes y migratorias en el Caribe.<italic>Palabras clave:</italic> Evaluaci&oacute;n poblacional, modelo Bayesiano de estado-espacio, monitoreo, muestreo de distancia, <italic>Patagioenas inornata wetmorei</italic>, <italic>P. leucocephala</italic>Bird populations are often harvested for subsistence, commercial, recreational, or control purposes and are often managed with incomplete information about annual changes in abundance or knowledge of sustainable harvest levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Runge1">Runge et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Johnson1">Johnson et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Watts1">Watts et al. 2015</xref>).

Here, to address this concern, we provide an assessment of population sustainability given ongoing illegal hunting of the Puerto Rican Plain Pigeon (<italic>Patagioenas inornata wetmorei</italic>) and the White-crowned Pigeon (<italic>P. leucocephala</italic>). The Puerto Rican Plain Pigeon (&ldquo;Plain Pigeon&rdquo; hereafter) is a federally listed endangered subspecies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-U.S.FishandWildlifeService1">USFWS 1982</xref>), and the White-crowned Pigeon is listed as a bird of conservation concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-U.S.FishandWildlifeService3">USFWS 2008</xref>).The Plain Pigeon and White-crowned Pigeon are hunted illegally in Puerto Rico despite being protected by commonwealth and federal wildlife laws and regulations (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-U.S.DepartmentoftheInterior1">USDOI 2015</xref>). Presently, both pigeon populations are at low numbers, and data are lacking to determine whether mortality from illegal hunting can be sustained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Wiley1">Wiley 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Wiley2">1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-PuertoRicoDepartmentofNaturalandEnvironmentalResources1">PRDNER 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-U.S.FishandWildlifeService4">USFWS 2011</xref>). However, distance sampling surveys have been conducted annually to monitor changes in the abundance (density and population size) of game and nongame columbids in Puerto Rico since 1986 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-RiveraMilan1">Rivera-Mil&aacute;n 1995a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-RiveraMilan9">Rivera-Mil&aacute;n et al. 2003b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-RiveraMilan6">2014</xref>). Therefore, our objectives were to (1) fit a Bayesian state-space model using the abundance estimates derived from distance sampling surveys conducted in 1986&ndash;2014, (2) estimate posterior distributions for population and harvest management parameters (e.g., growth rate, carrying capacity, and maximum sustainable harvest rate), and (3) predict Plain Pigeon and White-crowned Pigeon abundance in 2025 as a function of potential illegal hunting in 2015&ndash;2024.Puerto Rico is the easternmost (18&deg;35&prime;&ndash;17&deg;55&prime;N, 67&deg;15&prime;&ndash;65&deg;35&prime;W) and smallest of the Greater Antilles.

There are 6 subtropical life zones, with the dry, moist, and wet zones covering 99&percnt; of the land area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Ewel1">Ewel and Whitmore 1973</xref>). Two major hurricanes made landfall and caused severe vegetation damage in 1989 and 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Boose1">Boose et al. 2004</xref>).

The survey region covered 749,000 ha, excluding urban centers and other heavily developed areas. On-road points were located systematically with random starts along paved and unpaved roads. Off-road points were located systematically with random starts at a minimum distance of 200 m from roads. Minimum distance was 400 m between off-road points and 800 m between on-road points. We used teams of 2 observers to increase the chance of meeting method assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Buckland1">Buckland et al. 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Buckland2">2008</xref>). Both observers remained side by side at point centers for 6 min, focusing on detecting calling and noncalling pigeons within 180 m. One observer focused on recording the data, while the other focused on recording detection distances to single pigeons or the geometric center of pigeon clusters. A cluster was defined as &ge;2 pigeons detected within 10 m of each other, showing similar behavior (e.g., perching on adjacent tree branches).Map of Puerto Rico, showing distance-sampling survey points used to estimate Plain Pigeon and White-crowned Pigeon abundance in April&ndash;June, 1986&ndash;2014.The 6-min count was intended to increase pigeon availability for detection and the chance of detecting calling pigeons visually for distance measurement to the nearest meter with rangefinders. When pigeons were heard but not seen, distances were measured to the nearest location, and the following distance categories were used: 0&ndash;15, 16&ndash;30, 31&ndash;45, 46&ndash;60, 61&ndash;90, 91&ndash;120, 121&ndash;180, 181&ndash;240, 241&ndash;340, 341&ndash;440 m. We analyzed the distance data using category midpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Buckland1">Buckland et al. 2001</xref>). We did not include flying pigeons in density estimates, unless initial locations were ascertained before movement. To minimize responsive movement, we did not implement a settling period before count initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Buckland2">Buckland et al. 2008</xref>). To increase pigeon availability for detection, repeated surveys were conducted from sunrise to midmorning and from midafternoon to sunset. The points were visited 1&ndash;3 times in April&ndash;June. Survey effort accounted for the number of visits per point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Buckland1">Buckland et al. 2001</xref>).We evaluated the fit of uniform, half-normal, and hazard-rate detection models with quantile&ndash;quantile plots and goodness-of-fit tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Burnham2">Burnham et al. 2004</xref>). The half-normal and hazard-rate key functions with and without series expansions were used to explore the influence of the following covariates: year (1998&ndash;2002, 2008&ndash;2011, 2014), month (April, May, June), life zone (dry, moist, wet), detection mode (heard only, heard&ndash;seen), detection time (0&ndash;3 min, 4&ndash;6 min), time of day (minutes after sunrise, minutes before sunset), disturbance level from traffic and background noise (none&ndash;low, medium&ndash;high), vertical and horizontal vegetation cover within 60 m (0&ndash;50&percnt; &lsqb;none&ndash;low&rsqb;, 51&ndash;100&percnt; &lsqb;medium&ndash;high&rsqb;), point location (on road, off road), species (Plain Pigeon, White-crowned Pigeon), observer team (8 teams), and cluster size (as defined above). We used nonparametric bootstrapping to estimate density variation, and based model selection on minimization of Akaike's Information Criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Buckland1">Buckland et al. 2001</xref>).We estimated Plain Pigeon and White-crowned Pigeon detection and density independently each year in 1986&ndash;2014. Off-road points were not surveyed in 1993&ndash;1996, 2003&ndash;2007, 2012, and 2013; and covariate information was incomplete or not collected before 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-RiveraMilan1">Rivera-Mil&aacute;n 1995a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-RiveraMilan9">Rivera-Mil&aacute;n et al. 2003b</xref>). For this reason, we used multiple-covariate distance sampling for the analysis of covariate information collected at points along roads (<italic>k</italic> &equals; 725&ndash;1,025) and away from roads (<italic>k</italic> &equals; 300&ndash;350) in 1998&ndash;2002, 2008&ndash;2011, and 2014.

Distance sampling results are presented as means &plusmn; bootstrap SE.We used a Bayesian framework to estimate the unobserved parameters and unknown population states, assuming conditional independence for each time step. We first specified uniform prior distributions with wide bounds for population growth rate (<italic>r</italic> ~ Uniform &lsqb;0.010, 0.200&rsqb;), carrying capacity (<italic>K</italic> ~ Uniform &lsqb;1,000, 100,000&rsqb;), and the mean of the initial population proportion on the log scale (<italic>P</italic><sub>0</sub> ~ Uniform &lsqb;&minus;10, 0&rsqb;). For the process error and initial population proportion standard deviations, we also specified uniform priors (&sigma;<sub>process</sub> and <inline-formula id="i0010-5422-118-2-300-ilm03"><inline-graphic xlink:href="i0010-5422-118-2-300-ilm03.gif" mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple"></inline-graphic></inline-formula> ~ Uniform &lsqb;0, 10&rsqb;; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Gelman2">Gelman and Hill 2007</xref>).

We conducted 250,000 iterations and used the first 50,000 iterations as a burn-in period. We generated 3 Markov chains with different initial parameter values, and used trace plots and node summary statistics to check for MCMC algorithm convergence (e.g., Brooks-Gelman-Rubin diagnostic statistic <italic>R̂</italic> &equals; 1.00; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Gelman1">Gelman et al. 2004</xref>). Before summarizing the posterior, we thinned the Markov chains by 25 to obtain samples of 8,000 points. For model-based abundance predictions (<italic>N</italic><sub>2025</sub>), we assumed uniform illegal harvest rates (<italic>h</italic> ~ Uniform &lsqb;0.01, 0.25&rsqb;). We defined population sustainability in terms of the probability that predicted abundance in 2025 would exceed carrying capacity, given potential illegal harvest rates in 2015&ndash;2024 (i.e. Pr&lsqb;<italic>N</italic><sub>2025</sub> &gt; <italic>K</italic><sub>1986&ndash;2014</sub>&thinsp;&verbar;&thinsp;<italic>h</italic><sub>2015&ndash;2024</sub>&rsqb;).

However, both pigeon populations fluctuated widely over time, and Bayesian estimates of parameters were uncertain, as reflected by the standard deviations and credible intervals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-t01">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-f03">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-f04">4</xref>).

Through annual comparisons of distance-sampling abundance estimates and model-based abundance predictions, we can inform management decisions and evaluate the results of conservation actions that aim to maintain the pigeon populations fluctuating around carrying capacity levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-U.S.FishandWildlifeService2">USFWS 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-U.S.FishandWildlifeService4">2011</xref>). Our monitoring and modeling efforts can also lead to a better understanding of the negative impacts of illegal hunting and other factors that influence population dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-RiveraMilan3">Rivera-Mil&aacute;n 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-RiveraMilan4">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-RiveraMilan8">Rivera-Mil&aacute;n et al. 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-RiveraMilan6">2014</xref>).The reliability of our monitoring data depends largely on meeting method assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Buckland1">Buckland et al. 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Buckland2">2008</xref>). Teams of 2 observers did not likely miss pigeons at point centers during 6-min counts. In most instances, calling pigeons were detected visually and distances were measured with little error, as evidenced by quantile&ndash;quantile plots and goodness-of-fit tests (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Burnham2">Burnham et al. 2004</xref>: figure 11.9). We did not include moving pigeons in density estimates unless distances were measured to initial locations, before responsive movements, which tended to be away from the observers and with loud wing-flapping sounds. Cluster size tended to be small and had a negligible effect on detection and density estimation. None of the covariates examined caused extreme heterogeneity in the detection function (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Marques2">Marques et al. 2007</xref>: figure 5.7).Moreover, the uniform and hazard-rate detection models generated similar density estimates, which suggests that model selection was of secondary importance for abundance inferences in the survey region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Buckland1">Buckland et al. 2001</xref>). The survey scheme was extensive and provided representative coverage of pigeon abundance in the 3 major life zones of the island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-RiveraMilan1">Rivera-Mil&aacute;n 1995a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-RiveraMilan9">Rivera-Mil&aacute;n et al. 2003b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-RiveraMilan6">2014</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that the assumptions of distance sampling were met, and that relatively unbiased abundance estimates were obtained for monitoring and modeling the dynamics of the Plain Pigeon and White-crowned Pigeon populations in Puerto Rico.The model was useful for describing Plain Pigeon and White-crowned Pigeon population dynamics, estimating the posterior distributions of population and harvest management parameters, and predicting changes in abundance resulting from potential illegal hunting. The posterior estimates of population growth rate and carrying capacity seem biologically reasonable, despite high uncertainty. For example, on the basis of life-history characteristics and nest-monitoring data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-RiveraMilan3">Rivera-Mil&aacute;n 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-RiveraMilan4">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-RiveraMilan8">Rivera-Mil&aacute;n et al. 2003a</xref>), and using equation 18 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Johnson1">Johnson et al. (2012)</xref>, we obtained a population growth rate of 0.35, assuming that annual fecundity rate was 1.50 young breeding pair<sup>&minus;1</sup>, and that annual survival rate was 0.50 for juveniles and 0.60 for adults. Fecundity rates can be higher as a result of extended nesting (&ge;6 mo), multiple brooding (&ge;3 clutches), first-year reproduction, and diverse frugivorous diets. Ideally, we would like to develop more detailed models associated with hypotheses about how population growth rate and carrying capacity change in relation to foraging and nesting resources, but demographic and habitat data are lacking to represent this additional complexity.We made a series of simplifying assumptions to model the dynamics of the pigeon populations (e.g., linear density dependence, negligible immigration and emigration, and additive hunting mortality). However, restricting the model to essential parameters was pragmatic and sufficed for description, estimation, and prediction, while explicitly accounting for variation associated with process and observation errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Meyer1">Meyer and Millar 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Millar1">Millar and Meyer 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Kery1">K&eacute;ry and Schaub 2012</xref>). Posterior distributions and abundance predictions were imprecise because variation from process and observation errors were included in the model. Pigeons can offset low survival rates through high fecundity rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-RiveraMilan2">Rivera-Mil&aacute;n 1995b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-RiveraMilan3">1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-RiveraMilan4">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-RiveraMilan8">Rivera-Mil&aacute;n et al. 2003a</xref>), and this, in turn, can cause wide population fluctuations and high variation from process error (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Kery1">K&eacute;ry and Schaub 2012</xref>: figure 5.7).We monitored the pigeon populations during a period of natural reforestation in abandoned agricultural areas in the 1980s&ndash;1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Brandeis1">Brandeis et al. 2007</xref>). This period also included 2 major hurricanes in 1989 and 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Boose1">Boose et al. 2004</xref>) and an increase in legal hunting of columbids in 2008&ndash;2014 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-RiveraMilan6">Rivera-Mil&aacute;n et al. 2014</xref>). The Plain Pigeon and White-crowned Pigeon populations increased from low numbers and surpassed carrying capacity in 1995&ndash;2008, probably as a result of an increase in foraging and nesting resources in second-growth forests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-RiveraMilan3">Rivera-Mil&aacute;n 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-RiveraMilan4">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-RiveraMilan8">Rivera-Mil&aacute;n et al. 2003a</xref>). Population recovery was quick after hurricanes, but abundance decreased sharply at the same time that legal hunting activity increased on the island. Although habitat loss due to urban development and other conservation threats cannot be ruled out, our monitoring and modeling results suggest that an increase in illegal hunting might be responsible for some of the abundance decline in 2008&minus;2014, and that population sustainability might be affected by illegal hunting in 2015&minus;2025. Therefore, data collection and the control of illegal hunting should be considered management priorities. Illegal hunting data can be collected through randomized mail questionnaires and more intensive telephone and personal interviews with hunters and the general public living near hunting areas (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Levy1">Levy and Lemeshow 1999</xref>). Illegal hunting activity can be partially controlled through hunter education efforts and by increasing surveillance activity and the number of areas closed to hunting on the island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-U.S.FishandWildlifeService1">USFWS 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-U.S.DepartmentoftheInterior1">USDOI 2015</xref>).Because model-based abundance predictions are updated with monitoring data annually, we can continue learning from the comparison of estimated and predicted abundances, despite partial control of illegal hunting, imperfect observation of population state, incomplete understanding of population dynamics, and environmental variability due to weather conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Williams1">Williams et al. 2002</xref>). Finally, although we have focused here on the sustainability of Plain Pigeon and White-crowned Pigeon populations given potential illegal hunting in Puerto Rico, our monitoring and modeling scheme is applicable to population assessments of other resident and migratory birds in the Caribbean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-RiveraMilan7">Rivera-Mil&aacute;n et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-RiveraMilan5">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-118-2-300-Watts1">Watts et al. 2015</xref>).Assistance with fieldwork was provided by wildlife biologists from projects W-11, W-16, and W-21, including D.
