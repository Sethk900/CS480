Estimating relative ages from iron-oxide/total-iron ratios of soils in the western Po Valley, ItalyNineteen samples were collected from deeper layers of as many terraces forming agesequences in five basins. Most samples were collected at depths of 1 m or more, with some below 3 m. Soils at the sample sites were tentatively identified as Alfisols, Entisols or Inceptisols. Total amounts of iron and the amounts extractable by dithionite and by oxalate were determined for the 19 samples. Redness ratings were calculated from sample colors and related to amounts of extractable iron by regression. Mineralogies of the fine sand, silt and clay fractions were also determined. The percentage of the total iron (Fet) extracted by dithionite (Fed) minus the amount extracted by oxalate (Feo) increased gradually with ages of the terraces, which range from early Middle Pleistocene to Upper Pleistocene-Holocene. These percentages are independent of the total amounts of iron in the samples and of the general lithology of a basin. Such ratios thus promise to be useful in estimating relative ages, especially where time-sequences exist. Mineralogies of the samples were consistent with relative ages of terraces as estimated from the ratios of iron in different forms. So were the redness ratings. The regression of extracted iron on redness ratings suggests that colors can be used as preliminary field indicators of relative ages of terraces without time-sequences.
