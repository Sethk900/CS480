Delta Smelt to evaluate sensitivity to climate change stressors. Thermal tolerance decreased among successive stages, and juvenile tolerance limits were closest to current environmental conditions. Salinity impacted juvenile and adult survival in exposures over acute timescales.Coastal ecosystems are among the most human-impacted habitats globally, and their management is often critically linked to recovery of declining native species. In the San Francisco Estuary, the Delta Smelt (<italic>Hypomesus transpacificus</italic>) is an endemic, endangered fish strongly tied to Californian conservation planning. The complex life history of Delta Smelt combined with dynamic seasonal and spatial abiotic conditions result in dissimilar environments experienced among ontogenetic stages, which may yield stage-specific susceptibility to abiotic stressors. Climate change is forecasted to increase San Francisco Estuary water temperature and salinity; therefore, understanding the influences of ontogeny and phenotypic plasticity on tolerance to these critical environmental parameters is particularly important for Delta Smelt and other San Francisco Estuary fishes. We assessed thermal and salinity limits in several ontogenetic stages and acclimation states of Delta Smelt, and paired these data with environmental data to evaluate sensitivity to climate-change stressors. Thermal tolerance decreased among successive stages, with larval fish exhibiting the highest tolerance and post-spawning adults having the lowest. Delta Smelt had limited capacity to increase tolerance through thermal acclimation, and comparisons with field temperature data revealed that juvenile tolerance limits are the closest to current environmental conditions, which may make this stage especially susceptible to future climate warming. Maximal water temperatures observed <italic>in situ</italic> exceeded tolerance limits of juveniles and adults. Although these temperature events are currently rare, if they increase in frequency as predicted, it could result in habitat loss at these locations despite other favourable conditions for Delta Smelt. In contrast, Delta Smelt tolerated salinities spanning the range of expected environmental conditions for each ontogenetic stage, but salinity did impact survival in juvenile and adult stages in exposures over acute time scales. Our results underscore the importance of considering ontogeny and phenotypic plasticity in assessing the impacts of climate change, particularly for species adapted to spatially and temporally heterogeneous environments.Coastal ecosystems are among the most human-impacted habitats globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C46">Lotze <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), and climate change is predicted to interact with existing stressors to generate effects spanning multiple physical and biological scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C36">Harley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C20">Crain <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The San Francisco Estuary (SFE) is one of the largest and most economically valuable estuarine systems in North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C60">Service, 2007</xref>), and anthropogenic use of the SFE has resulted in it being one of the most modified and controlled systems in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C54">Nichols <italic>et al.</italic>, 1986</xref>). Landscape-scale modifications have reduced habitat complexity and led to major declines of once numerous native species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C61">Sommer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C52">Moyle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), exemplified by precipitous declines of multiple pelagic fish populations since the early 2000s (referred to as the pelagic organism decline; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C27">Feyrer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C61">Sommer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). One of the species affected by the pelagic organism decline is the Delta Smelt (<italic>Hypomesus transpacificus</italic>), a fish endemic to the SFE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C6">Bennett, 2005</xref>).Like many other species inhabiting human-altered ecosystems, the decline of Delta Smelt has been associated with numerous stressors, such as habitat loss, entrainment at water pumping stations (i.e. fish drawn through intakes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C14">Castillo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), competition and predation from non-native species, food limitation due to changes in the plankton community, altered abiotic conditions and contaminants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C61">Sommer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C67">Winder and Jassby, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C12">Brooks <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C17">Cloern and Jassby, 2012</xref>). Listed under both the Federal Endangered Species Act and California Endangered Species Act and an indicator of SFE ecological health, recovery of Delta Smelt is a critical component of statewide management efforts to balance ecosystem restoration with ecosystem services. Specifically, resource managers are tasked with providing a reliable water supply for farmlands and over 23â€…million Californians, as well as the maintenance of healthy wildlife populations and ecosystem function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C55">NRC, 2012</xref>). Determining the best management actions to accomplish these sometimes conflicting objectives has been politically and publically debated in California for over a decade, making the scientific understanding of stressor impacts on Delta Smelt important not only to effective conservation, but also to statewide environmental policies.The SFE is subject to strong tidal influences from the Pacific Ocean mixing with fluctuating freshwater input from the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C17">Cloern and Jassby, 2012</xref>), producing a dynamic system with spatial and seasonal gradients in water parameters (e.g. temperature, salinity). These variations in abiotic conditions may influence behavioural responses and affect physiological processes across multiple levels of biological organization in fishes such as Delta Smelt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C34">Fry, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C39">Hochachka and Somero, 2002</xref>). Temperature is a key determinant of fish survival and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C11">Brett, 1971</xref>), resulting in fishes being generally adapted to the water temperatures that they routinely experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C26">Fangue <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C24">Eliason <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Likewise, salinity is a critical abiotic condition for fishes, and tolerance is largely dependent on physiological responses to maintain ionic and osmotic balance (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C25">Evans, 2008</xref>). Coping with temperature and salinity stress can be associated with a high energetic cost, such that optimal performance often occurs over a relatively narrow range for each parameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C59">Schulte <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C37">Hasenbein <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Yet temperature and salinity tolerance limits are governed by the complex interplay of mechanisms of adaptation and phenotypic plasticity, such as acclimatization, i.e. reversible biochemical changes due to environmental exposure that can alter tolerance within individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C59">Schulte <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Individuals may be able to employ phenotypic plasticity to cope with thermal or salinity stress within a range of conditions; however, beyond a certain threshold, evolutionary adaptation via natural selection is necessary to avoid extirpation or, in the case of endemic fishes such as Delta Smelt with extremely limited options for range expansion, extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C41">Hofmann and Todgham, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C48">McBryan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).Map of the San Francisco Estuary depicting estimated habitat regions for different ontogenetic stages of Delta Smelt, where abiotic conditions, including salinity and temperature, fluctuate spatially and temporally.Understanding the influences of ontogeny and acclimatization responses on the temperature and salinity tolerance of the Delta Smelt is particularly important because forecasted impacts of climate change in SFE include increases in the mean and variability of these environmental parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C15">Cayan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C18">Cloern <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). These climatic effects will be likely to augment the impacts of anthropogenic water diversion, which has already reduced the amount of freshwater inflow into the SFE by âˆ¼40% on average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C47">Lund <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), resulting in higher salinities upstream during the autumn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C17">Cloern and Jassby, 2012</xref>) and increased summer water temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C52">Moyle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). As these changes occur, the ability of Delta Smelt and other SFE fishes to maintain fitness in their native habitats will depend on their tolerance limits, phenotypic plasticity, adaptive capacity and related biotic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C38">Helmuth, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C41">Hofmann and Todgham, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, as a largely annual species, Delta Smelt recruitment is almost exclusively dependent on the fitness of the cohort in the previous year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C6">Bennett, 2005</xref>); combined with their limited range, this may make Delta Smelt susceptible to declines due to poor environmental conditions in a single year.As management plans are designed and implemented in the SFE to protect and restore wildlife in the face of climate change (e.g. on-going planning of large-scale tidal marsh restoration by the US Fish and Wildlife Service), understanding the physiological responses of organisms is paramount to effective conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C66">Wikelski and Cooke, 2006</xref>). Previous studies of the thermal and salinity tolerance of Delta Smelt reported physiological limits for adults at one acclimation temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C64">Swanson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), which are currently used for climate-change impact assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C18">Cloern <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C13">Brown <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>) across the entire SFE and specific management regulations, such as restriction of water diversion flows to protect larval and juvenile Delta Smelt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C65">USFWS, 2008</xref>). In this study, we assess thermal and salinity tolerance across ontogenetic stages and acclimation conditions to investigate the phenotypic plasticity in Delta Smelt responses to these climate-change stressors. We then employ several tolerance indices to evaluate the â€˜bufferâ€™ between Delta Smelt physiological limits and current habitat conditions to demonstrate differential sensitivity to climate warming among ontogenetic stages in this endangered species. Our study underscores the importance of assessing differences across life-cycles to climate change projections, particularly for species adapted to spatially and temporally heterogeneous environments.Fish were spawned between February and April in 2012 or 2013 and reared in optimal culture conditions (15.4â€“16.7Â°C) determined for Delta Smelt at the UC Davis Fish Conservation and Culture Laboratory (FCCL; Byron, CA, USA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C2">Baskerville-Bridges <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C45">Lindberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). The Delta Smelt refuge population breeding programme at FCCL incorporates a unique genetic management strategy that includes a variety of methods to minimize inbreeding, maintain genetic representation from the wild founding population and maximize genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C31">Fisch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C32">2013</xref>). We conducted experiments for five ontogenetic stages defined by days post hatch (dph), as follows: larval (30â€“32â€…dph), late-larval (60â€“64â€…dph), juvenile (140â€“164â€…dph), adult (200â€“250â€…dph) and post-spawning adults (&gt;300â€…dph). We performed larval and late-larval fish experiments at FCCL, where fish were held under a natural photoperiod and fed live prey from cultures of rotifers (<italic>Brachionus plicatus</italic>) and brine shrimp nauplii (<italic>Artemia franciscana</italic>); <italic>Nannochloropsis</italic> (Reed Mariculture, Campbell, CA, USA) was used to increase water turbidity to promote feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C1">Baskerville-Bridges <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). We conducted experiments for post-larval stages (juveniles, adults and post-spawning adults) at the UC Davis Putah Creek aquaculture facility. Post-larval fish were fed an <italic>ad libitum</italic> 2:1 mixture of Inve-NRD commercial feed (Inve Aquaculture, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) and Hikari plankton (Pentair Aquatic Ecosystems, Apopka, FL, USA) throughout the day via automatic feeders under a natural photoperiod. Water quality was monitored daily with a YSIâ€…556 water quality instrument (YSI Incorporated, Yellow Springs, OH, USA) for pH (8.6â€…Â±â€…0.38) and dissolved oxygen (100â€“105% saturation). We used biological filtration, via a custom wetâ€“dry filter that trickled water over Bio-Balls in an oxygen-rich chamber, with flushing to remove nitrogenous waste, and monitored ammonia and nitrite daily using a colorimetric test kit (API, Calfont, PA, USA). All handling, care and experimental procedures used were reviewed and approved by the UC Davis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC Protocol # 16591).We quantified upper thermal acclimation limits using chronic thermal tolerance methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C9">Bennett <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). We conducted chronic lethal thermal maximum (CLT<sub>max</sub>) experiments only for post-larval stages (i.e. juveniles, adults and post-spawning adults) because larval fish require low light, black containers, minimal disturbance and elevated turbidities for feeding, and these rearing conditions inhibit accurate mortality estimations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C2">Baskerville-Bridges <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). For each stage, we defined CLT<sub>max</sub> as the highest temperature at which 50% (CLT<sub>max50</sub>) and 95% (CLT<sub>max95</sub>) morbidity was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C30">Fields <italic>et al.</italic>, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C8">Bennett and Beitinger, 1997</xref>). Fish remained in three 340â€…l holding tanks after 3â€…week acclimation periods (at 18.7â€…Â±â€…0.2Â°C) while we increased temperature by 1Â°C/day until 100% mortality. We recorded temperature twice daily using a YSIâ€…556 water quality instrument (YSI Incorporated) calibrated to a laboratory standard thermometer and hourly via iBCod temperature loggers (Alpha Mach, Inc., Ste-Julie, QC, Canada) submerged in each experimental tank.We determined upper temperature tolerance in Delta Smelt using critical thermal methodology (CTM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C5">Beitinger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), specifically quantifying critical thermal maximum (CT<sub>max</sub>), defined as the upper temperature at which fish lose the ability to escape conditions that will ultimately lead to death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C19">Cox, 1974</xref>). Larval and late-larval fish only were held at optimal culture temperatures of 16.4â€…Â±â€…0.25Â°C at FCCL, and we split post-larval fish held at the UC Davis Putah Creek facility into the following three acclimation groups: low (12.0â€“12.5Â°C); medium (15.5â€“16.5Â°C); and high (18.5â€“19.5Â°C; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/conphys/cou008/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Table S1</ext-link>). We brought fish to each of the acclimation conditions by increasing or decreasing temperature by 1Â°C/day, and subsequently held fish at the final acclimation temperatures for at least 3â€…weeks prior to CT<sub>max</sub> experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C5">Beitinger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). For each CT<sub>max</sub> trial, we placed a randomly selected fish in a 2â€…l black chamber filled with water at the respective acclimation temperature and covered with black mesh. We placed chambers in a 115â€…l water bath at acclimation temperature, and each chamber was fitted with an airstone to maintain dissolved oxygen at 100â€“105% saturation, a temperature logger and a glass thermometer calibrated to a laboratory standard thermometer. We fitted the water baths with titanium heaters, temperature controllers (Finnex Schuber Wright, Chicago, IL, USA) and Danner MD3 pumps (Pentair Aquatic Ecosystems, Apopka, FL, USA) to ensure even heating and circulation. Once in the chamber, each fish was given a 30â€“45â€…min habituation period prior to the start of the temperature increase. We used a thermal increase of 0.3Â°C/min for CT<sub>max</sub> trials so that fish core temperatures would closely track changes in water temperature without allowing time for fish to acclimate thermally during the experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C4">Becker and Genoway, 1979</xref>). We recorded temperatures and monitored fish for activity every 5â€…min until any abnormal behaviour was observed, after which we monitored fish continuously. We employed loss of equilibrium (LOE) as the end-point determining CT<sub>max</sub>, signifying â€˜ecological deathâ€™ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C19">Cox, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C4">Becker and Genoway, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C5">Beitinger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Once LOE was reached, we recorded the temperature and immediately returned fish to adjacent chambers containing water at the fish's original acclimation temperature and allowed them to recover. Recovered fish were weighed (wet massâ€…Â±â€…0.1â€…g) and measured (fork lengthâ€…Â±â€…0.5â€…mm) to assess covariation of fish size and treatments (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/conphys/cou008/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Table S1</ext-link>), and returned to separate holding tanks to ensure they would not be selected for subsequent CT<sub>max</sub> trials. We calculated CT<sub>max</sub> as the arithmetic mean of the LOE temperatures for each stage and acclimation group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C19">Cox, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C5">Beitinger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>).We quantified upper salinity acclimation limits using chronic salinity tolerance methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C64">Swanson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Chronic lethal salinity maximum (CLS<sub>max</sub>) exposures were conducted for juvenile and adult Delta Smelt because chronic salinity exposure is environmentally relevant for these ontogenetic stages, and culture requirements for larval fish precluded their inclusion in CLS<sub>max</sub> experiments (larval fish require turbidity for feeding that visually impedes accurate quantification of mortality over the time scales required for CLS<sub>max</sub> experiments). Fish remained in three 340â€…l holding tanks after acclimation periods while we increased salinity by 2.0â€…ppt/12â€…h via the addition of artificial sea salt (Instant Ocean; Spectrum Brands, Inc., Blacksburg, VA, USA) into the sump of the recirculating system. We checked tanks for mortalities and recorded salinities every 12â€…h prior to the next salinity increase. We recorded salinities with a YSI 556 instrument, calibrated with 10â€…000â€…Î¼S/cm National Institute of Standards and Technology traceable conductivity standard (YSI Incorporated). We increased salinity to 100% mortality or until seawater conditions were reached (34.0â€…ppt). If the latter conditions occurred, we held fish at 34.0â€…ppt for 3â€…weeks to monitor daily survival and assess salinity-related delayed mortality.We determined upper salinity tolerance in Delta Smelt by conducting acute salinity maximum (AS<sub>max</sub>) exposures. The experimental design differed between larval and post-larval stages due to culture requirements and the environmental relevance of salinity end-points between stages. We used preliminary range-finding salinity experiments to determine treatment levels for juvenile and adult fish, and chose treatment levels for late-larval fish <italic>a priori</italic>, including three environmentally relevant salinities (0.4, 2.0 and 6.0â€…ppt) and two higher levels that late-larval fish may experience in rare conditions (12.0 and 18.0â€…ppt). For late-larval fish, we placed 15 individuals in each 9.5â€…l black container filled with holding tank water and fitted with airstones, mesh-covered drains and water lines to create flow-through conditions. Following an overnight acclimation period, we ramped vessels over 6â€…h to targeted salinities via water delivered from head tanks using peristaltic pumps. Head tanks contained holding tank water brought to target salinities using Instant Ocean, and we conducted four replicates for each of the five target salinities. We checked and removed mortalities and recorded water quality hourly during the ramping phase, followed by monitoring at each designated time point (0â€“6, 12, 24, 30 and 48â€…h). After 48â€…h, we removed containers individually, euthanized and counted fish to confirm survival. We conducted juvenile and adult AS<sub>max</sub> experiments by allowing fish to remain in recirculating tanks while Instant Ocean was added to sumps over a 6â€…h ramp to targeted salinities. Three salinities were chosen [2.3 (control), 18.5 and 34.0â€…ppt] based on chronic salinity experiment results, preliminary acute experiments demonstrating these stages to be resistant to lower salinities (L.â€…M.â€…Komoroske, unpublished data), and because these ontogenetic stages are more likely to experience higher salinities <italic>in situ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C6">Bennett, 2005</xref>). We monitored tanks hourly for mortalities and water quality parameters during the ramping phase, at each designated time point (0â€“6, 12, 24 and 48â€…h) and daily up to 3â€…weeks. At the termination of the adult AS<sub>max</sub> experiment, fish were randomly selected from each of the three salinity treatments for CT<sub>max</sub> trials to assess differences in thermal tolerance due to sublethal salinity stress.We performed all statistical analyses using R (version 2.15.2; R-CoreTeam, 2012) and associated packages â€˜lme4â€™, â€˜carâ€™ and â€˜multcompâ€™ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C42">Hothorn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). We analysed data using linear models (LMs) via the R core package (R-CoreTeam, 2012) and generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) using â€˜lme4â€™ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C3">Bates <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). We generated model summary tables using â€˜carâ€™ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C33">Fox and Weisberg, 2011</xref>) and conducted multiple comparisons for both LMs and GLMMs between treatment levels of fixed effects using â€˜multcompâ€™ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C42">Hothorn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). For CLT<sub>max</sub> analysis, we employed GLMMs with a binomial error distribution and logit link function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C3">Bates <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) to determine differences in CLT<sub>max</sub> among stages, including a random individual fish effect to account for repeated observations. We evaluated overdispersion by estimating the ratio of residual deviance to residual degrees of freedom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C23">Dobson, 2002</xref>). To generate model estimates and confidence intervals for the fixed effects, we sampled from a naÃ¯ve posterior distribution (60â€…000 times) for each stage of chronic temperatures at which 50% (CLT<sub>max50</sub>) and 95% (CLT<sub>max95</sub>) mortality would occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C49">McElreath, 2013</xref>). For CT<sub>max</sub> analysis, we conducted two separate LMs because larval and late-larval fish were available at only one acclimation temperature. We applied the first LM to all ontogenetic stages at the medium acclimation temperature only, using ontogenetic stage as a single predictor of LOE. The second LM for post-larval fish employed ontogenetic stage (juvenile, adult and post-spawning adult), acclimation temperature and their interaction as predictors of LOE (R-CoreTeam, 2012). Fish size within each ontogenetic stage did not significantly affect CT<sub>max</sub> for any acclimation group and was therefore not included in the final LMs as a covariate. We evaluated data assumptions and LM fit graphically, i.e. residual vs. fitted values, residual vs. predictor values and residual histograms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C68">Zuur <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).We assessed effects of salinity and exposure duration for AS<sub>max</sub> with the same approach described for CLT<sub>max</sub>, using separate logit link GLMMs for: (i)â€…the late-larval stage and (ii)â€…juveniles and adults. We also followed the juvenileâ€“adult model with a GLMM to evaluate differences between ontogenetic stage and salinity specifically after 96â€…h of exposure (logit link function, including random effect of tank). Finally, we evaluated the effect of salinity on CT<sub>max</sub> in adult fish following AS<sub>max</sub> exposures using an LM with salinity as a single predictor of LOE. Pairwise comparisons were performed for all analyses using the glht() function in the â€˜multcompâ€™ package, with an adjusted Î±â€…=â€…0.05.Model results for Delta Smelt thermal toleranceThe CT<sub>max</sub> analyses used linear models (Gaussian error distributions), and CLT analysis employed a generalized linear mixed model (binomial error distribution).

PS-Adult denotes post-spawning Delta Smelt.Acute thermal tolerance of Delta Smelt (CT<sub>max</sub>) across all stages examined at the medium acclimation temperature was highest in larval fish (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU008F2">2</xref>b, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COU008TB1">1</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/conphys/cou008/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Table S2</ext-link>). The CT<sub>max</sub> decreased with each subsequent ontogenetic stage (adjusted <italic>P</italic>â€…â‰¤â€…0.05), with the exceptions of between adults and juveniles (adjusted <italic>P</italic>â€…=â€…0.95) and between adults and late-larval fish (adjusted <italic>P</italic>â€…=â€…0.087).For post-larval stages of Delta Smelt, acclimation temperature, ontogenetic stage and their interaction were significant factors influencing CT<sub>max</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU008F2">2</xref>b, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COU008TB1">1</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/conphys/cou008/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Table S2</ext-link>). Within each stage, CT<sub>max</sub> for the lowest acclimation group was significantly reduced relative to both medium and high acclimation temperature groups (adjusted <italic>P</italic>â€…â‰¤â€…0.03; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU008F2">2</xref>b and Tables S2 and S3). However, the CT<sub>max</sub> values of medium and high acclimation temperature groups did not differ from each other (adjusted <italic>P</italic>â€…â‰¥â€…0.24), indicating that effects of acclimation on thermal tolerance are minimal at higher temperatures in Delta Smelt.Warming tolerance estimates for each stage of Delta Smelt, defined as <inline-formula><tex-math notation="TeX">$\overline{\hbox{CT}_{{\rm max}}}{}_{\rm (medium acclimation temperature)}$</tex-math></inline-formula>â€…âˆ’â€…<italic>T</italic><sub>habitat (metrics of habitat temperatures)</sub>Habitat temperature profiles for each ontogenetic stage of Delta Smelt examined and the corresponding thermal tolerances determined in this study.

Late-larval data are not shown because they did not exhibit any significant difference in survival across salinity treatments.Understanding how organisms will respond to climate change is critical if conservation and management strategies are to be successful in the long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C38">Helmuth, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C40">Hoffmann and Sgro, 2011</xref>). The physiological capacity of organisms to cope with predicted alterations in abiotic conditions is a critical component of their responses to climate change, and can be heavily influenced by phenotypic plasticity and life history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C62">Stillman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C66">Wikelski and Cooke, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C57">PÃ¶rtner and Farrell, 2008</xref>). The thermal tolerance of Delta Smelt generally decreased among successive ontogenetic stages, and they had limited capacity to increase tolerance via thermal acclimation. Juvenile Delta Smelt exhibited the lowest WT, and rare maximal temperatures <italic>in situ</italic> have already been observed that exceed tolerance limits of juvenile and adult Delta Smelt. In contrast, the salinity tolerance of Delta Smelt spanned the range of expected environmental conditions for each ontogenetic stage; however, salinity did impact juvenile and adult survival under high fluctuation.The higher thermal tolerance we observed in larval Delta Smelt relative to older stages is consistent with their developmental and evolutionary history. Delta Smelt swim bladder and fin development are not complete until âˆ¼65â€…dph (âˆ¼20â€…mm total length; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C50">Mager <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), when they can fully control their buoyancy and efficiently use tidal and river currents to migrate. Before this time, they are likely to have limited control over their movements and are thought to be mostly demersal in shallow shoaling sandy areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C50">Mager <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C52">Moyle <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>) where temperatures can quickly increase. The understanding of Delta Smelt larval behaviour and habitat preferences is currently limited to a few laboratory and field survey studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C1">Baskerville-Bridges <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C21">Dege and Brown, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C50">Mager <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), and Delta Smelt larvae have been observed in deeper river channel habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C35">Grimaldo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). However, if Delta Smelt have indeed evolved to use shallow shoaling sandy areas during these early ontogenetic stages, this could contribute to the increased thermal tolerance we observed in larval and late-larval stages. Organisms with limited mobility may exhibit higher environmental stress tolerance relative to mobile organisms that can cope behaviourally by moving to areas with favourable environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C51">Menge and Olson, 1990</xref>), so it may be that larval Delta Smelt with limited mobility may experience selective pressures favouring enhanced thermal tolerance. There is also some evidence that water export pumping schedules in the SFE may recently have favoured survival of smaller, late-spawned larval fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C10">Bennett <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C7">Bennett, 2011</xref>). If this is the case, anthropogenically driven selection coupled with seasonal conditions could also contribute to enhanced thermal tolerance because late-spawned larval fish must be able to survive in warmer late spring and early summer shallow waters.Species with the highest risk of extinction from climate change are those that have little tolerance for warming, limited acclimation capacity and tight constraints on dispersal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C22">Deutsch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). While these concepts have primarily been taken to confer that tropical species are at higher risk relative to temperate species, these criteria are also met by many endemic aquatic species. These species include temperate fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C29">Ficke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C53">Muhlfeld <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) that are adapted to regional conditions and confined to lakes, riverine or estuarine ecosystems that offer few avenues of dispersal. Native SFE fishes are adapted to the local abiotic conditions and have very little ability to disperse poleward if water temperatures make their current habitat unsuitable. As an endemic fish with largely non-overlapping generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C6">Bennett, 2005</xref>), Delta Smelt population persistence relies on individuals surviving high larval mortality pressures each year to reach reproductive stages. Coupled with water temperatures being closest to juvenile tolerance limits, these life-history dynamics potentially make Delta Smelt especially susceptible to population decline from a single hot year. Conversely, providing suitable thermal habitat for juveniles can also potentially have positive impacts on the population. Understanding these relationships provides insight into where and when to target management efforts. Recent climate-change assessments indicate that SFE waters are likely to become warmer and the low-salinity zone may move further upstream, limiting optimal habitat for Delta Smelt in the absence of mitigation actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C13">Brown <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Effective conservation strategies to ensure that Delta Smelt habitat maintains suitable thermal conditions during summer and autumn may prove to be critical for the sustainability of this species in the wild.Post-spawning Delta Smelt had higher WT despite their lowered tolerances because of the seasonal timing of this stage during winter and spring. However, a small percentage of adults are estimated to survive their first year post-spawning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C6">Bennett, 2005</xref>), but to reach a second reproductive season they must be able to cope with environmental fluctuations throughout the following year. Second-year fish have higher fecundity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C6">Bennett, 2005</xref>) but are rarely observed <italic>in situ</italic>, limiting their reproductive contribution to the population. While the lack of 2-year-old Delta Smelt in the wild may be attributable to many factors, such as food limitation, disease or susceptibility to predation, if they are not able to improve their tolerance after recovering from spawning, the thermal sensitivity of post-spawning fish may also play an important role in limiting their presence due to heightened water temperatures in summer and early autumn. The substantially lowered thermal tolerance of post-spawning adults also underscores the importance of considering timing of abiotic stressors with biological stressors, such as the energetic costs of gonadal development, migration and spawning, in evaluating species' sensitivity to climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C56">Perry <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C57">PÃ¶rtner and Farrell, 2008</xref>).In complex ecosystems with multiple stressors, such as the SFE, isolation and evaluation of the effects of individual factors is critical to understanding their contribution to observations <italic>in situ</italic>. Despite the high salinity tolerance we observed, the distribution of juvenile and adult Delta Smelt in the SFE has been strongly correlated with the low-salinity zone (1â€“6â€…ppt; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C6">Bennett, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C28">Feyrer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). This suggests that other factors limit their ability to expand into high salinities, such as reduced physiological performance due to osmoregulatory costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C37">Hasenbein <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) or other ecological elements that co-vary with salinity, e.g. marine predators, food resources or habitat structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C6">Bennett, 2005</xref>). Thus, while the fundamental niche of Delta Smelt encompasses a wide salinity range, their realized niche may be principally in the low-salinity zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C43">Hutchinson, 1957</xref>), and the combined impacts of climate change and increased anthropogenic resource demands pushing the low-salinity zone further upstream could reduce Delta Smelt optimal habitat.Our study demonstrates the need to consider life history in assessing climate-change impacts, particularly for species adapted to spatially and temporally heterogeneous environments. Synergistic effects between climate and other anthropogenic threats have been predicted to intensify climate-change impacts in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU008C36">Harley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), and are also likely to occur in the highly anthropogenically modified SFE unless effective conservation approaches are implemented. With the multitude of biological stressors and competing human resource use needs in the SFE, this will undoubtedly be very challenging; however, understanding the physiological capacity of sensitive organisms to cope with altered temperature and salinity regimens is critical to the development of successful conservation and restoration strategies.<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/conphys/cou008/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary material is available at <italic>Conservation Physiology</italic> online.</ext-link>This work was supported by the University of California Agricultural Experiment Station [grant number 2098-H to N.A.F.], the United States Department of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation [contract number R12AP20018 to R.E.C. and N.A.F.], the State and Federal Contractors Water Agency [grant number 201301957 to R.E.C.] and the California Delta Stewardship Council [contract number 201015533 to R.E.C. and N.A.F.].
