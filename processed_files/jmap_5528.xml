Did dinosaurs have any relation with dungâ€beetles? (The origin of coprophagy)It is widely accepted that Mesozoic ecosystems were basically similar to Cenozoic ecosystems and it has been proposed that the role of dungâ€beetles in those ecosystems was identical to that of today, but the dung of dinosaurs were used as a source of food instead of the dung of mammals. While dinosaurs have been known since Triassic, Scarabeids are present in the fossil records probably since Lower Jurassic. But a very important metabolic feature of dinosaurs has not been taken into account, the connection between digestive and uroâ€genital systems. So here we propose the hypothesis that coprophagy in dungâ€beetles has been associated, since it began, with mammals.
