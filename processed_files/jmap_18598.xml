Carbon Dioxide Flux from Three Arctic Tundra Types in North-Central Alaska, U.S.A.Carbon dioxide output from lichen-heath, low shrub tundra, and Eriophorum vaginatum tussock tundra was measured several times in July and August at five locations in north-central Alaska. Carbon dioxide evolution was lowest in the shrub tundra, intermediate in the lichen-heath, and highest in tussock and intertussock areas. Seasonal averages were 2.3 g CO2ám 2ád 1 from tussock tundra, 1.4 g CO2ám 2ád 1 from shrub tundra, and 1.7 g CO2ám 2ád 1 from lichen-heath. The sites differed in carbon dioxide output in complex ways. The carbon dioxide output declined from late July through August. Rough carbon budgets indicate that lichen-heath is accumulating carbon slowly and tussock tundra rapidly. Shrub tundra should also be accumulating carbon rapidly, but the current standing crops of carbon do not support this conclusion.
