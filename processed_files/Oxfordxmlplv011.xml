A recent study of  Acacia senegal  showed a geographic pattern of genetic variation, which differentiated East and Southern African populations from those in the Sudano-Sahelian region. We build on this previous research to explore variation in DNA content using the flow cytometry method and chromosome number. A geographic north-south DNA content pattern was detected, reflecting the previous results. These results suggest that DNA content may also be important in elucidating the evolutionary history and distribution of the species. Use of external tissues of dried twigs in flow cytometry is new, and presents the opportunity to study numerous other dryland woody species.  Knowledge of rangewide variation in DNA content and ploidy level may be valuable in understanding the evolutionary history of a species. Recent studies of  Acacia senegal  report diploids and occasional tetraploids in the Sudano-Sahelian region of sub-Saharan Africa, but nothing is known about the overall extent of DNA ploidy variation within the species. In this study, we determine the DNA content and ploidy level of  A. senegal  across its native range, and explore whether the variation is related to its evolutionary and colonization history. We used propidium iodide flow cytometry (FCM) to estimate DNA content (2C value) and infer ploidy in 157 individuals from 54 populations on various tissues, using seeds, fresh leaves, dried leaves and twigs and herbarium specimens. The mean 2C DNA (pg Â± s.d.) contents detected were 1.47 Â± 0.09, 2.12 Â± 0.02, 2.89 Â± 0.12, and a single individual with 4.51 pg, corresponding to a polyploid series of diploid, triploid, tetraploid and hexaploid individuals. Diploids were confirmed by chromosome counts (2 n  = 2 x  = 26). Most populations (90.7 %) were of single ploidy level, while mixed ploidy populations (9.3 %) comprising mostly diploids (2 x +3 x , 2 x +4 x  and 2 x +6 x ) were restricted to the Sudano-Sahelian and Indian subcontinent regions, its northern range. The species is predominantly diploid, and no mixed ploidy populations were detected in east and southern Africa, its southern range. The geographic pattern of ploidy variation in conjunction with existing phylogeographic and phylogenetic data of the species suggests that polyploids have occurred multiple times in its evolutionary and recent colonization history, including contemporary ecological timescales. The successful use of external tissues of dried twigs in FCM is new, and presents the opportunity to study numerous other dryland woody species.  Polyploidy, also known as whole-genome duplication, is widely recognized as a major driver of evolution, diversification and speciation in angiosperms ( Soltis  et al . 2009 ;  Wood  et al . 2009 ;  Robertson  et al . 2010 ). Cytological, fossil and genomic studies suggest that polyploidy is ancient and widespread, with most angiosperms estimated to have undergone one or more polyploidization events during their evolutionary history ( Cui  et al . 2006 ;  Soltis  et al . 2009 ;  Wood  et al . 2009 ;  Jiao  et al . 2011 ). Further analyses of cytogenetic and phylogenetic databases indicate that up to 15 % of angiosperm speciation events are accompanied by ploidy increase ( Otto and Whitton 2000 ;  Wood  et al . 2009 ), although this number is likely to grow as more species are studied.  The establishment and maintenance of polyploids will depend on a range of complex ecological and reproductive processes that promote reproductive and/or spatial isolation between the newly formed polyploid plants and their progenitors ( Thompson and Lumaret 1992 ;  Petit  et al . 1999 ;  Baack 2004 ). Following genome multiplication, novel genetic combinations arise that may confer polyploids with different reproductive, morphological, ecological, physiological or cytological characteristics from their progenitors, allowing them to exploit new environments ( KolÃ¡Å™  et al . 2009 ;  Manzaneda  et al . 2012 ;  Hao  et al . 2013 ).  Variations in 2C DNA content and ploidy levels are not uncommon among closely related species, and can also be useful in delimiting taxonomically complex species (e.g.  KolÃ¡Å™  et al . 2009 ;  Peirson  et al . 2012 ). Furthermore, analysing 1Cx (monoploid) DNA may also be useful in comparing diploidâ€“polyploid complexes across the natural range of the species; several workers have used the constancy in monoploid DNA as evidence of autopolyploidy ( Balao  et al . 2009 ;  Duchoslav  et al . 2013 ;  KrejÄÃ­kovÃ¡  et al . 2013 ). In many instances, polyploids and their diploid progenitors may co-occur across geographic regions referred to as contact zones, which can be useful in understanding the processes involved in their origins and evolutionary history ( Husband and Schemske 1998 ;  Petit  et al . 1999 ). Diploidâ€“polyploid contact zones may occur in two ways, namely (i) a primary contact zone, arising from the emergence of a new ploidy level within a diploid population, and (ii) a secondary contact zone, formed following contact between diploid and polyploid populations that were geographically isolated and have probably differentiated in allopatry ( Petit  et al . 1999 ). Several studies show that contact zones may either be localized or span wide geographic distances, and the dynamics of diploidâ€“polyploid contact zones vary with species or species complexes (e.g.  Ranunculus adoneus ,  Baack 2004 ;  Melampodium  spp.,  Steussy  et al . 2004 ;  Dianthus broteri ,  Balao  et al . 2009 ;  Ulmus americana ,  Whittemore and Olsen 2011 ;  Aster amellus ,  Castro  et al . 2012 ;  Allium oleraceum ,  Duchoslav  et al . 2013 ;  Oxalis obtusa ,  KrejÄÃ­kovÃ¡  et al . 2013 ).  Recent genomic investigations indicate that polyploidy is common in angiosperm lineages including the legume family, and it is postulated that ancient genome-doubling events may be associated with the rapid diversification of this family ( Soltis  et al . 2009 ;  Cannon  et al . 2010 ). Legumes are reported to have undergone rapid family-diversification since the Tertiary, which corresponded, for instance, with polyploidization within Papilionoideae ( Cannon  et al . 2010 ), and emergence of many species as recently as the Plio-Pleistocene ( Richardson  et al . 2001 ;  Lavin  et al . 2005 ). In Africa, acacias ( Acacia  Miller s.l., Mimosoideae) diversified during the Pliocene, colonized, expanded and became integral to open, arid-adapted vegetationâ€”the savanna woodlands ( Bouchenak-Khelladi  et al . 2010 ;  Odee  et al . 2012 ). Globally, the genus  Acacia  includes &gt;1400 species, and is an important phytogeographic component of the tropics ( Lewis  et al . 2005 ). However, genome sizes (2C DNA contents) have been explored in only a few species ( Bennett and Leitch 2012 ).  The  Acacia senegal  species: (A) an  A. senegal  woodland savanna during the rainy season, Ngarendare, Kenya; (B) characteristic alternate bipinnate leaves of  A. senegal  used in FCM analysis as fresh or desiccated tissue, a pair of secateurs is placed for scale; (C) gum arabic â€˜nodulesâ€™ formed on a leafless branch of an  A. senegal  tree 2 weeks after tapping (debarking) at the beginning of dry season at Dahra experimental field trial, Senegal; (D) shows gum â€˜nodulesâ€™ and twigs on protective glove, they were collected from leafless gum-producing trees, the twigs were stored in silica gel and used in FCM analysis; (E)  A. senegal  tree in Ntumburi, near Isiolo, Kenya; (F)  A. senegal  trees during rainy and (G) dry season at Dahra, Senegal, also showing a goat feeding on fallen pods and seeds.  A recent phylogeographic and phylogenetic study by  Odee  et al . (2012)  based on ITS and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) data showed geographic structuring of genetic variation, which separated east and southern African populations (the southern range of the species) from those in west and central Africa within the Sudano-Sahelian region (the northern range). It further inferred that hybridization and introgression were likely to have driven the recent colonization and range expansion of the species in the northern ranges. If the generally held view that polyploidy may confer broader ecological tolerance and colonization ability is true for this species, then we would expect to detect differences in ploidy diversity and distribution within and among populations and regions.  Therefore, we employed flow cytometry (FCM) to survey and assess the rangewide distribution patterns of DNA contents and ploidy levels of  A. senegal , and specifically addressed the following questions: (i) What is the variation in overall (2C DNA content) and monoploid (1Cx DNA content) genome size? (ii) What is the ploidy variation and distribution pattern across its native range? (iii) Are the ploidy levels phylogeographically and phylogenetically structured? The ploidy data are discussed in the context of origins, evolutionary and recent colonization history of the species. Furthermore, due to difficulties associated with collecting fresh leaf samples in rangewide studies conducted remote from appropriate facilities, we tested a range of tissues, namely seed, fresh leaf and twig, dried leaf and twig and herbarium specimens to evaluate their utility in FCM analysis.  Locations of all sampled populations of  Acacia senegal , and DNA contents and ploidy levels determined by FCM. 2C DNA values are presented by the mean of all individuals at each population ( n , number of individuals) Â± standard deviation (Mean Â± s.d.). Populations represented by a single individual are denoted by n/a (not applicable), in the 2C DNA range (min-max) column. Materials originated from field trials, FT; natural fields, NF; procured seeds (PS) and herbarium specimens (H). Chromosome counts determined in populations marked by single (*), this study, and double (**), previous study ( Assoumane  et al . 2013 ).  Chromosome numbers were determined from mitotically active root tip meristems of seedlings germinated from seeds from two populations (Kibwezi and Fallatu, TableÂ  1 ) using standard methods described for acacias ( Bukhari 1997 a  ). Chromosome counts for other populations, namely Kidira, Somo and Tourba; and Sodera, representing both diploids and tetraploids have previously been determined ( Assoumane  et al . 2013 ). Chromosome counts in other populations from previous studies are presented  [see  Supporting Informationâ€”Table S2 ] .  All 157 individuals were subjected to DNA content and ploidy-level estimation using FCM. Sample preparation followed the one-step protocol of  DoleÅ¾el  et al . (2007) , using an internal plant standard and propidium iodide (PI) dye, which is a DNA selective fluorochrome with no base specificity, and Tris Â· MgCl 2  buffer ( DoleÅ¾el  et al . 2007 ). For each sample, 1 mL of chilled buffer was placed in a small (5 cm diameter) Petri dish, on ice. Twigs were wiped with damp tissue to remove surface debris, and gently scraped with a razor blade, removing tangential slivers of the outer layers of the tissues, up to and including the green cambial layer, and the scrapings (4 mg) were collected into the buffer. For leaf samples, 4 mg of fresh or dried tissue of the test plant were used. Fresh leaf tissue (25 mg) of a DNA primary reference standard of glasshouse-grown tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum  â€˜StupickÃ© polnÃ­ ranÃ©â€™, 2C = 1.96 pg DNA), soya bean ( Glycine max  Merr. â€˜Polankaâ€™, 2C = 2.50 pg DNA) or maize ( Zea mays  â€˜CE-777, 2C = 5.43 pg DNA) plants ( DoleÅ¾el  et al . 2007 ) were chopped together with the test samples with a new feather-edge razor blade, cutting pieces measuring 0.5â€“2 mm across (taking âˆ¼60â€“90 s). For seeds, radicle tissue was used as described by  ÅšliwiÅ„ska  et al . (2005)  to avoid endoreduplicated cells in endosperms. The resultant suspension was collected into a 1 mL pipette and filtered through squares of 42-Âµm nylon mesh (Sefar AG, Switzerland) into standard 5-mL flow cytometer collection tubes, on ice. RNase was added to prevent staining of double-stranded RNA, followed by PI to attain final concentrations of 80 Âµg mL âˆ’1  for both. Samples were then briefly and gently vortexed to mix, and incubated on ice in the dark until they were measured (usually within 10â€“50 min).  The use of different tissues was tested in a range of studies, including comparisons of data collected from fresh leaves and twigs from the same plant, and dried leaves and stems from the same plant. Analyses were repeated on several samples to determine the reliability of the data obtained.  Samples were analysed with a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer (San Jose, CA, USA), equipped with an argon-ion 488-nm wavelength laser, calibrated daily and run on the low flow rate. Counts were collected using the FL2 (orange) detector with a band-pass filter of 585/42 nm. The default threshold setting on FL2 was used (channel 52). Instrument settings (voltage and gain) were adjusted to allow for fluorescence intensity of expected ploidy levels, together with the peak of the reference plant, to be located between channels 250â€“750 on the  x -axis (using a 1024 scale) of plots of counts of nuclei vs FL2A. Forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) were set to logarithmic scales, and FL2 was set to linear.  Data were acquired with CellQuest software (v4.0.2; Becton Dickinson) and subsequently analysed using Cyflogicâ„¢ software (version 1.2.1; Cyflo Ltd, Finland), determining the DNA content of the test sample against that of the internal reference standard. Gating of the populations of interest was done first on the FSC/SSC dot plot, and then on the FL2A (area) vs FL2W (width) dot plot to remove debris and doublets, and histograms of a number of nuclei vs channel number (relative fluorescence) were then plotted. The peak mean channel number and full peak coefficients of variation (CV) of each peak were determined. DNA contents of the samples were calculated from the ratios of the peak mean channel numbers of the test and reference plant material. The samples were assigned to ploidy levels based on the available chromosome counts and their DNA contents.  Rangewide distribution of  A. senegal  ploidy levels identified by colour (see legend). Circle area and pie slice represent sample size and relative frequency. Dark lines indicate precise geographic location of the populations.  The DNA ploidy data of analysed individuals were also located on the phylogenetic tree (maximum parsimony strict consensus tree) of  A. senegal  based on ITS sequence dataÂ (Fig.Â  4 ) ( Odee  et al . 2012 ). Examples of FCM histograms collected from different tissue types are provided in   Supporting Informationâ€”Fig. S1  .  Chromosome numbers for Kibwezi ( A. senegal  var.  kerensis ) and Fallatu ( A. senegal  var.  senegal ) populations were 2 n  = 26, corresponding to diploid.

Means not significantly different at  P  &lt; 0.05 are indicated by the same letter (Tukey's post test, or two-tailed unpaired  t -test). Horizontal lines represent the median, and boxes and whiskers, respectively, the interquartile range and the non-outlier ranges. Circles denote outliers. An asterisk (*) indicates the single hexaploid DNA content value (4.51 pg) is not included in the ANOVA analysis.  The 2C DNA contents of all 157 individuals ranged from 1.25 to 4.51 pg (TableÂ  1 )  [see  Supporting Information, Table S1 ] . Taking both fresh and dried  A. senegal  tissue samples into consideration, we found mean 2C DNA (pg Â± s.d.) contents of 1.47 Â± 0.09 ( n  = 126), 2.12 Â± 0.02 ( n  = 3), 2.89 Â± 0.12 ( n  = 28), and a single individual with 4.51 pg, corresponding to a polyploid series of diploid, triploid, tetraploid and hexaploid (TableÂ  1 )  [see  Supporting Information, Table S1 ] . The mean 2C DNA contents of fresh samples from Kibwezi and Fallatu, 1.40 Â± 0.04 pg ( n  = 3) and 1.34 Â± 0.03 pg ( n  = 4), respectively, were confirmed as diploids by chromosome counts (2 n  = 2 x  = 26). The Sodera population had a mean 2C DNA value of 2.93 Â± 0.03 pg ( n  = 5; TableÂ  1 ) and was recently confirmed as tetraploid with chromosome counts (2 n  = 4 x  = 52) and microsatellite markers ( Assoumane  et al . 2013 ). In essence, 2C DNA values for the predominant diploids varied from 1.25 to 1.64 pg (1.31-fold variation,  n  = 126), while tetraploids ranged from 2.69 to 3.09 pg (1.15-fold,  n  = 28), and the rare triploids, 2.13 to 2.17 pg (1.02-fold,  n  = 3). Most populations (90.7 %) were of single ploidy level (i.e. uniform ploidy; 2 x , 3 x  or 4 x ), while five populations (9.3 %) presented mixed ploidy levels as follows: diploid and tetraploid (Aite, Ngane and Jodhpur), diploid and triploid (Karofane) and diploid and hexaploid (Kidira), all of which were in the Sudano-Sahelian and Indian subcontinent regions (TableÂ  1 , Fig.Â  2 )  [see  Supporting Information, Table S1 ] . Triploid and hexaploid individuals were rare. The triploid individuals occurred in Maroua, Cameroon and Karofane, Niger (Fig.Â  2 , TableÂ  1 ). Both triploids and the hexaploid detected by FCM are reported for the first time, but have not been confirmed by chromosome counts due to their rarity.  The overall distribution pattern of ploidy levels is shown in Fig.Â  2  (TableÂ  1 )  [see  Supporting Informationâ€”Table S2   with additional data from previous studies ( Bukhari 1997 b  ,   c  ;  Assoumane  et al . 2013 ) ] . Diploids were the most common and widespread, occurring in the entire natural geographic range of the species.  Acacia dudgeoni  (analysed in this study) and  A. asak  (previously reported by  Bukhari (1997 b ) ) are also diploids  [see  Supporting Informationâ€”Table S2 ] . Tetraploids, the rare triploids and hexaploid individuals occur in the Sudano-Sahelian region. Only two tetraploid populations occur in the east African Highlands (Sodera, Ethiopia, and Ntumburi, Kenya), while populations south of the Equator were all diploids. Both diploids and tetraploids were also detected in populations from Pakistan and India in spite of limited sampling of these regions. Interestingly, all detected polyploids belonged to  A. senegal  var.  senegal , although diploids were still the majority in this taxon, and none were detected in the vars.  kerensis ,  leorhachis ,  rostrata  or  A. dudgeoni .  Bayesian 50 % majority-rule consensus phylogram of ITS sequences (GenBank accession numbers HQ605042â€“HQ605077) from  Acacia senegal  individuals sampled across its distribution range (adapted from  Odee  et al . 2012 ). Each haplotype is labelled by H and the number (1â€“36), followed by the DNA ploidy indicated in bold where analysed. Branches are labelled with â‰¥70 % bootstrap support (below) and posterior probability (above) values. Arrow indicates presence of a single clade in the maximum parsimony strict consensus tree. The tree was rooted with  Acacia  (syn.  Vachellia )  farnesiana  and  Acacia  (syn.  Vachellia )  collinsii  (see inset tree, double line denotes the point at which the break is in the main tree) obtained via GenBank (accession numbers EF638219 and EF638216, respectively).  Acacia senegal  sequence is accession number EF638213 from Zimbabwe (ploidy unknown). Clades are identified by vertical (dark) lines, labelled with constituent  A. senegal  varieties ( senegal ,  kerensis ,  rostrata  and  leiorhachis ). Hypothesized recent range expansion and early colonization and fragmentation events are indicated by light and dark grey vertical bars. Scale bar signifies 0.1 substitutions per nucleotide site.  Our main objective to survey and assess the rangewide distribution patterns of DNA contents and ploidy levels of  A. senegal  was dependent on the utility and reliability of the FCM methodological innovations we developed in order to circumvent the difficulties associated with collecting fresh leaf samples in the speciesâ€™ native range. While other studies have tested the use of herbarium leaf samples, our use of the outer tissues of dried twigs is novel. Flow cytometry comparison of fresh leaf and twig and dried leaf and twig indicated that they yielded similar results  [see  Supporting Information  â€”Fig. S1   ] . Both dried leaves and dried twigs showed elevated 2C DNA amounts (Fig.Â  3 C) relative to fresh material. Previous studies by  Bukhari (1997 c )  of six diploid populations across the northern range of the species (Sudan, Senegal, India and Pakistan)  [see  Supporting Informationâ€”Table S2 ]  yielded estimates of 1.11 Â± 0.09â€“1.17 Â± 0.04 pg (mean Â± standard error) with â€˜White Leghornâ€™ chicken ( Gallus domesticus ) erythrocytes as internal standard, compared with our fresh leaf mean 2C DNA content of 1.36 Â± 0.06 s.d. pg,  n  = 25. We attribute this difference to the internal standards used, especially as a considerable variation in 2C genome size for â€˜Leghornâ€™ chickens of different strains and sexes has been reported ( MendonÃ§a  et al . 2010 ). Our data also showed that triploid, tetraploid and hexaploid individuals had 2C DNA contents commensurate with their ploidy levels. The bulk of plant tissues used in our study were dried twigs. The estimation of DNA content from dried twig and leaf samples mostly yielded results with full peak CVs &lt;5 %, thus falling within the generally accepted upper limit ( DoleÅ¾el  et al . 2007 ). The CVs of the fresh reference plants, measured simultaneously with the test species were lower, mostly &lt;3 %. However, CVs of up to 7.57 % were also obtained in some herbarium individuals from the southern African region; these samples were long-stored leaves (up to 58 months) of herbarium specimens. As well as increasing CVs of stored tissues, storage also resulted in increased 2C DNA values; using our fresh leaf mean 2C DNA content for diploids (1.36 Â± 0.06 pg) as a benchmark, we observed an increase of 15 % for dried leaf and twig tissues stored &gt;53 months (cf. 1.57 Â± 0.07 pg), highlighting the compounding effects of desiccation and storage duration of tissue material. Nonetheless, these variations (between fresh and dried tissues) are within the ranges reported for various other species that have used either dried tissues and/or storage conditions (e.g.  Å marda and StanÄÃ­k 2006 ;  Suda and TrÃ¡vnÃ­Äek 2006 ;  Balao  et al . 2009 ;  Cires  et al . 2009 ;  Bainard  et al . 2011 ). In spite of the variation, we could still unequivocally assign samples to the appropriate ploidy.  The use of the external tissues of dried twigs in FCM analysis of woody plants is new. The only previous FCM use of twigs employed decorticated moist winter twigs of Icelandic birch species ( Betula nana  and  B. pubescens ;  Anamthawat-JÃ³nsson  et al . 2010 ). The use of dried twigs enables collections in dormant seasons and populations that are situated far from laboratory facilities for FCM determinations. This will open up opportunities for numerous other understudied dryland acacias and woody species.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest polyploid series reported for  A. senegal. Acacia tortilis , which also has a diploid chromosome count of 2 n  = 2 x  = 26, is reported to be 2 x , 3 x ,  4x  and 8 x  (e.g.  Oballa and Olng'otie 1993 ;  Bukhari 1997 b  ,   c  ;  El Ferchichi Ouarda  et al . 2009 ), and the Australian acacia,  A. dealbata  (2 x , 3 x  and 4 x ,  Blakesley  et al . 2002 ). However, unlike  A. senegal , other studied African acacias, namely  A. tortilis  and  A. nilotica , appear to be predominantly polyploids ( Bennett and Leitch 2012 ). Our results report populations of mixed ploidy in the species for the first time. Rangewide determination of DNA ploidy in  A. senegal  found diploids, triploids, tetraploids and a hexaploid including some populations with multiple ploidy levels (2 x  + 4 x , 2 x  + 3 x  and 2 x  + 6 x ). Diploids were the most common and widespread, occurring throughout the range (Fig.Â  2 ). Tetraploids constituted 17.8 % of the samples analysed, and together with the rare triploids and hexaploid, they were only found in the northern range and only with var.  senegal , mostly in the Sudano-Sahelian regions of central and west Africa. The east African region, represented by the three common varieties (vars.  senegal ,  kerensis  and  leiorhachis ), had relatively higher sampling intensity than the other regions. In this region, sampled populations immediately south of the Equator were all diploids. Further south (South Africa and Namibia), localities were represented by several single herbarium specimens of vars.  rostrata  and  leiorhachis , and were also all diploids. Thus, our results suggest that if polyploids are present in the southern range, they are likely to be in low frequencies.  The wide spatial distribution of polyploids, coupled with their occurrence at different levels in the phylogenetic tree (FigsÂ  2  and  4 ) suggests that polyploids have arisen on multiple independent occasions, including contemporary ecological times to the present. The diploidâ€“polyploid complexes shared the major haplotypes indicating gene flow among the different ploidy levels (Fig.Â  4 )  [see  Supporting Informationâ€”Table S1 ] . In particular, the distribution of diploidâ€“polyploid complexes in the terminal clade, comprising mainly the west and central African (Sudano-Sahelian region) populations, is also consistent with the hypothesis of a recent range expansion of the species in that region based on ITS and cpDNA data ( Odee  et al . 2012 ). Young polyploid complexes are characterized by many diploids and a few tetraploids (Stebbins 1971, cited by  Meyers and Levin 2006 ). In the same Sudano-Sahelian region,  Assoumane  et al . (2013)  detected three tetraploid populations not sharing the same chlorotypes, and suggested multiple origins including allopolyploidy. However, the constancy in monoploid DNA content among our diploidâ€“polyploid populations in the Sudano-Sahelian and Indian subcontinent regions also suggests the possibility of autopolyploid origin. Lack of current data on species composition, distribution and ecology, especially of  A. senegal  and potential progenitors of the ploidy series observed in this expansive and ecologically heterogeneous geographical region, does not allow for precise inferences on the origins. The documented localities of early herbarium collections (e.g.  Ross 1975 ,  1979 ;  Fagg and Allison 2004 ) show extensive distribution of the  A. senegal  complex and other congeneric populations, with similar base chromosome numbers and therefore potential sources for allopolyploidy. Clear evidence of allopolyploidy within acacia is demonstrated by the triploid  Acacia laeta  (2 n  = 39), which is a hybrid between  A. senegal  var.  senegal  and  A. mellifera  subsp.  mellifera  found in the Sudano-Sahelian region, as well as eastern Africa and the Arabian peninsula (Khan 1951, cited by  Fagg and Allison 2004 ;  Ross 1979 ). Our study did not sample any known  A. laeta  population, but we detected triploids only in three individuals found in two  A. senegal  var.  senegal  populations, Maroua and Karofane, with the latter occurring as a minority cytotype within a diploid population (2 x  + 3 x ). The two samples from Maroua were both from seed, which might not have had long-term viability, while the sample from Karofane was taken from a mature tree. These populations with triploid individuals suggest two possible scenarios: the triploids could have arisen either from a diploid Ã— tetraploid cross, or from combination of reduced and unreduced gametes of a diploid ( Petit  et al . 1999 ). However, there are no known diploid or tetraploid populations in proximity of Maroua population, Cameroun (Fig.Â  2 ).  In this study, the Sudano-Sahelian and the Indian subcontinent regions broadly represent the contact zones for diploidâ€“polyploid complexes in  A. senegal . Notwithstanding the relatively low representation of DNA content and ploidy data from the southern region, it is clearly evident from this study that there is a northâ€“south divide in diploidâ€“polyploid distribution of the species. The tetraploid Ntumburi population, from Kenya (00Â°11â€²54.7â€³N, 37Â°31â€²00.2â€³E), was the southernmost polyploid population; all of the populations south of the equator were diploids. The  Acacia senegal  species complex is young in evolutionary terms predating the Pleistocene ( Bouchenak-Khelladi  et al . 2010 ;  Odee  et al . 2012 ), and the terminal clade of the phylogenetic tree (Fig.Â  4 ) depicts a relatively recent and rapid expansion into the northern range from eastern Africa ( Odee  et al . 2012 ). This expansion may have been facilitated by the polyploidization events in the distinctive var.  senegal , which is drought-tolerant and high gum-producing compared with the other varieties ( Fagg and Allison 2004 ). The association of var.  senegal  with polyploids may also suggest that polyploidization is driving its differentiation from the other varieties. Furthermore, the diploidâ€“polyploid contact zones also appear to coincide with cpDNA haplotype disjunctions located in westernmost part of west Africa (western Senegal) and central Africa, proposed to be refugial zones for  A. senegal  during the climate oscillations of the Plio-Pleistocene ( Odee  et al . 2012 ).  Through rangewide analysis of ploidy levels, we have shown in this study that  A. senegal  is predominantly diploid, but has new ploidy levels which we report for the first time. The occurrence of diploidâ€“polyploid complexes in the northern range is congruent with existing phylogenetic and phylogeographic data and supports the hypothesis that polyploidization may have been crucial to the recent colonization and range expansion in these regions. However, further studies that employ greater sampling intensity at various spatial scales, focussing on the contact zones of the Sudano-Sahelian region, as well increasing resolution of southern African populations, will be necessary to detect whether polyploidy exists in localities and regions where it has not been reported. This study demonstrated the use of dried twigs as a good alternative source of leaf tissue for determinations of reliable DNA content and ploidy levels, which provides opportunities for rangewide screening of numerous other understudied dryland species using FCM.
