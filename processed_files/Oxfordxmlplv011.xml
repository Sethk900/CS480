We build on this previous research to explore variation in DNA content using the flow cytometry method and chromosome number. A geographic north-south DNA content pattern was detected, reflecting the previous results. These results suggest that DNA content may also be important in elucidating the evolutionary history and distribution of the species. Use of external tissues of dried twigs in flow cytometry is new, and presents the opportunity to study numerous other dryland woody species.Knowledge of rangewide variation in DNA content and ploidy level may be valuable in understanding the evolutionary history of a species. Recent studies of <italic>Acacia senegal</italic> report diploids and occasional tetraploids in the Sudano-Sahelian region of sub-Saharan Africa, but nothing is known about the overall extent of DNA ploidy variation within the species. In this study, we determine the DNA content and ploidy level of <italic>A. senegal</italic> across its native range, and explore whether the variation is related to its evolutionary and colonization history. We used propidium iodide flow cytometry (FCM) to estimate DNA content (2C value) and infer ploidy in 157 individuals from 54 populations on various tissues, using seeds, fresh leaves, dried leaves and twigs and herbarium specimens. The mean 2C DNA (pg Â± s.d.) contents detected were 1.47 Â± 0.09, 2.12 Â± 0.02, 2.89 Â± 0.12, and a single individual with 4.51 pg, corresponding to a polyploid series of diploid, triploid, tetraploid and hexaploid individuals. Diploids were confirmed by chromosome counts (2<italic>n</italic> = 2<italic>x</italic> = 26). Most populations (90.7 %) were of single ploidy level, while mixed ploidy populations (9.3 %) comprising mostly diploids (2<italic>x</italic>+3<italic>x</italic>, 2<italic>x</italic>+4<italic>x</italic> and 2<italic>x</italic>+6<italic>x</italic>) were restricted to the Sudano-Sahelian and Indian subcontinent regions, its northern range. The species is predominantly diploid, and no mixed ploidy populations were detected in east and southern Africa, its southern range. The geographic pattern of ploidy variation in conjunction with existing phylogeographic and phylogenetic data of the species suggests that polyploids have occurred multiple times in its evolutionary and recent colonization history, including contemporary ecological timescales. The successful use of external tissues of dried twigs in FCM is new, and presents the opportunity to study numerous other dryland woody species.Polyploidy, also known as whole-genome duplication, is widely recognized as a major driver of evolution, diversification and speciation in angiosperms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C45">Soltis <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C51">Wood <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C40">Robertson <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>). Cytological, fossil and genomic studies suggest that polyploidy is ancient and widespread, with most angiosperms estimated to have undergone one or more polyploidization events during their evolutionary history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C16">Cui <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C45">Soltis <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C51">Wood <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C24">Jiao <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). Further analyses of cytogenetic and phylogenetic databases indicate that up to 15 % of angiosperm speciation events are accompanied by ploidy increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C36">Otto and Whitton 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C51">Wood <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>), although this number is likely to grow as more species are studied.The establishment and maintenance of polyploids will depend on a range of complex ecological and reproductive processes that promote reproductive and/or spatial isolation between the newly formed polyploid plants and their progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C49">Thompson and Lumaret 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C38">Petit <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C4">Baack 2004</xref>). Following genome multiplication, novel genetic combinations arise that may confer polyploids with different reproductive, morphological, ecological, physiological or cytological characteristics from their progenitors, allowing them to exploit new environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C25">KolÃ¡Å™ <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C29">Manzaneda <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C22">Hao <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>).Variations in 2C DNA content and ploidy levels are not uncommon among closely related species, and can also be useful in delimiting taxonomically complex species (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C25">KolÃ¡Å™ <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C37">Peirson <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). Furthermore, analysing 1Cx (monoploid) DNA may also be useful in comparing diploidâ€“polyploid complexes across the natural range of the species; several workers have used the constancy in monoploid DNA as evidence of autopolyploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C6">Balao <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C18">Duchoslav <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C26">KrejÄÃ­kovÃ¡ <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). In many instances, polyploids and their diploid progenitors may co-occur across geographic regions referred to as contact zones, which can be useful in understanding the processes involved in their origins and evolutionary history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C23">Husband and Schemske 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C38">Petit <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>). Diploidâ€“polyploid contact zones may occur in two ways, namely (i) a primary contact zone, arising from the emergence of a new ploidy level within a diploid population, and (ii) a secondary contact zone, formed following contact between diploid and polyploid populations that were geographically isolated and have probably differentiated in allopatry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C38">Petit <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>). Several studies show that contact zones may either be localized or span wide geographic distances, and the dynamics of diploidâ€“polyploid contact zones vary with species or species complexes (e.g. <italic>Ranunculus adoneus</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C4">Baack 2004</xref>; <italic>Melampodium</italic> spp., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C47">Steussy <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; <italic>Dianthus broteri</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C6">Balao <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <italic>Ulmus americana</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C50">Whittemore and Olsen 2011</xref>; <italic>Aster amellus</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C14">Castro <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>; <italic>Allium oleraceum</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C18">Duchoslav <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>; <italic>Oxalis obtusa</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C26">KrejÄÃ­kovÃ¡ <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>).Recent genomic investigations indicate that polyploidy is common in angiosperm lineages including the legume family, and it is postulated that ancient genome-doubling events may be associated with the rapid diversification of this family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C45">Soltis <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C13">Cannon <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>). Legumes are reported to have undergone rapid family-diversification since the Tertiary, which corresponded, for instance, with polyploidization within Papilionoideae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C13">Cannon <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>), and emergence of many species as recently as the Plio-Pleistocene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C39">Richardson <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C27">Lavin <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>). In Africa, acacias (<italic>Acacia</italic> Miller s.l., Mimosoideae) diversified during the Pliocene, colonized, expanded and became integral to open, arid-adapted vegetationâ€”the savanna woodlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C9">Bouchenak-Khelladi <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C34">Odee <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). Globally, the genus <italic>Acacia</italic> includes &gt;1400 species, and is an important phytogeographic component of the tropics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C28">Lewis <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>). However, genome sizes (2C DNA contents) have been explored in only a few species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C7">Bennett and Leitch 2012</xref>).The <italic>Acacia senegal</italic> species: (A) an <italic>A. senegal</italic> woodland savanna during the rainy season, Ngarendare, Kenya; (B) characteristic alternate bipinnate leaves of <italic>A. senegal</italic> used in FCM analysis as fresh or desiccated tissue, a pair of secateurs is placed for scale; (C) gum arabic â€˜nodulesâ€™ formed on a leafless branch of an <italic>A. senegal</italic> tree 2 weeks after tapping (debarking) at the beginning of dry season at Dahra experimental field trial, Senegal; (D) shows gum â€˜nodulesâ€™ and twigs on protective glove, they were collected from leafless gum-producing trees, the twigs were stored in silica gel and used in FCM analysis; (E) <italic>A. senegal</italic> tree in Ntumburi, near Isiolo, Kenya; (F) <italic>A. senegal</italic> trees during rainy and (G) dry season at Dahra, Senegal, also showing a goat feeding on fallen pods and seeds.A recent phylogeographic and phylogenetic study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C34">Odee <italic>et al</italic>. (2012)</xref> based on ITS and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) data showed geographic structuring of genetic variation, which separated east and southern African populations (the southern range of the species) from those in west and central Africa within the Sudano-Sahelian region (the northern range). It further inferred that hybridization and introgression were likely to have driven the recent colonization and range expansion of the species in the northern ranges. If the generally held view that polyploidy may confer broader ecological tolerance and colonization ability is true for this species, then we would expect to detect differences in ploidy diversity and distribution within and among populations and regions.Therefore, we employed flow cytometry (FCM) to survey and assess the rangewide distribution patterns of DNA contents and ploidy levels of <italic>A. senegal</italic>, and specifically addressed the following questions: (i) What is the variation in overall (2C DNA content) and monoploid (1Cx DNA content) genome size? (ii) What is the ploidy variation and distribution pattern across its native range? (iii) Are the ploidy levels phylogeographically and phylogenetically structured? The ploidy data are discussed in the context of origins, evolutionary and recent colonization history of the species. Furthermore, due to difficulties associated with collecting fresh leaf samples in rangewide studies conducted remote from appropriate facilities, we tested a range of tissues, namely seed, fresh leaf and twig, dried leaf and twig and herbarium specimens to evaluate their utility in FCM analysis.Locations of all sampled populations of <italic>Acacia senegal</italic>, and DNA contents and ploidy levels determined by FCM. 2C DNA values are presented by the mean of all individuals at each population (<italic>n</italic>, number of individuals) Â± standard deviation (Mean Â± s.d.).

Sample preparation followed the one-step protocol of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C17">DoleÅ¾el <italic>et al</italic>. (2007)</xref>, using an internal plant standard and propidium iodide (PI) dye, which is a DNA selective fluorochrome with no base specificity, and Tris Â· MgCl<sub>2</sub> buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C17">DoleÅ¾el <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). For each sample, 1 mL of chilled buffer was placed in a small (5 cm diameter) Petri dish, on ice. Twigs were wiped with damp tissue to remove surface debris, and gently scraped with a razor blade, removing tangential slivers of the outer layers of the tissues, up to and including the green cambial layer, and the scrapings (4 mg) were collected into the buffer. For leaf samples, 4 mg of fresh or dried tissue of the test plant were used. Fresh leaf tissue (25 mg) of a DNA primary reference standard of glasshouse-grown tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> â€˜StupickÃ© polnÃ­ ranÃ©â€™, 2C = 1.96 pg DNA), soya bean (<italic>Glycine max</italic> Merr. â€˜Polankaâ€™, 2C = 2.50 pg DNA) or maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic> â€˜CE-777, 2C = 5.43 pg DNA) plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C17">DoleÅ¾el <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>) were chopped together with the test samples with a new feather-edge razor blade, cutting pieces measuring 0.5â€“2 mm across (taking âˆ¼60â€“90 s). For seeds, radicle tissue was used as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C43">ÅšliwiÅ„ska <italic>et al</italic>. (2005)</xref> to avoid endoreduplicated cells in endosperms. The resultant suspension was collected into a 1 mL pipette and filtered through squares of 42-Âµm nylon mesh (Sefar AG, Switzerland) into standard 5-mL flow cytometer collection tubes, on ice. RNase was added to prevent staining of double-stranded RNA, followed by PI to attain final concentrations of 80 Âµg mL<sup>âˆ’1</sup> for both. Samples were then briefly and gently vortexed to mix, and incubated on ice in the dark until they were measured (usually within 10â€“50 min).The use of different tissues was tested in a range of studies, including comparisons of data collected from fresh leaves and twigs from the same plant, and dried leaves and stems from the same plant. Analyses were repeated on several samples to determine the reliability of the data obtained.Samples were analysed with a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer (San Jose, CA, USA), equipped with an argon-ion 488-nm wavelength laser, calibrated daily and run on the low flow rate. Counts were collected using the FL2 (orange) detector with a band-pass filter of 585/42 nm. The default threshold setting on FL2 was used (channel 52). Instrument settings (voltage and gain) were adjusted to allow for fluorescence intensity of expected ploidy levels, together with the peak of the reference plant, to be located between channels 250â€“750 on the <italic>x</italic>-axis (using a 1024 scale) of plots of counts of nuclei vs FL2A. Forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) were set to logarithmic scales, and FL2 was set to linear.Data were acquired with CellQuest software (v4.0.2; Becton Dickinson) and subsequently analysed using Cyflogicâ„¢ software (version 1.2.1; Cyflo Ltd, Finland), determining the DNA content of the test sample against that of the internal reference standard. Gating of the populations of interest was done first on the FSC/SSC dot plot, and then on the FL2A (area) vs FL2W (width) dot plot to remove debris and doublets, and histograms of a number of nuclei vs channel number (relative fluorescence) were then plotted. The peak mean channel number and full peak coefficients of variation (CV) of each peak were determined. DNA contents of the samples were calculated from the ratios of the peak mean channel numbers of the test and reference plant material. The samples were assigned to ploidy levels based on the available chromosome counts and their DNA contents.Rangewide distribution of <italic>A. senegal</italic> ploidy levels identified by colour (see legend).

Both triploids and the hexaploid detected by FCM are reported for the first time, but have not been confirmed by chromosome counts due to their rarity.The overall distribution pattern of ploidy levels is shown in Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV011F2">2</xref> (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLV011TB1">1</xref>) <bold>[see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/plv011/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supporting Informationâ€”Table S2</ext-link></bold> with additional data from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C11">Bukhari 1997<italic>b</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C12"><italic>c</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C2">Assoumane <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>)<bold>]</bold>. Diploids were the most common and widespread, occurring in the entire natural geographic range of the species. <italic>Acacia dudgeoni</italic> (analysed in this study) and <italic>A. asak</italic> (previously reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C11">Bukhari (1997<italic>b</italic>)</xref>) are also diploids <bold>[see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/plv011/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supporting Informationâ€”Table S2</ext-link>]</bold>. Tetraploids, the rare triploids and hexaploid individuals occur in the Sudano-Sahelian region. Only two tetraploid populations occur in the east African Highlands (Sodera, Ethiopia, and Ntumburi, Kenya), while populations south of the Equator were all diploids. Both diploids and tetraploids were also detected in populations from Pakistan and India in spite of limited sampling of these regions. Interestingly, all detected polyploids belonged to <italic>A. senegal</italic> var. <italic>senegal</italic>, although diploids were still the majority in this taxon, and none were detected in the vars. <italic>kerensis</italic>, <italic>leorhachis</italic>, <italic>rostrata</italic> or <italic>A. dudgeoni</italic>.Bayesian 50 % majority-rule consensus phylogram of ITS sequences (GenBank accession numbers HQ605042â€“HQ605077) from <italic>Acacia senegal</italic> individuals sampled across its distribution range (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C34">Odee <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). Each haplotype is labelled by H and the number (1â€“36), followed by the DNA ploidy indicated in bold where analysed.

While other studies have tested the use of herbarium leaf samples, our use of the outer tissues of dried twigs is novel. Flow cytometry comparison of fresh leaf and twig and dried leaf and twig indicated that they yielded similar results <bold>[see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/plv011/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supporting Information</ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/plv011/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">â€”Fig. S1</ext-link></bold><bold>]</bold>. Both dried leaves and dried twigs showed elevated 2C DNA amounts (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV011F3">3</xref>C) relative to fresh material. Previous studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C12">Bukhari (1997<italic>c</italic>)</xref> of six diploid populations across the northern range of the species (Sudan, Senegal, India and Pakistan) <bold>[see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/plv011/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supporting Informationâ€”Table S2</ext-link>]</bold> yielded estimates of 1.11 Â± 0.09â€“1.17 Â± 0.04 pg (mean Â± standard error) with â€˜White Leghornâ€™ chicken (<italic>Gallus domesticus</italic>) erythrocytes as internal standard, compared with our fresh leaf mean 2C DNA content of 1.36 Â± 0.06 s.d. pg, <italic>n</italic> = 25. We attribute this difference to the internal standards used, especially as a considerable variation in 2C genome size for â€˜Leghornâ€™ chickens of different strains and sexes has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C30">MendonÃ§a <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>). Our data also showed that triploid, tetraploid and hexaploid individuals had 2C DNA contents commensurate with their ploidy levels. The bulk of plant tissues used in our study were dried twigs. The estimation of DNA content from dried twig and leaf samples mostly yielded results with full peak CVs &lt;5 %, thus falling within the generally accepted upper limit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C17">DoleÅ¾el <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). The CVs of the fresh reference plants, measured simultaneously with the test species were lower, mostly &lt;3 %. However, CVs of up to 7.57 % were also obtained in some herbarium individuals from the southern African region; these samples were long-stored leaves (up to 58 months) of herbarium specimens. As well as increasing CVs of stored tissues, storage also resulted in increased 2C DNA values; using our fresh leaf mean 2C DNA content for diploids (1.36 Â± 0.06 pg) as a benchmark, we observed an increase of 15 % for dried leaf and twig tissues stored &gt;53 months (cf. 1.57 Â± 0.07 pg), highlighting the compounding effects of desiccation and storage duration of tissue material. Nonetheless, these variations (between fresh and dried tissues) are within the ranges reported for various other species that have used either dried tissues and/or storage conditions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C44">Å marda and StanÄÃ­k 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C48">Suda and TrÃ¡vnÃ­Äek 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C6">Balao <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C15">Cires <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C5">Bainard <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). In spite of the variation, we could still unequivocally assign samples to the appropriate ploidy.The use of the external tissues of dried twigs in FCM analysis of woody plants is new. The only previous FCM use of twigs employed decorticated moist winter twigs of Icelandic birch species (<italic>Betula nana</italic> and <italic>B. pubescens</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C1">Anamthawat-JÃ³nsson <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>). The use of dried twigs enables collections in dormant seasons and populations that are situated far from laboratory facilities for FCM determinations. This will open up opportunities for numerous other understudied dryland acacias and woody species.To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest polyploid series reported for <italic>A. senegal. Acacia tortilis</italic>, which also has a diploid chromosome count of 2<italic>n</italic> = 2<italic>x</italic> = 26, is reported to be 2<italic>x</italic>, 3<italic>x</italic>, <italic>4x</italic> and 8<italic>x</italic> (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C32">Oballa and Olng'otie 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C11">Bukhari 1997<italic>b</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C12"><italic>c</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C19">El Ferchichi Ouarda <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>), and the Australian acacia, <italic>A. dealbata</italic> (2<italic>x</italic>, 3<italic>x</italic> and 4<italic>x</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C8">Blakesley <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>). However, unlike <italic>A. senegal</italic>, other studied African acacias, namely <italic>A. tortilis</italic> and <italic>A. nilotica</italic>, appear to be predominantly polyploids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C7">Bennett and Leitch 2012</xref>). Our results report populations of mixed ploidy in the species for the first time. Rangewide determination of DNA ploidy in <italic>A. senegal</italic> found diploids, triploids, tetraploids and a hexaploid including some populations with multiple ploidy levels (2<italic>x</italic> + 4<italic>x</italic>, 2<italic>x</italic> + 3<italic>x</italic> and 2<italic>x</italic> + 6<italic>x</italic>). Diploids were the most common and widespread, occurring throughout the range (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV011F2">2</xref>). Tetraploids constituted 17.8 % of the samples analysed, and together with the rare triploids and hexaploid, they were only found in the northern range and only with var. <italic>senegal</italic>, mostly in the Sudano-Sahelian regions of central and west Africa. The east African region, represented by the three common varieties (vars. <italic>senegal</italic>, <italic>kerensis</italic> and <italic>leiorhachis</italic>), had relatively higher sampling intensity than the other regions. In this region, sampled populations immediately south of the Equator were all diploids. Further south (South Africa and Namibia), localities were represented by several single herbarium specimens of vars. <italic>rostrata</italic> and <italic>leiorhachis</italic>, and were also all diploids. Thus, our results suggest that if polyploids are present in the southern range, they are likely to be in low frequencies.The wide spatial distribution of polyploids, coupled with their occurrence at different levels in the phylogenetic tree (FigsÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV011F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV011F4">4</xref>) suggests that polyploids have arisen on multiple independent occasions, including contemporary ecological times to the present. The diploidâ€“polyploid complexes shared the major haplotypes indicating gene flow among the different ploidy levels (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV011F4">4</xref>) <bold>[see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/plv011/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supporting Informationâ€”Table S1</ext-link>]</bold>. In particular, the distribution of diploidâ€“polyploid complexes in the terminal clade, comprising mainly the west and central African (Sudano-Sahelian region) populations, is also consistent with the hypothesis of a recent range expansion of the species in that region based on ITS and cpDNA data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C34">Odee <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). Young polyploid complexes are characterized by many diploids and a few tetraploids (Stebbins 1971, cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C31">Meyers and Levin 2006</xref>). In the same Sudano-Sahelian region, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C2">Assoumane <italic>et al</italic>. (2013)</xref> detected three tetraploid populations not sharing the same chlorotypes, and suggested multiple origins including allopolyploidy. However, the constancy in monoploid DNA content among our diploidâ€“polyploid populations in the Sudano-Sahelian and Indian subcontinent regions also suggests the possibility of autopolyploid origin. Lack of current data on species composition, distribution and ecology, especially of <italic>A. senegal</italic> and potential progenitors of the ploidy series observed in this expansive and ecologically heterogeneous geographical region, does not allow for precise inferences on the origins. The documented localities of early herbarium collections (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C41">Ross 1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C42">1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C20">Fagg and Allison 2004</xref>) show extensive distribution of the <italic>A. senegal</italic> complex and other congeneric populations, with similar base chromosome numbers and therefore potential sources for allopolyploidy. Clear evidence of allopolyploidy within acacia is demonstrated by the triploid <italic>Acacia laeta</italic> (2<italic>n</italic> = 39), which is a hybrid between <italic>A. senegal</italic> var. <italic>senegal</italic> and <italic>A. mellifera</italic> subsp. <italic>mellifera</italic> found in the Sudano-Sahelian region, as well as eastern Africa and the Arabian peninsula (Khan 1951, cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C20">Fagg and Allison 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C42">Ross 1979</xref>). Our study did not sample any known <italic>A. laeta</italic> population, but we detected triploids only in three individuals found in two <italic>A. senegal</italic> var. <italic>senegal</italic> populations, Maroua and Karofane, with the latter occurring as a minority cytotype within a diploid population (2<italic>x</italic> + 3<italic>x</italic>). The two samples from Maroua were both from seed, which might not have had long-term viability, while the sample from Karofane was taken from a mature tree. These populations with triploid individuals suggest two possible scenarios: the triploids could have arisen either from a diploid Ã— tetraploid cross, or from combination of reduced and unreduced gametes of a diploid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C38">Petit <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>). However, there are no known diploid or tetraploid populations in proximity of Maroua population, Cameroun (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV011F2">2</xref>).In this study, the Sudano-Sahelian and the Indian subcontinent regions broadly represent the contact zones for diploidâ€“polyploid complexes in <italic>A. senegal</italic>. Notwithstanding the relatively low representation of DNA content and ploidy data from the southern region, it is clearly evident from this study that there is a northâ€“south divide in diploidâ€“polyploid distribution of the species. The tetraploid Ntumburi population, from Kenya (00Â°11â€²54.7â€³N, 37Â°31â€²00.2â€³E), was the southernmost polyploid population; all of the populations south of the equator were diploids. The <italic>Acacia senegal</italic> species complex is young in evolutionary terms predating the Pleistocene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C9">Bouchenak-Khelladi <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C34">Odee <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>), and the terminal clade of the phylogenetic tree (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV011F4">4</xref>) depicts a relatively recent and rapid expansion into the northern range from eastern Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C34">Odee <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). This expansion may have been facilitated by the polyploidization events in the distinctive var. <italic>senegal</italic>, which is drought-tolerant and high gum-producing compared with the other varieties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C20">Fagg and Allison 2004</xref>). The association of var. <italic>senegal</italic> with polyploids may also suggest that polyploidization is driving its differentiation from the other varieties. Furthermore, the diploidâ€“polyploid contact zones also appear to coincide with cpDNA haplotype disjunctions located in westernmost part of west Africa (western Senegal) and central Africa, proposed to be refugial zones for <italic>A. senegal</italic> during the climate oscillations of the Plio-Pleistocene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV011C34">Odee <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>).Through rangewide analysis of ploidy levels, we have shown in this study that <italic>A. senegal</italic> is predominantly diploid, but has new ploidy levels which we report for the first time. The occurrence of diploidâ€“polyploid complexes in the northern range is congruent with existing phylogenetic and phylogeographic data and supports the hypothesis that polyploidization may have been crucial to the recent colonization and range expansion in these regions. However, further studies that employ greater sampling intensity at various spatial scales, focussing on the contact zones of the Sudano-Sahelian region, as well increasing resolution of southern African populations, will be necessary to detect whether polyploidy exists in localities and regions where it has not been reported. This study demonstrated the use of dried twigs as a good alternative source of leaf tissue for determinations of reliable DNA content and ploidy levels, which provides opportunities for rangewide screening of numerous other understudied dryland species using FCM.This work was supported by the <grant-sponsor xlink:type="simple">European Commission</grant-sponsor>, through the <grant-sponsor xlink:type="simple">ACACIAGUM Project</grant-sponsor> [FP6 Contract No. <grant-num xlink:type="simple">032233</grant-num>].
