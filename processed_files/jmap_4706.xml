Survival of Ralstonia solanacearum biovar 2 in soil under different cropping systemsSurvival of Ralstonia solanacearum biovar 2 (race 3) was monitored in an artificially infested field over a five year period. Four cultural practices (maize monoculture, potato monoculture, bare fallow and weed-fallow) were applied. Ralstonia populations in the soil were quantified by planting potatoes in sub-plots of all treatments after a three-year and five-year cropping sequence. In the potato monoculture plots 88% and 96% of the plants wilted after three and five year cycles respectively. The pathogen's ability to survive without the presence of a host was demonstrated by the high wilt index recorded in the fallow plots (58% and 42%). After five years of maize monoculture 40% of potato plants wilted. Less wilting occurred in weed-fallowed plots (31% and 27%), even though some host species were present. Survival of this organism in the soil of all treatments exceeded the two-year period generally believed to be sufficient for eradication.
