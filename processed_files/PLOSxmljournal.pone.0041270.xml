Field studies did not involve endangered or protected species.In 2008 and 2009, half of the plots were irrigated with an amount equivalent to 28 l/m<sup>2</sup> evenly distributed in seven irrigation events along February and March, when most annual plants develop from the seedling stage and reach reproductive maturity. To minimize potential edge effects, a buffer of 20 cm around each plot was irrigated as well. Our irrigation treatment supposed a meaningful increase (more than the 50%) comparing with the natural rainfall recorded in the last 30 years for the same time lapse. With this treatment we aimed to remove potential constrains to the germination and development of annuals imposed by lack of water (abiotic filter). The 2010 spring was extremely rainy, 2.4 times rainier than the last 30 years for the same time lapse, so we did not conduct our irrigation treatment.Inverse Simpson â€Š=â€Š1/(âˆ‘P<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>).The values of Ï‡<sub>i</sub> evaluating the degree of association between the spatial patterns of richness and cover of both BSCs and annuals (four pair wise association indices) were also modeled by means of rm-GLM by considering microenvironment and irrigation as fixed factors.The autumn-spring period previous to the 2008 sampling was extremely dry; the total autumn precipitation was 79 mm/m<sup>2</sup>, from which 56 mm/m<sup>2</sup> fell in a single day. Winter and early spring were even drier, with only 38.5 mm/m<sup>2</sup> (hereafter called â€œthe dry yearâ€). On the contrary, the autumn previous to the 2009 sampling was significantly wetter (160.6 mm/m<sup>2</sup>) and followed by a dry winter (77.5 mm/m<sup>2</sup>; hereafter called â€œwet-dry yearâ€). In 2010, the opposite rainfall distribution happened, with a relatively dry autumn followed by a very wet winter (40.3 mm/m<sup>2</sup> and 343.6 mm/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively, hereafter called â€œdry-wet yearâ€).GLMs were performed assuming normal distributions of errors and with the identity link function.
