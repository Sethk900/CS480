Reproductive biology of Argenteohyla siemersi pederseni Williams and Bosso, 1994 (Anura: Hylidae) in northeastern ArgentinaThe present study describes the reproductive biology of Argenteohyla siemersi pederseni in a modified â€œquebrachoâ€ forest of Schinopsis balansae in northeastern Argentina. Observations were made between January 2007 and March 2009 at El PerichÃ³n, Corrientes Province, Argentina. Argenteohyla s. pederseni bred once per year over a 3-day period in a semi-permanent pond during the first spring rains in mid-September. Males called while floating on the water surface. The advertisement call was short and repeated at regular intervals in relatively fast succession, forming groups of multiple calls. Aggressive calls were evoked in two different agonistic interactions. Eggs were black, laid in three-dimensional arrangements interspersed within the submerged vegetation. Egg number per clutch ranged from 2638 to 8987. Tadpole redescription shows many differences and similarities with previous descriptions. The reproductive biology of A. s. pederseni has several similarities with another pond-dwelling casque-headed frog species.
