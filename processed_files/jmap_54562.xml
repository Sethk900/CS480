Phosphate saturation degree and accumulation of phosphate in various soil types in The NetherlandsObjective  The objective of this study is to quantify the potential risk of P leaching to groundwater in characteristic soil types in The Netherlands. In areas with shallow groundwater P losses via groundwater to surface waters is an important pathway.  Methods  The risk of P leaching to groundwater can be assessed by means of the phosphate saturation degree (PSD) methodology. The PSD is an index of the actual phosphate accumulation in the soil (Pact) in relation to the maximum phosphate sorption capacity (PSCm) of the soil to a reference depth. To assess the risk of P leaching the actual PSD of soils has to be compared to the critical PSD (PSDcrit) of the soil type. The critical PSD is determined for characteristic soil types based on phosphate sorption and desorption characteristics, and a reference depth (Lref) where a defined P concentration (Cp) in solution may not be exceeded. A stratified soil survey is used to determine the actual PSD of the soils.  Results  The critical phosphate saturation degree we determined for the main Dutch soil types varies from 5%–78%. The average P accumulation in agricultural soils in The Netherlands is about 2050 kg P ha− 1 (4700 kg P2O5 ha− 1) and the 5‰ and 95‰ are approximately 850 and 4500 kg P ha− 1. Since maize can tolerate high manure application rates, more phosphate has been applied on maize in the past, and high P accumulations are measured. In about 43% of the agricultural land in The Netherlands the critical PSD value for the given soil type is exceeded.
