The Role of White Clover in the Loss of Diversity in Grassland Habitat RestorationA field experiment was designed to recreate a species-rich mesotrophic grassland community of conservation worth. <em>Trifolium repens</em> (white clover) was observed to increase significantly in both frequency and abundance in sown plots grazed by cattle, but not in plots cut in June and subsequently grazed by cattle. In both these treatments permanent quadrats containing clover patches were found to be lower in species richness than were quadrats without clover. In both treatments botanical diversity was seen to decline over time. In the grazed-only treatment the loss of diversity may be linked to the increase in clover. In the cut and grazed plots, <em>T. repens</em> did not become so abundant but diversity was still seen to decline, possibly due to the loss of low growing species from the taller sward. A pot experiment which varied the sowing density of a mix of seven wild flower species in full factorial combination with cutting frequency was established on soils from an arable field also sown with a single density of clover. <em>T. repens</em> was seen to decline from initial high cover estimates in infrequently cut and uncut treatments. In the pot experiment where a grass component to the vegetation was absent, clover was seen to have less impact on the other forbs than it did in the field. It is suggested that, being a nitrogen fixer, <em>T. repens</em> may have a competitive edge in ex-arable soils low in available nitrogen. The observed reduction in botanical diversity may be a result of this increase in available nitrogen, facilitating the spread of the sown grasses and preventing the recovery of the sown forbs that were excluded by the invasion of <em>T. repens.</em> It is suggested that reducing the proportion of grass in the seed mixtures during grassland habitat creation on these soils may help reduce or delay this effect.
