 Conceived and designed the experiments: RDP RFL. Performed the experiments: RDP RFL. Contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools: RAS RDP RFL. Wrote the paper: RAS. Generated the idea that motivated the paper, analyzed and interpreted the data in the context of the research goals, and wrote the first version of the article: RAS. Designed the field study, collected the organisms, identified the species, generated the data, and contributed towards improving the manuscript: RDP RFL.  The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.  The temporal mean abundance was calculated for each species based on all sampling dates (n = 37). The upper line (a) is the He–Gaston model and the lower line (b) is the negative binomial model as parameterized for this data set.  Data set in Excel format.  (XLS)  We thank Sebastián P.
