Beziehungen zwischen den Bl√ºten einiger hochandiner Wollschopfpflanzen (Espeletiinae, Asteraceae) und InsektenThe flower heads of 8 species of the genus Espeletia MUTIS ex. H. et B. and of Espeleliopsis corymbosa (Espeletiinae, Asteraceae) which are abundant in the paramo region of the Eastern Andes of Colombia present a rich fauna of insects which stay there for long periods of time, some species completing their whole development there. Besides taxa which are encountered also in the flower heads of other Asteraceae adult stages of many other species are widespread and in part very abundant, for instance specimens of 5 families of Coleoptera and Bibionidae (Dilophus) on the heads of Espeletia grandiflora H. et B. The strategies on the part of the Espeletiinae, which regenerate only sexually, and on the part of the insects which must often compete in the tiny interior space of the heads are discussed. It is supposed that the high diversity of the insect cenosis has its source among others in the rich insect reserve of the mountain forest closely connected with the paramo, in the dominance of the Espeletiinae within the paramo vegetation and in the history of the propagation of this sub‚Ätribe since the late pliocene.
