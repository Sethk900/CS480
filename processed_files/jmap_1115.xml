Relationships Between Chihuahuan Desert Perennial Grass Production and Precipitation.Perennial grass production on the Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center in south-central New Mexico was correlated with precipitation characteristics over a 34-year period. Total December through September precipitation was highly correlated (r=+0.77, n=34) with perennial grass production. Practical generalized indices were developed that could be broadly applied by managers for predicting perennial grass production from precipitation characteristics. Perennial grass production and precipitation data on 3 separate pastures were collected over a 6-year period to evaluate the reliability of models to predict perennial grass production. Simple linear, 2-variable, quadratic, and polynomial regression models gave perennial grass production estimates that were well correlated with actual values (r=+0.85 to +0.91, n=17) across the 3 pastures. The quadratic regression model (Y=4.04âˆ’0.24X+0.012 X2, X=December through September precipitation, Y=forage production, n=34, r=0.85) g...
