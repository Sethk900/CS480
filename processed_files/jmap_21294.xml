New Coleoptera records from New Brunswick, Canada: EucnemidaeAbstract We report nine species of Eucnemidae new to the province and additional records for Onichodon canadensis (Brown) and Dromaeolus harringtoni Horn. Five species, Xylophilus cylindriformis (Horn), Entomophthalmus rufiolus (LeConte), Stethon pectorosus LeConte, Onichodon orchesides Newman, and Isarthrus rufipes (Melsheimer), are newly recorded for the Maritime provinces. This brings the total number of Eucnemidae recorded from New Brunswick to 15 species. Lindgren funnel traps are an effective tool for sampling the Eucnemidae.
