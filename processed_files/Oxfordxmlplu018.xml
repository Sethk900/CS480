However, changes in fluctuation in temperature, even if the mean temperature is the same, may affect plant growth. We tested the effects of weekly warm and then cool moderate (5°C) and large (10°C) fluctuation in temperature (with the same biweekly temperature sum) on plant growth. We found that, while the ratio of photosynthesis to respiration did not change, fluctuations in temperature did increase biomass accumulation and alter biomass allocation. Our findings suggest that, like mean temperature, fluctuation in temperature can significantly impact plant growth.Most investigations of plant responses to changes in temperature have focused on a constant increase in mean day/night temperature without considering how differences in temperature cycles can affect physiological processes and growth. To test the effects of changes in growth temperature on foliar carbon balance and plant growth, we repeatedly exposed poplar saplings (<italic>Populus deltoides</italic> × <italic>nigra</italic>) to temperature cycles consisting of 5 days of a moderate (M, +5 °C) or extreme (E, +10 °C) increase in temperature followed by 5 days of a moderate (M, −5 °C) or extreme (E, −10 °C) decrease in temperature, with respect to a control treatment (C, 23.4 °C). The temperature treatments had the same mean temperature over each warm and cool cycle and over the entire study. Our goal was to examine the influence of recurring temperature shifts on growth. Net photosynthesis (<italic>A</italic>) was relatively insensitive to changes in growth temperature (from 20 to 35 °C), suggesting a broad range of optimum temperature for photosynthesis. Leaf respiration (<italic>R</italic>) exhibited substantial acclimation to temperature, having nearly the same rate at 13 °C as at 33 °C. There was no evidence that preconditioning through temperature cycles affected the response of <italic>A</italic> or <italic>R</italic> to treatment temperature fluctuations. Averaged across the complete warm/cool temperature cycle, the <italic>A</italic> : <italic>R</italic> ratio did not differ among the temperature treatments. While foliar carbon balance was not affected, the temperature treatments significantly affected growth. Whole-plant biomass was 1.5 times greater in the M treatment relative to the C treatment. Carbon allocation was also affected with shoot volume and biomass greater in the M and E treatments than in the C treatment. Our findings indicate that temperature fluctuations can have important effects on growth, though there were few effects on leaf gas exchange, and can help explain differences in growth that are not correlated with mean growth temperature.Along with increases in mean global temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C31">Meehl <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>), global climate models predict future increases in the frequency and magnitude of sudden episodes of extreme temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C14">Coumou and Rahmstorf 2012</xref>). The increase in the frequency of heat waves observed in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C30">Meehl and Tebaldi 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C13">Chase <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C23">Gershunov <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>) exemplifies these expected temperature fluctuations. While there is a substantial body of information about the response of trees to changes in mean growth temperature (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C34">Sage and Kubien 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C39">Way and Oren 2010</xref>), the impact of variable temperature patterns on plant growth has been largely unexplored. A short-term shift to a higher temperature caused a change in growth in herbaceous communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C16">De Boeck <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C19">Dreesen <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>) and in foliar gas exchange of tree seedlings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C9">Bolstad <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C2">Ameye <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C8">Bauweraerts <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref> exposed <italic>Quercus rubra</italic> seedlings to repeated cycles of fluctuating temperatures, and observed significant decreases in gas exchange and total biomass due to the fluctuating temperatures.However, most studies have traditionally compared plant responses to differences in mean temperature. In many cases, tree biomass accumulation was positively correlated with mean growth temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C38">Usami <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C1">Allen and Vu 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C24">Ghannoum <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C39">Way and Oren 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C20">Duan <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>), though this response was not universal and some experiments reported no increase in biomass accumulation when mean growth temperature was increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C17">De Lucia <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C29">Maherali and DeLucia 2000</xref>). The conflicting effect of changes in temperature on plant biomass may be due, in part, to the variable effect changes in temperatures may have on foliar carbon balance. The effect of temperature on growth will most likely be determined by a combination of factors, including the thermal sensitivity of growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C5">Atkin <italic>et al.</italic> 2006<italic>a</italic></xref>), the temperature optimum for photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C43">Berry and Bjorkman 1980</xref>), the acclimation of respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C4">Atkin <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>) and, in some cases, the acclimation of photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C24">Ghannoum <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C26">Gunderson <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>).The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of repeated cycles of shifting temperatures on growth and physiology, independent of changes in mean temperature. We repeatedly exposed <italic>Populus deltoides</italic> × <italic>nigra</italic> saplings to temperature cycle treatments consisting of a 5-day period of a moderate (M, 5 °C) or extreme (E, 10 °C) temperature increase followed by a 5-day period of a moderate (M, 5 °C) or extreme (E, 10 °C) temperature decrease relative to a non-cycling control (C) treatment and compared volume growth, shoot and root biomass and leaf gas exchange. Plants in all three treatments were exposed to the same mean temperature over each cycle of warm and cool periods and over the entire growth period. In addition, a subset of control plants were exposed only once to the extreme temperature treatment to determine whether their physiological response would differ from that of plants repeatedly exposed. We tested the hypotheses that (i) growth will be reduced in the M and E temperature treatments compared with C; (ii) <italic>A</italic> will be affected much more than <italic>R</italic> by changes in temperature; and (iii) prior exposure to the warm and cool periods will alter the rates of <italic>A</italic> or <italic>R</italic> when plants are subsequently exposed to those conditions compared with plants not previously exposed.<italic>Populus deltoides</italic> × <italic>nigra</italic> cuttings (OP-36; Segal Ranch Hybrid Poplars, Grandview, WA, USA) were planted in 8-L pots in a potting medium (Nursery Mix; Conrad Fafard Inc., Agawam, MA, USA). Plants were grown in environment-controlled chambers (Model GC36; EGC Inc., Chagrin Falls, OH, USA) at The University of Georgia in Athens, GA, USA. The temperature (15 °C), relative humidity (70 %) and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR, 300 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) under a 12-h day/12-h night period were constant prior to treatment implementation.Air temperature (°C) regimes imposed during a complete cycle of 5-day warm and 5-day cool periods in the control treatment as well as the moderate (M) and extreme (E) temperature cycle treatments.At the beginning of the experiment, 22 plants were assigned to the C treatment, and 12 plants each were assigned to M and E treatments. To determine whether prior temperature conditions influenced the rates of <italic>A</italic> or <italic>R</italic>, a single-exposure temperature shift (S) treatment was also implemented, consisting of three plants from the C treatment that were transferred to the E treatment at the beginning of the third warm period and another three plants transferred to the E treatment at the beginning of the third cool period.Leaf gas exchange was measured during the third temperature cycle on plants in the three treatments (C, M and E + S). Net assimilation (<italic>A</italic>) and leaf dark respiration (<italic>R</italic>) were measured with a portable photosynthesis system in open path configuration (LI6400; Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE, USA) equipped with a blue–red LED light source (LI6400-02B) and a CO<sub>2</sub> injection system (LI6400-01). Net assimilation (<italic>A</italic>) was measured on one leaf per plant between 1000 and 1200 h on the first, third and fifth day of the warm and cool periods (which correspond to days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 of the temperature cycle; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU018F1">1</xref>). Measurements were conducted at chamber conditions (relative humidity: 50 %; [CO<sub>2</sub>]: 450 µmol mol<sup>−1</sup>; PAR: 300 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) and cuvette temperature was set to approximate air temperature in each chamber (i.e. 25.4, 30.4 and 35.4 °C during the warm period and 25.4, 20.4 and 15.4 °C during the cool period for C, M and E + S, respectively). Leaf <italic>R</italic> measurements were made in the dark using a similar protocol between 2000 and 2200 h on the same days. Cuvette temperature was set at 23.4, 28.4 and 33.4 °C during the warm period and 23.4, 18.4 and 13.4 °C during the cool period for C, M and E + S treatments, respectively.Measurements were repeated on five individual plants in each of the C, M and E treatments across the 12-day cycle. Repeated measurements were conducted on the same single leaf per plant over the entire cycle. For the S treatment, measurements were repeated on three plants during the warm period and three different plants during the cool period.The relationship between <italic>A</italic> and leaf internal CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (<italic>A</italic>/<italic>C</italic><sub>i</sub>) was measured on four plants per treatment at the end of both the warm and cool periods of the third cycle. For these measurements, plants were moved to a different growth chamber with similar light intensity and relative humidity of the treatment chambers, but temperature was maintained at 25 °C. Cuvette conditions were set to mimic chamber conditions, with the exception that measurements were made at saturating PAR (1200 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>). <italic>A</italic>/<italic>C</italic><sub>i</sub> curves started at 400 µmol mol<sup>−1</sup> CO<sub>2</sub> and ranged from 40 to 1000 µmol mol<sup>−1</sup> CO<sub>2</sub> in nine steps. The maximum rate of carboxylation (<italic>V<sub>c</sub></italic><sub>max</sub>) and photosynthetic electron transport (<italic>J</italic><sub>max</sub>) were determined with the A/<italic>C</italic><sub>i</sub> Curve Fitting Utility version 0.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C35">Sharkey <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>).Stem height and root collar diameter of each plant were measured at the end of each warm and cool period. Stem volume was calculated as the product of stem height and stem area at base. No branches developed on the stems during the study. Plants were harvested at the end of the fourth temperature cycle. The total leaf area of each plant was measured with a leaf area meter (LI 3100; Li-Cor Inc.). Biomass was separated into leaves, stem and roots, dried to constant mass at 70 °C, and weighed. Leaf area was divided by leaf weight to determine the specific leaf area (SLA) for each plant.One-way ANOVA was used to test mean treatment differences in <italic>A</italic>, <italic>R</italic>, <italic>g</italic><sub>s</sub> and <italic>A</italic> : <italic>R</italic> for each temperature period as well as to test treatment differences in <italic>V<sub>c</sub></italic><sub>max</sub> and <italic>J</italic><sub>max</sub>. The influence of prior exposure to recurring temperature cycles was tested by comparing means of the E and S treatments. A repeated-measures design was used to test treatment differences in stem volume throughout the observation period. Temperature treatment (C, M and E) was a fixed factor, day (<italic>n</italic> = 9) was the fixed repeated factor and individual plant (<italic>n</italic> = 12 for M and E; <italic>n</italic> = 16 for C) was the random subject factor. Differences in relative growth rate, calculated as (ln(mass2) − ln(mass1))/(DOY2 − DOY1), among and within treatments between the warm and cool period were tested by ANOVA. Biomass, total leaf area and SLA were analysed using a one-way ANOVA. Temperature treatment (C, M and E) was a fixed factor and individual plant (<italic>n</italic> = 12 for M and E; <italic>n</italic> = 16 for C) was a random factor. Linear and non-linear regression were used to plot the response of <italic>R</italic>, <italic>g</italic><sub>s</sub> and <italic>A</italic>, respectively, to leaf temperature. All analyses were performed using SAS (Version 9.1.3; SAS Inc., Cary, NC, USA) with a type-1 error rate of 0.05. Treatment means were compared using Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) test.Mean (A) leaf net photosynthesis (<italic>A</italic>) and (B) stomatal conductance (<italic>g</italic><sub>s</sub>) of poplar saplings measured at the mean temperature of the daily light period during a 5-day warm period (filled symbols) and a 5-day cool period (open symbols) for the C (circle), M (square), E (triangle) and S (diamond) treatments. Measurements of <italic>A</italic> and <italic>g</italic><sub>s</sub> were made on days 1, 3 and 5 of each warm and cool period and averaged across the period. Error bars are ±1 SEM. The curve represents best-fit non-linear regression (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.84).There was also no apparent effect of repeated temperature cycles on the response of <italic>A</italic> to the different treatment temperatures. Plants that were moved from the C treatment to the E treatment on the first day of the warm period and on the first day of the cool period (S treatment) did not have significantly different <italic>A</italic> when compared with plants that had been subjected to two previous complete cycles of warm and cool periods (compare E and S, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU018F2">2</xref>A) (warm period: <italic>P</italic> = 0.63; cool period: <italic>P</italic> = 0.63).Mean leaf dark respiration (<italic>R</italic>) of poplar saplings measured at the mean temperature of the daily dark period during a 5-day warm period (filled symbols) and a 5-day cool period (open symbols) for the C (circle), M (square), E (triangle) and S (diamond) treatments. Measurements of <italic>R</italic> were made on days 1, 3 and 5 of each warm and cool period and averaged across the period. Error bars are ±1 SEM. The line represents linear regression.The plants in the E and S treatments had nearly identical responses of <italic>R</italic> to temperature (warm period: <italic>P</italic> = 0.43; cool period: <italic>P</italic> = 0.70), suggesting that substantial temperature acclimation of <italic>R</italic> was not the result of preconditioning in previous temperature cycles.The ratio of net photosynthesis to respiration (<italic>A</italic> : <italic>R</italic>) of leaves.

Further, <italic>V<sub>c</sub></italic><sub>max</sub> and <italic>J</italic><sub>max</sub> remained similar between the warm and cool periods (<italic>P</italic> = 0.36 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.55, respectively). Averaged across treatments and periods, <italic>V<sub>c</sub></italic><sub>max</sub> was 74.58 ± 1.80 and <italic>J</italic><sub>max</sub> was 116.88 ± 3.02. <italic>V<sub>c</sub></italic><sub>max</sub> and <italic>J</italic><sub>max</sub> were also similar in the E and S treatments at the end of both the warm (<italic>P</italic> = 0.83 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.84, respectively) and cool (<italic>P</italic> = 0.35 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.93, respectively) periods.Mean ± SE leaf area, leaf dry mass and SLA of poplar saplings harvested at the conclusion of four recurring temperature cycles consisting of 5-day warm and 5-day cool periods with temperature shifts of 5 °C (M) or 10 °C (E) above and below control (C).

Error bars are ±1 SEM.One of the most important findings of this study was that growth was strongly affected by the temperature pattern to which the plants had been exposed. Growth did not simply correspond to the mean temperature or heat sum that the plants experienced during the growth period, since these were equal in the C, M and E treatments. Although we predicted that growth would be reduced in the M and E treatments relative to the C treatment (Hypothesis 1), those treatments actually increased growth. Of interest, the increase in biomass with fluctuating temperatures we report here was also accompanied by shifts in allocation. For instance, the E treatment caused a doubling in the root : shoot ratio, suggesting that fluctuations in temperature may alter growth rates and also affect biomass allocation patterns. These findings are especially relevant given the fact that fluctuations in ambient air temperatures in the past 20 years have become larger and have affected a greater land area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C27">Hansen <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). This suggests that broad correlations between biomass and mean temperature may be insufficient to accurately estimate plant growth.The response of <italic>A</italic> to temperature indicated a broad range of optimum temperature for <italic>A</italic> that was exceeded only at the lowest measurement temperature in the E treatment. This result provided little support for our second hypothesis that <italic>A</italic> would be more affected by temperature than <italic>R</italic>. Additionally, there was no difference among the C, M or E treatments in <italic>V<sub>c</sub></italic><sub>max</sub> or <italic>J</italic><sub>max</sub> measured at a common temperature, indicating that the treatments caused no permanent differences in photosynthetic capacity.In the same hybrid poplar genotype used in this study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C32">Ow <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> found no evidence of acclimation of <italic>A</italic> to different growth temperatures, which was consistent with the response we observed. A lack of acclimation of <italic>A</italic> to a change in growth temperature has been reported in other tree species (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C40">Wertin <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>), including other <italic>Populus</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C12">Centritto <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C18">Dillaway and Kruger 2011</xref>). However, there are also tree species that do exhibit thermal acclimation of <italic>A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C24">Ghannoum <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C26">Gunderson <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>).We observed acclimation of <italic>R</italic> to temperature, which was consistent with the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C32">Ow <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> in the same poplar genotype. By definition, full acclimation to temperature occurs when similar <italic>R</italic> is achieved under different temperature conditions, i.e. thermal homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C6">Atkin <italic>et al.</italic> 2006<italic>b</italic></xref>). In our study there were only small differences in <italic>R</italic> among treatments, indicating a substantial acclimation response, and near-thermal homeostasis across the wide range of measurement temperatures, from 33.4 °C in the warm period to 13.4 °C in the cool period in the E treatment.Even though there were ±5 and ±10 °C differences in temperature in the M and E treatments compared with C, the <italic>A</italic> to <italic>R</italic> ratio did not differ among the three treatments. This indicates that average foliar carbon balance was not significantly affected by the large fluctuations in temperature that were imposed in this study. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C6">Atkin <italic>et al.</italic> (2006<italic>b</italic>)</xref> reported that <italic>A</italic> : <italic>R</italic> for <italic>Plantago major</italic> and <italic>Plantago lanceolata</italic> was similar across a 20 °C range of temperature. In a series of temperature manipulations using various grasses and trees, including <italic>Eucalyptus delegatensis</italic> and <italic>E. dumosa</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C28">Loveys <italic>et al.</italic> (2003)</xref> reported a strong correspondence between <italic>A</italic> and <italic>R</italic> across a variety of growth temperatures, which they attributed to acclimation of both <italic>A</italic> and <italic>R</italic>. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C25">Gifford (1995)</xref> reported that <italic>A</italic> : <italic>R</italic> was extremely stable across a large range of temperatures if the plants were given adequate time to acclimate to the new growth temperature. However, in other studies <italic>A</italic> : <italic>R</italic> was sensitive to growth temperature. In <italic>Populus euramericana</italic>, <italic>A</italic> : <italic>R</italic> was greater in plants grown at 25 °C than at 35 °C, due mainly to a temperature-driven decline in <italic>A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C21">Fares <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). In contrast, <italic>A</italic> : <italic>R</italic> increased in <italic>Populus balsamifera</italic> with an increase in growth temperature, due mainly to the insensitivity of <italic>A</italic> to an increase in growth temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C36">Silim <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). While our findings support the conservation of <italic>A</italic> : <italic>R</italic> at different growth temperatures, this result could be influenced by the range of temperatures that the plants experience, and higher or lower temperatures beyond what were used in this study could alter the <italic>A</italic> : <italic>R</italic> ratio.Another interesting finding was the decoupling of biomass production and <italic>A</italic> : <italic>R</italic>. The similarity of <italic>A</italic> : <italic>R</italic> among treatments suggests that final biomass should be similar as well. However, both stem volume growth measured throughout the study and total accumulated biomass measured at the end of the study differed substantially among the treatments, and were greater in the M and E treatments compared with the C treatment. This result suggests different temperature sensitivities of biomass accumulation and leaf gas exchange. It is possible that the optimum temperature for growth is different from the optimum temperature for <italic>A</italic>, and plants in the M and E treatments may have been exposed to temperatures more ideal for biomass accumulation compared with plants in the C treatment. Calculations of RGR results offer some support for this idea. RGR in both the M and E treatments was greater in the cool period compared with the warm period. This increase in RGR during the cool period may be due to a decrease in whole-plant respiration, resulting in more carbohydrates available for biomass accumulation, or a shift to temperatures more favourable for biomass accumulation. Regardless, our results suggest that fluctuating temperatures can promote whole-plant growth. However, the exact mechanism that caused the increase in growth with temperature fluctuations is not known.Our results also indicate that carbon allocation in <italic>P. deltoides</italic> × <italic>nigra</italic> was sensitive to temperature. Sensitivity of carbon allocation to temperature appears to be present in some tree species but not in others. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C33">Pumpanen <italic>et al.</italic> (2012)</xref> found a lower root : shoot ratio in <italic>Betula pendula</italic> seedlings under low compared with high soil temperature, but no differences in <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> or <italic>Picea abies.</italic> An increase in temperature increased the root : shoot ratio in <italic>Pinus tabulaeformis</italic> but not in <italic>Picea asperata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C41">Zhao and Liu 2009</xref>), while other studies reported increases in seedling growth with increasing temperature but no effect on the root : shoot ratio in <italic>Pinus ponderosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C17">De Lucia <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>), <italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C42">Overdieck <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>) and <italic>P. asperata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C41">Zhao and Liu 2009</xref>).One final question we addressed was whether prior exposure to the temperature cycles would change the response of <italic>A</italic> or <italic>R</italic> to temperature (Hypothesis 3). At the time we made gas exchange measurements, the plants in the M and E treatments had been previously exposed to two full temperature cycles. We found no evidence that <italic>R</italic> responded differently in these plants compared with plants that had no prior exposure to temperature fluctuations (S treatment). This finding is in contrast with that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU018C32">Ow <italic>et al</italic>. (2008)</xref> in the same poplar clone, who found that full acclimation of <italic>R</italic> was observed only in leaves that emerged in the new temperature treatment. The reasons for differences in acclimation responses to temperature between these two studies are unclear. The question of whether the capacity for temperature acclimation of <italic>R</italic> in this species is an inherent characteristic of mature leaves or is dependent on the temperature exposure during leaf growth remains unresolved. We also found that <italic>A</italic> did not differ significantly between the E and S treatments, indicating that it was not altered by temperature acclimation, or stress, after exposure to repeated temperature cycles, compared with plants that had never been exposed to temperature shifts.In this study, volume and biomass growth increased in response to repeated cycles of fluctuating temperatures, even though there was little change in leaf respiration and net photosynthesis. The amplitude of the temperature shifts played an important role in the growth response of the plants. The greatest growth occurred in the moderate temperature treatment (M, ±5 °C). Aboveground growth increased in plants subjected to the extreme temperature treatment (E, ±10 °C), but not belowground growth or total biomass. The predicted response of trees to expected future changes in temperature is generally based on how they respond to increases in mean temperature without consideration of the possible effects of fluctuating temperatures or the magnitude of extreme events. Our results suggest that in addition to the influence of mean growth temperature, the amplitude of temperature shifts can have an important effect on growth, and this effect may not be predictable from measurements of leaf respiration and net photosynthesis.This work was supported by a grant from the <grant-sponsor id="cs1" rid="cn1" xlink:type="simple">United States Department of Energy NICCR Program</grant-sponsor> (Grant: <grant-num id="cn1" rid="cs1" xlink:type="simple">07-SC-NICCR-1060</grant-num>).
