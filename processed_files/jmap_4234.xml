               Species-habitat Association of the Spiny Rat,               Proechimys roberti               (Rodentia: Echimyidae), in the National Park of Brasília, DF, Brazil             Habitat association of the spiny rat, Proechimys roberti (Rodentia: Echimyidae), was studied in the National Park of Brasília from October 1998 to June 1999. Thirty-three captures and 25 individuals were recorded with an effort of 1907 trap-nights. Stepwise logistic regression revealed a significant positive association between the presence of babaçu palms and the probability of occurrence for P. roberti (p = 0.0006, df = 1). Stepwise multiple linear regression identified mean gallery forest width between sampling areas as a marginally significant variable in predicting capture success for this species (p = 0.056, df = 1). The results of this study suggest that P. roberti selects for specific microhabitats within the heterogeneous gallery forest environment.
