FRUITS, SEEDS AND GERMINATION IN FIVE SPECIES OF GLOBOSE CACTEAE (CACTACEAE)The morphological characteristics of fruits and seeds, and the germination responses of freshly matured seeds of five species of Cacteae (Coryphantha bumamma, C. clavata, C. cornifera, Ferocactus histrix and Mammillaria uncinata) were studied at room temperature under laboratory conditions. The aim of the study was to record the macro- and micro-morphology of fruits and seeds of these species and to investigate specific requirements for germination. Variance analysis detected significant differences (p<0.05) for several variables: number of seeds per fruit, weight, and fruit width. Larger fruits with more seeds are observed for F. histrix, whereas smaller fruits with less weight and fewer seeds are seen for C. clavata. Seed germination is a rapid process and usually starts on the third day. High percentages of germination (>80%) are observed on the sixth day in F. histrix and M. uncinata. It is concluded that some morphological characteristics of fruits and seeds can be used to support further systematic studies of Cactoideae genera and will contribute new knowledge for their potential use and conservation.
