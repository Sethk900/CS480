Evidence for the continued presence in New Zealand of Homotrysis macleayi (Borchmann, 1909) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae: Alleculinae)Abstract The first detailed specimen records are presented for the Australian beetle Homotrysis macleayi (Borchmann, 1909) in New Zealand. Evaluation of this evidence clearly indicates that the species is fully established in the wild in New Zealand. It is therefore recommended that the species be added to the New Zealand Organisms Register (NZOR), as exotic and present in the wild. Some general comments are offered on the importance of data and evidence in faunistics.
