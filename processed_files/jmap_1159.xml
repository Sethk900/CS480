Extent of Stem Dieback in Trembling Aspen (Populus Tremuloides) as an Indicator of Time-since Simulated Browsing.Simulated browsing treatments were imposed on an important browse species of the North American moose (Alces alces L.) to see if the development and extent of subsequent stem dieback in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) could be used to determine the time of browsing during the growing season. Two hundred naturally growing aspen saplings of similar size and form were randomly selected in a 20-ha area near the endowment lands of the University of Northern British Columbia, Prince George, British Columbia, Canada. Plants were randomly assigned to treatment categories so that the apical meristems of 50 plants each were assigned to a control or were clipped on one of the following dates 6 weeks apart: 1 June, 16 July, and 30 August 2005. The leader of each aspen was clipped and dieback was left to progress until the onset of winter dormancy. Our results showed that the earlier the simulated browsing occurs in the growing season, the greater the length of stem dieback, up to the maximum of ...
