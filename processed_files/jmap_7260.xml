A mimicry complex between mutillid wasps (Hymenoptera: Mutillidae) and spiders (Araneae)Mutillidae are a group of mainly tropical wasps with a rather similar warning colouration (MÃ¼llerian mimicry). Various groups, mainly spiders (Clubionidae, Salticidae, Gnaphosidae) are shown to be Batesian mimics of the mutillids. There is no complete similarity between model and mimic, the imitation of the â€œgeneral patternâ€; of a mutillid apparently provides enough protection.
