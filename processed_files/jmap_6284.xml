An evaluation of inoculation techniques inducing Stenocarpella maydis ear rot on maizeFour Stenocarpella maydis (Berk.) Sutton inoculation techniques were compared over two seasons at Potchefstroom and Bethlehem on six maize cultivars differing in ear rot susceptibility. The techniques showed differentiation between cultivar susceptibility. Application of a conidial suspension behind the ear resulted in significant correlation with the disease potentials over two seasons. Similarly, the technique of placing ground-infected kernels in the leaf whorl at three growth stages is recommended for evaluation of maize genotypes for resistance to maize ear rot.
