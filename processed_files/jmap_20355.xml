Projected effects of declining anthropogenic aerosols on the southern annular modeDeclining emissions of anthropogenic aerosols have been shown to contribute to global warming in climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). This study considers the response of the southern annular mode (SAM) in austral summer to declining aerosols in simulations forced by Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) using CSIRO-Mk3.6, a CMIP5-generation model. A ten-member ensemble forced by RCP4.5 for the period 2006â€“2100 is compared with another experiment, which is identical except that emissions of anthropogenic aerosols are held fixed at their 2005 values.  With fixed aerosol emissions, the model simulates a negative (but statistically insignificant) ensemble-mean SAM trend in austral summer, suggesting that the effects of recovering stratospheric ozone slightly outweigh the effects of increasing long-lived greenhouse gases (GHGs). In contrast, the standard RCP4.5 experiment (including additional warming due to declining aerosols) simulates a positive ensemble-mean SAM trend, and the difference between the two trends is significant at 5%. The response of Southern Hemisphere zonal-mean atmospheric circulation and temperature to declining aerosols resembles the response to increasing GHGs; this suggests that the positive SAM trend due to declining aerosols may be driven by mechanisms that are similar to those that cause the positive SAM trend in response to increasing GHGs.
