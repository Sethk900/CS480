Movements and Radionuclide Concentrations of Sage Grouse in Southeastern IdahoMovements and radionuclide concentrations of sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) sum- mering near nuclear facilities on the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory in southeastern Idaho were studied from 1977 through 1980. From 10 July through 7 September, 95% of all locations (N = 131) of radio- marked grouse were within 2 km of their feeding areas on lawns surrounding the facilities. During October and November, 82% of all radiolocations (N = 22) were greater than 2 km from these areas. The maximum 1-way movement to winter range was 81 km. Radionuclide concentrations (primarily radiocesium) were higher (P = 0.05) in sage grouse summering near a facility with liquid radioactive waste storage than in grouse summering near a solid radioactive waste disposal area or in control areas. The short biological half- life of the ingested radionuclides and the timing of sage grouse movements from summering areas reduced any potential radiation dose to a person consuming 1 of these birds
