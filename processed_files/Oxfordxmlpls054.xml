Shoot multiplication was achieved by repeated transfer of mother explants and subculturing of <italic>in vitro</italic> produced shoot clumps on MS medium supplemented with various concentrations of BAP alone or in combination with auxin (IAA or NAA). <italic>In vitro</italic> raised shoots were rooted under <italic>ex vitro</italic> condition. Genetic fidelity of the regenerated plants was assessed using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD).<italic>Celastrus paniculatus</italic>, belonging to the family Celastraceae, is an important medicinal plant of India. Owing to the ever-increasing demand from the pharmaceutical industry, the species is being overexploited, thereby threatening its stock in the wild. Poor seed viability coupled with low germination restricts its propagation through sexual means. Thus, alternative approaches such as <italic>in vitro</italic> techniques are highly desirable for large-scale propagation of this medicinally important plant. Nodal segments, obtained from a 12-year-old mature plant, were used as explants for multiple shoot induction. Shoot multiplication was achieved by repeated transfer of mother explants and subculturing of <italic>in vitro</italic> produced shoot clumps on Murashige and Skoog's (MS) medium supplemented with various concentrations of 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) alone or in combination with auxin (indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) or α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA)). The maximum number of shoots (47.75 ± 2.58) was observed on MS medium supplemented with BAP (0.5 mg L<sup>−1</sup>) and IAA (0.1 mg L<sup>−1</sup>). <italic>In vitro</italic> raised shoots were rooted under <italic>ex vitro</italic> conditions after treating them with indole-3-butyric acid (300 mg L<sup>−1</sup>) for 3 min. Over 95 % of plantlets acclimatized successfully. The genetic fidelity of the regenerated plants was assessed using random amplified polymorphic DNA. No polymorphism was detected in regenerated plants and the mother plant, revealing the genetic fidelity of the <italic>in vitro</italic> raised plantlets. The protocol discussed could be effectively employed for large-scale multiplication of <italic>C. paniculatus</italic>. Its commercial application could be realized for the large-scale multiplication and supply to the State Forest Department.<italic>Celastrus paniculatus</italic> (known as <italic>Jyotishmati</italic> in Sanskrit and <italic>Malkangni</italic> in Hindi), belonging to the family Celastraceae, is an important medicinal plant of India. Oil obtained from the seeds of this plant is a source of herbal medicine, which is used in the treatment of gout, leprosy, skin diseases, fever, rheumatism, beriberi, sores and neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS054C36">Warrier <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS054C10">Lal and Singh 2010</xref>). Celapagin, celapanigin, celapanin, celastrine and paniculatine are the alkaloids found in the seed oil which are responsible for making the plant medicinally highly potent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS054C14">Parimala <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Several studies have confirmed the memory- and grasping-power-boosting properties of <italic>C. paniculatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS054C13">Nair and Seeni 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS054C8">Godkar <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). Apart from these therapeutic applications, its roots are also used in the treatment of cancerous tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS054C15">Parotta 2001</xref>).Conventionally, <italic>C. paniculatus</italic> is propagated mainly through the seeds. However, the viability and germination (11.5 %) of the seeds are poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS054C27">Rekha <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Increasing human and livestock populations have affected the status of wild plants, particularly those used in medicines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS054C33">Singh <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Owing to its pharmaceutical importance, this species has been overexploited and is now considered a threatened species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS054C11">Martin <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS054C10">Lal and Singh 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS054C23">Raju and Prasad 2010</xref>). Thus, there is an urgent need to conserve the natural stock and multiply the plants on a larger scale to reduce the dependence on the forests for the supply of raw drugs. In the past three to four decades, plant tissue culture has been exploited as a valuable tool for the conservation and large-scale propagation of medicinally important and endangered plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS054C17">Phulwaria <italic>et al.</italic> 2012<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS054C19">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS054C35">Thiyagarajan and Venkatachalam 2012</xref>). However, the influence of culture conditions, for instance, culture media, type of explant, successive transfer of culture, temperature, pH, etc., leads to genomic changes in the <italic>in vitro</italic> raised plantlets. Thus, analysis of the genetic homogeneity of tissue culture raised plants is a prerequisite for their exploitation on a commercial scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS054C20">Rai, M. K. <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). DNA-based molecular markers are powerful tools for analysis of the genetic fidelity of micropropagated plantlets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS054C2">Ahmad and Anis 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS054C31">Sharma <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>).The present paper concerns an improved and reproducible protocol for large-scale propagation of <italic>C. paniculatus.</italic> The multiplication rate achieved in the present investigation is better than that in earlier reports on the same taxon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS054C13">Nair and Seeni 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS054C4">Arya <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS054C30">Sharada <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS054C11">Martin <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS054C26">Rao and Purohit 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS054C22">Raju and Prasad 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS054C10">Lal and Singh 2010</xref>). To save time and reduce labour cost, efforts were also made to optimize the most favourable conditions for <italic>ex vitro</italic> rooting. Furthermore, to confirm the genetic fidelity, regenerated plants underwent molecular analysis using DNA-based molecular markers.An approximately 12-year-old plant of <italic>C. paniculatus</italic>, maintained in the field of the Biotechnology Unit, JNV University, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India, was used as the mother plant to collect the explants. Juvenile shoots obtained from freshly emerged sprouts were collected and nodal segments (3–5 cm) were excised. Prior to surface sterilization using 0.1 % (w/v) HgCl<sub>2</sub> (Hi-Media, India) for 5 min under aseptic conditions, explants were treated with 0.1 % (w/v) Bavistin (BASF India Limited, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India) for 5–7 min to reduce the chance of fungal contamination. Explants (2–3 cm) were finally rinsed (5–6 times) with sterile double-distilled water to remove any traces of the disinfectant.Murashige and Skoog's (MS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS054C12">Murashige and Skoog 1962</xref>) medium supplemented with sucrose (3 %) and additives (50 mg L<sup>−1</sup> ascorbic acid, 25 mg L<sup>−1</sup> adenine sulfate, 25 mg L<sup>−1</sup> arginine and 25 mg L<sup>−1</sup> citric acid), as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS054C4">Arya <italic>et al.</italic> (2002</xref>), was used for culture initiation. Agar-agar (Hi-Media, India) was added to the culture media as a gelling agent at a concentration of 0.8 % (w/v). The pH of the medium was adjusted to 5.8 ± 0.02 and the medium was then autoclaved for 15 min at 121 °C. Cultures were maintained at 28 ± 2 °C under a 14 h day<sup>−1</sup> photoperiod with a light intensity of 40–50 µmol m<sup>−2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> photon flux density, provided using cool white fluorescent lamps (Philips, India).To study the effect of plant growth regulators (PGRs) on bud break, nodal explants were cultured on MS medium containing different kinds (6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) or kinetin (Kin)) and concentrations (0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 or 5.0 mg L<sup>−1</sup>) of cytokinins. Cultures showing bud break were further multiplied using two approaches: (i) <italic>in vitro</italic> produced axillary shoots were excised and the mother explants were transferred repetitively for four passages (at 3-week intervals) onto MS medium containing 1.0 mg L<sup>−1</sup> BAP plus additives; and (ii) shoot clumps (each containing 4–5 shoots) were excised from mother cultures and transferred onto MS medium containing BAP alone (0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 mg L<sup>−1</sup>) or a combination of an optimized concentration of BAP (0.5 mg L<sup>−1</sup>) with different concentrations (0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 or 0.3 mg L<sup>−1</sup>) of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) or α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) for shoot multiplication and elongation.To induce roots under <italic>ex vitro</italic> conditions, shoots (5–8 cm long) were excised from <italic>in vitro</italic> developed multiple shoots and the basal ends were treated with different concentrations (0.0, 100, 200, 300, 400 or 500 mg L<sup>−1</sup>) of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) or NAA for 3 min. The treated shoots were transferred to bottles containing sterile soil-rite (a mixture of horticulture-grade perlite with Irish peat-moss and exfoliated vermiculite; supplied by Kel Perlite, Bangalore, Karnataka, India) moistened with an aqueous solution of one-quarter strength of MS basal salts. These bottles were kept in the greenhouse near the pad section in order to maintain high relative humidity (80–90 %) and low-temperature conditions (28 ± 2 °C).After root initiation, the caps of bottles were gradually opened over a period of 2 weeks and finally removed. Bottles containing plantlets were then shifted from the pad section towards the fan section to provide growing conditions of low humidity (60–70 %) and high temperature (32 ± 2 °C). After 4–5 weeks, acclimatized plantlets were transferred to poly-bags containing a mixture of organic manure, clay and sand (1 : 1 : 1). Such plantlets were kept in the greenhouse for 7–8 weeks, shifted to the nursery and finally transferred to the field for the evaluation of percentage survival of plants.The genetic stability of the 13 randomly selected <italic>in vitro</italic> regenerated plants was assessed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted from the fresh juvenile leaves of the mother plant and <italic>in vitro</italic> regenerated plants by following the cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS054C7">Doyle and Doyle 1990</xref>). Extracted DNA was quantified using a UV–Visible Elico spectrophotometer and the quality of DNA was tested following electrophoresis on a 0.8 % agarose gel. After preliminary screening of 25 primers, 16 RAPD primers were selected for genetic fidelity of tissue culture raised plants (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLS054TB4">4</xref>). The PCR was performed in a 15 µL reaction mixture containing 2.0 µL of template DNA (50–60 ng), 1.5 µL of 10× PCR buffer (Bangalore Genei, Bangalore, Karnataka, India), 1.5 µL of MgCl<sub>2</sub> (2.5 mM; Bangalore Genei), 0.3 µL of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (10 mM; Bangalore Genei), 0.8 µL of random primer (10 µM; Integrated DNA Technologies Inc., India), 0.5 µL of three unit Taq polymerase (Bangalore Genei) and 8.6 µL of sterile distilled water. DNA amplification was carried out in a thermal cycler (Eppendorf 5331, Germany). The PCR programme consisted of an initial denaturation for 4 min at 94 °C, then 40 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 94 °C, 1.20 min annealing at <italic>T</italic><sub>a</sub> °C and 1.30 min extension at 72 °C with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The annealing temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>a</sub>) was kept at 2 °C below the melting temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>) of that particular primer sequence. Amplification with each primer was repeated twice to confirm the reproducibility of the results. The amplification products for all samples were resolved on a 1.4 % agarose (A9539; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) gel using 1× Tris/borate/EDTA buffer and stained with ethidium bromide (0.25 µg mL<sup>−1</sup>). Gels were visualized using a gel documentation system (Syngene Gel Doc; Syngene, Synoptics Ltd, UK). The size of the amplicons was estimated by comparison with a 100-bp DNA ladder (Bangalore Genei).All the experiments were conducted with a minimum of 20 replicates per treatment. Each explant was taken as a replication and all the experiments were repeated three times. The results were expressed as the mean ± SD for all experiments. The data were subjected to statistical analysis using one-way analysis of variance, and the significance between means was assessed by Duncan's multiple range test (DMRT) at <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05.Effect of cytokinins (BAP or Kin) on multiple shoot induction from nodal explants of <italic>C. paniculatus</italic>.Means in each column followed by the same superscript letters are not significantly different according to DMRT at <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05.<bold>Micropropagation of <italic>C. paniculatus</italic>.</bold> (A) Nodal explants showing bud break on MS medium containing 2.0 mg L<sup>−1</sup> BAP after 1–2 weeks of culture.

Continuous supply of plants through micropropagation would reduce the pressure on the species' natural population and thus help conserve it. The technique of inducing roots under <italic>ex vitro</italic> conditions has made the discussed protocol more efficient and economical owing to the improved survival. Apart from being rapid, the protocol was found to cause no genetic variation among the regenerants and hence could be of great practical utility.The work was funded by the <grant-sponsor xlink:type="simple">University Grants Commission (UGC), New Delhi</grant-sponsor>, through a Post Doctoral Fellowship and Dr D.S.
