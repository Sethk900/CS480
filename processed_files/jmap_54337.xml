Origin of cristobalite in soils derived from volcanic ash in temperate and tropical regionsCristobalite was isolated from four Ando soils and a Podzolic soil developed on volcanic ashes in French West Indies, Indonesia and Japan by selective chemical dissolution with 6 M HCl, 0.5 M NaOH and H2SiF6 treatments followed by specific gravity separation. All the cristobalite isolates give X-ray diffractograms with a strong and sharp peak at 4.10–4.11 Å and associated peaks at 2.8 and 2.5 Å, which are characteristic for cristobalite of high-temperature origin. Four out of five isolates show a peak at 4.06–4.07 Å ascribed to low-temperature cristobalite. The oxygen isotopic ratios (δ18OSMOW) of cristobalite isolates show a range of +5.3 to +11.0%. which suggests a high-temperature igneous origin. These X-ray diffraction and oxygen isotopic data indicate that the cristobalite was inherited from primary volcanic ash rather than formed during pedogenesis.
