Enzymatic activity in an airfield soil polluted with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbonsThe relation between the content of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and enzymatic activity (dehydrogenase, phosphatase, urease and protease) was evaluated in soils collected from the area of a military airfield in DÄ™blin (SE Poland). Soils subjected to spot pollution sources as well as scattered pollution were analysed. It may be concluded that the influence of PAHs on the enzymatic activity depends to a significant level on soil properties like total organic carbon (TOC) content and pH. For some samples, a stimulating influence of PAH on dehydrogenase activity and biochemical potential fertility indicator was shown, which was attributed to an adaptation of the soil microflora and the use of the pollutant as a C and energy source.
