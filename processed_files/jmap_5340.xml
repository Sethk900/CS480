On some Maerid genera (Crustacea, Amphipoda, Maeridae) collected by the Hourglass Cruises (Florida). Part 1: Genera Anamaera, Ceradocus, Clessidra gen. nov., Jerbarnia, Maera, Meximaera, with a key to world CeradocusThis paper deals with some of the Amphipoda Maeridae, i.e. seven species in the genera Anamaera, Ceradocus, Clessidra gen. nov., Jerbarnia, Maera and Meximaera, collected during the Hourglass cruises, a 28-month sampling programme at 10 stations (5–73 m depth) on the central West Florida shelf. A new genus Clessidra is erected for Maera tinkerensis Kunkel, and Maera caroliniana Bynum and Fox is found to be a junior synonym of Meximaera diffidentia. Keys to these Atlantic maerids, and to world Ceradocus species, are provided.
