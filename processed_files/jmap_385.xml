Universal Trap Timer Design to Examine Temporal Activity of Wildlife.We designed a reliable and inexpensive universal trap timer that records the time from the moment a single-live-capture trap is triggered by an animal to when the observer checks the trap. Combined with trapping information, the diel activity pattern of a given species or demographic group can then be described or compared between imposed treatments. The universal trap timer is adaptable to operate reliably with most single-capture trap designs, requires no permanent modification of traps, and is easy to construct.
