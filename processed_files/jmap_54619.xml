Dissolution features of gold particles in a lateritic profile at Dondo Mobi, GabonThis paper describes the morphological evolution of gold particles in a lateritic weathering profile under rain forest. Inherited from primary quartz veins associated with amphibolite, the gold particles can be recognized from the weathering front up through the saprolite and overlying regolith to the land surface in the central part of the supergene gold dispersion halo. Gold particles undergo some changes in the uppermost 10 m. Voids and corrosion pits appear on particle surfaces; their numbers and sizes increase toward the land surface. Edges of particles become progressively more blunt from the bottom to the top of the section. The morphological changes are attributed to dissolution of gold over time. Possible causes for such dissolution are discussed. Occurrence of gold particles in the soil could be helpful for gold explorations in the humid tropics.
