Drought-related protein synthesis in cottonThe changes in protein profiles of six cotton cultivars subjected to osmotic stress were examined. Osmotic stress was applied by incubating leaf segments in mannitol. The efficiency of protein synthesis decreased with increasing concentrations of mannitol. Drought-related protein synthesis during osmotic stress was found in the cultivars Lido, Delta Pine, Acala 1517â€“70 and OR3, while drought-related proteins were not observed in the cultivars Selati and Letaba. It would: appear that drought-related protein synthesis was cultivar specific.
