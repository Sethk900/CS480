Effect of gut passage and dung on seed germination and seedling growth: donkeys and a multipurpose mesquite from a Mexican inter-tropical desertWe address the idea that donkeyâ€™s gut passage and dung could increase seed germination and seedling growth of Prosopis laevigata. This species is a useful plant in a Mexican inter-tropical desert, where land use change and habitat fragmentation are currently affecting P. laevigata shrublands. We conducted greenhouse experiments in which seeds ingested by donkeys and non-ingested seeds were placed in dung pats or soil. Results suggested that gut passage and dung did not have signiï¬cant effects on seed germination. On the other hand, dung signiï¬cantly increased the height and dry weight of P. laevigata seedlings. Information about the effects of donkeys on seedling establishment could be used to promote the natural regeneration of this plant species.
