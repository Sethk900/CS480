Simulation of the Streamflow for the Rio Nuevo Watershed of Jamaica for Use in Agriculture Water Scarcity PlanningAbstractJamaica’s water resources are under increasing risk of degradation and depletion, especially in light of increasing population growth, urbanization, and climate change. In this study, the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) was used to simulate the hydrologic characteristics of the Rio Nuevo watershed in Jamaica to assess streamflow availability for irrigation supply during dry periods. Approximately 85% of the watershed consists of aquiclude rock material, thus resulting in low potential for interaction between surface and groundwater. Historical climatic data (precipitation and temperature) were obtained for the watershed, and streamflow data were obtained for the Rio Nuevo, which drains the watershed. The model was calibrated over the period 2002–2004, and validated using the period 2005–2007. This paper outlines the parameterization of SWAT for the Rio Nuevo watershed and describes the potential for its use in agricultural water scarcity management in Jamaica. A Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) coefficient of 0.76 was obtained for calibration, whereas a coefficient of 0.50 was obtained for validation. Results indicate that in drought periods, the stream cannot supply the necessary water needed for the agricultural areas.
