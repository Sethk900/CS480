Two new species of Pogonognathellus (Collembola: Tomoceridae) from China, with a discussion of East Asian speciesThirteen species of the genus Pogonognathellus Paclt, 1944 have been reported worldwide, two from East Asia. Two new species of the genus from Jilin Province, northeast China are described here. Pogonognathellus heterochros sp. nov. is characterized by its unique body colour. Pogonognathellus mai sp. nov. is most similar to Pogonognathellus beckeri (BÃ¶rner, 1909) but differs from it mainly in maxilla and tenaculum. A key to the East Asian species is provided, and the confusion among these species is discussed. http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:902CD044-0A58-4CCF-A1B1-449C9DE10938
