Groundwater Geochemical Characterization of a Fuel-Contaminated Fractured Bedrock in a Permafrost EnvironmentAbstractRemediation of a contaminated site to site-specific cleanup standard requires a good understanding of the geochemical characteristics of the site. In this study, the groundwater hydrochemical characteristics of a fuel-contaminated mine site in the Northwest Territories (Canada) was evaluated to understand the active geochemical processes and assess the groundwater quality in comparison to guidelines for the protection of freshwater aquatic life. Groundwater samples were taken from installed monitoring wells across the site and analyzed by field and laboratory methods for dissolved metals; ions; and benzene, toulene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) organic constituents. The results showed that the groundwater is Ca-SO4 type because of ubiquitous occurrence of gypsum dissolution and carbonate weathering. The last sampling at the site showed that the BTEX constituents of interest were above the guideline limits in some locations, but other geochemical indicators showed biodegradation is occurring at the site. The inorganic parameters of interest were generally less than the limits studied with few outliers except iron, aluminum, and nickel. Iron and aluminum have background concentrations above the studied limits. This study underscores the importance of mineralogical composition of the native bedrock on groundwater geochemical processes.
