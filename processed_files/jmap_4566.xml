The delta yield procedure for nitrogen fertilisation of maize in South AfricaThe nitrogen fertilisation requirement for maize in South Africa is generaly estimated through the optimum yield-nitrogen rate procedure. The efficacy of this procedure is questionable. Delta yield, the difference between the maize grain yield at the economic optimum and that of a zero nitrogen fertilised control, was investigated for its ability to estimate the economically optimum nitrogen fertilisation rate for the South African maize producing area. Data from 124 locality-year fertilisation trials scattered over this area were used for the analyses. As in North America, optimum nitrogen rate correlated better with delta yield (R2 = 0.66) than with optimum yield (R2 = 0.51). Consequently, it shows potential to be a trustworthier predictor of the nitrogen fertilisation requirement of maize than the traditional optimum yield-nitrogen rate procedure. The delta yield model (Y = X0.602 where Y is the amount of fertiliser nitrogen and X delta yield, both measured in kg haâˆ’1) was not only uniform for different soil and climatic regions in South Africa, but appears to be similar to that found for five states of the USA.
