Synopsis of Poeciloderrhis Stål, 1874, with the description of three new species, and a redescription of the male and female of Poeciloderrhis ferruginea (Brunner von Wattenwyl, 1865) from southeast Brazil (Blattodea, Blaberidae, Epilamprinae)Poeciloderrhis Stål (1874) was first described without reference to the included species and without morphological details. The genus was described in a key for the American Epilampra, which left only Asian-Australian species in the genus. Roth (1970) was the first to separate Poeciloderrhis from Epilampra with strong morphological characters. In this contribution, three species of Poeciloderrhis are described and a new record from Minas Gerais State is added. The genitalia of the female of P. ferruginea are described for the first time. The genital plates were removed after dissection of the posterior part of the abdomen of males and females, using traditional dissection techniques. The parts were dissected on slides containing glycerin for examination under the stereoscopic microscope. Habitus images, and images of the pronotum, head and genitals were obtained with the help of a camera coupled to a stereomicroscope. The studied material is stored in glycerin inside microvials, and is deposited in the collection of the Museu Nacional. Three new species, P. caracensis sp. n., P. minoris sp. n. and P. tijucana sp. n. are described and compared with the holotypes of previously described species, together with a redescription of the male and female of P. ferruginea (Brunner von Wattenwyl, 1865).
