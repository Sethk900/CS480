Effect of gravity on the quality of witloof chicory (Cichorium intybus L.)In order to establish the effect of gravity on chicon quality and yield, witloof chicory roots were forced at three angles. It was shown that roots forced in a horizontal position produced a significantly lower marketable chicon yield than roots forced in a vertical position or at an angle of 45Â°. This reduced yield was brought about by an increased fall-out percentage where chicons were grown from roots placed at an angle.
