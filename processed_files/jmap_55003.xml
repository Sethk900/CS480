Integration of INS, GPS, Magnetometer and Barometer for Improving Accuracy Navigation of the VehicleThis paper describes integrated navigation system that is based on a low cost inertial sensor, global positioning system (GPS) receiver, magnetometer and a barometer, in order to improve accuracy of complete attitude and navigation solution. The main advantage of integration consists in availability of reliable navigation parameters during the intervals of absence of GPS data. The magnetometer and the barometer are applied for the attitude calibration and vertical channel stabilization, respectively. The acceptable accuracy of inertial navigation system (INS) is achieved by the proper damping of INS errors. The integration is made by the implementation of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) with control signal that is designed appropriate for low accuracy sensors noise characteristics. The analysis of integrated navigation system performances is made experimentally and the results show that integrated navigation system provides continuous and reliable navigation solutions.
