On the Monacha species of Lebanon (Gastropoda, Hygromiidae)Abstract In this paper, all seven hitherto known species of the hygromiid genus Monacha from Lebanon are briefly characterised and illustrated, and distribution maps are supplied (Monacha (Monacha) syriaca (Ehrenberg, 1831), Monacha (Monacha) nummus (Ehrenberg, 1831), Monacha (Monacha) obstructa (L. Pfeiffer, 1842), Monacha (Monacha) crispulata (Mousson, 1861), Monacha (Monacha) solitudinis (Bourguignat, 1852), Monacha (Monacha) bari Forcart 1981, and Monacha (Monacha) cf. compingtae (Pallary, 1929)). One species, Monacha (Monacha) bari Forcart, 1981, is recorded for the country for the first time, and its relationship to Monacha (Monacha) compingtae (Pallary, 1929) is discussed. Based on recently collected specimens, the genital organs of a long time ignored species, Helix solitudinis Bourguignat, 1852 could be investigated. It is here re-described as a Monacha species endemic for Lebanon.
