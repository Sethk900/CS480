Distinguishing Bolboceras inaequale Westwood, 1848 and two new relatives from India (Coleoptera, Geotrupidae, Bolboceratinae)Abstract The taxonomy of the Bolboceras inaequale group of species is discussed. The group as here conceived comprises three species in the Indian subcontinent: Bolboceras inaequale Westwood, 1848 (reputedly also ranging into sub-Saharan Africa), and two new species: Bolboceras duplicatum, and Bolboceras orissicum, both from India. All three are keyed, diagnosed, and illustrated; variability and potential taxonomic obstacles are briefly discussed.
