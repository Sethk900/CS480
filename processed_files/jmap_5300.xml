Clues supporting photoperiod as the main determinant of seasonal variation in amphibian activityOrganism survival and reproduction are affected by the ability to synchronize behaviour and physiological condition to the season, typically using photoperiod. However, temperature and rainfall have been repeatedly invoked as determinants of annual reproductive cycles in amphibians. This putative role of environmental conditions determining amphibians' activity was recently challenged in favour of photoperiod or a combination of environmental variables as more plausible clues. We evaluated the alternative variables potentially used by amphibians to track season fluctuations. The seasonality of a system was captured in a structural equation model, which identified photoperiod as the variable that represents seasonal variations in amphibian richness and climatic conditions. Congruently, reconstruction of amphibian seasonality with a sinusoidal model captured the same information as a linear regression between richness and photoperiod. Available evidence suggests that amphibians could be tracking photoperiod, over temperature and rainfall, as the proximate factor determining their seasonal variation in physiology and activity.
