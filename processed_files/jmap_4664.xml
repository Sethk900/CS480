Genotype-environment interactions and yield stability analyses of maize in EthiopiaThe objective of this study was to evaluate the adaptation of 10 maize genotypes across five locations and three years in Ethiopia. Grain yield of 10 maize genotypes, tested in a randomised block design with four replications across the named environments, was analysed using different stability models. Year by location and location variability were the dominant sources of interaction. The stability analyses identified BH-660, Gibe-1 and E1 as the more stable genotypes, while Kulani, BH-140 and E5 were adapted to specific environments. The stability analyses indicated that Wricke's ecovalence, Shukla's stability variance and AMMI stability values showed close similarity and effectiveness in detecting stable genotypes over a range of environments.
