Spatial characterization of megabenthic epifauna of soft bottoms around mud volcanoes in the Gulf of CádizThe structure and composition of megabenthic epifauna from the mud volcano field known as El Laberinto and the nearby soft bottoms were analysed. Species abundance and biomass data were obtained from the Arrastre Región Sur-Atlántica bottom trawl surveys carried out routinely from 1993 to 2009. A high biodiversity of megabenthic epifauna was found with a total of 272 species. Univariate community descriptors displayed similar values in zones inside and outside El Laberinto and in different seasons with the exception of abundance, which was larger in the autumn, especially in the zone nearest the mud volcano field. The dominant species in terms of abundance in all zones were similar and included Pasiphaea sivado, Plesionika martia, Parapenaeus longirostris, Nezumia aequalis, Chimaera monstrosa, Galeus melastomus and Etmopterus spinax. This information could be useful for increasing knowledge on biodiversity and the occurrence of commercial species and for establishing conservation strategies for protection of mud volcanoes within El Laberinto, and also including the surrounding seafloor to reduce the impact of trawl fisheries within the mud volcano field.
