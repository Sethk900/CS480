Community properties of benthic molluscs as indicators of environmental stress induced by organic enrichmentThis study investigates the multivariate spatioâ€temporal population patterns of molluscan taxocoenosis along an organic load gradient caused by the presence of a fish farm unit in the semiâ€enclosed microâ€tidal Gera bay in the island of Lesvos (northeast Aegean), by exploring three different properties (species abundance, trophic web structure and geographic ranges) as indicators for detecting community disturbance. Results have shown that community properties related to ecosystem functioning (i.e. food web analysis) and macroâ€ecological aspects (i.e. zoogeographical orientation community features) have proved to be more sensitive in detecting the effects of organic load perturbation than species abundance, thus indicating the use of such properties in environmental assessment approaches in the future.
