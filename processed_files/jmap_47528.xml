Twig morphology effects on the number of egg incisions and reproductive success of Oncideres ocularis (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae)The objective of this study was to analyze whether the morphology of girdled twigs has an effect on the number of incisions and the reproductive success of Oncideres ocularis (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae). Eight parameters of girdled branches were evaluated. Surface area showed the highest coefficient of determination for the number of eggs laid per branch and for the number of hatched larvae. Surface area, volume and length of girdled branches correlated significantly with the number of laid eggs and hatched larvae, as has been reported for similar insects.
