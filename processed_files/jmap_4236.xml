Nest Architecture of Atta laevigata (F. Smith, 1858) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)The internal structure of three nests of Atta laevigata was studied in Botucatu city, SÃ£o Paulo State, Brazil. Two nests were excavated through the opening of trenches and one was cement-moulded to enable a better view of the internal structures. The three nests presented a similar structure, with the depths and number of chambers varying as a function of the loose soil area of the nests. The number of chambers ranged from 1149 to 7864, reaching as deep as 7 m underground. Chamber volume ranged from 0.03 to 51 l. The foraging tunnels extended as far as 70 m from the loose soil region. The nests of this species are the deepest within the genus Atta and have the highest number of chambers.
