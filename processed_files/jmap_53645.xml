Weathering and mobility sequence of minor elements on a basaltic pedomorphic surface, Galilee, IsraelA number of minor elements was determined in 21 samples of several soil profiles of a young pedomorphic surface on basalt, Upper Galilee, Israel, ranging from red basaltic Lithosols to lithic Red Mediterranean soils and montmorillonitic Grumusols (Xerorthents, Lithic Xerochrepts, and Chromoxererts).  Strontium and to a lesser extent barium are lost during the weathering of the feldspars; Sr continues to be leached out on the slope. Titanium concentrates in the non-clay residue and follows iron during its redistribution on the slope. Manganese is more mobile than iron. Cobalt is partially correlated with manganese, but like Ni, Cr, Cu and V, these elements do not show any definite trend and appear to be rather immobile under the moderate weathering conditions of the Mediterranean environment where montmorillonite is the major clay mineral.
