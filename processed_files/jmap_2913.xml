Latitudinal and altitudinal patterns of the endemic cacti from the Atacama desert to Mediterranean ChileIn this study we describe the biogeographic patterns of the endemic cacti from the Atacama Desert to the Mediterranean area of Chile. Our goals were: (1) to identify areas of high endemism, (2) to test Rapoport's rule, (3) to test the geometric constraints hypothesis, (4) to explore temperature and precipitation as explanatory variables of species richness. We used a list of 72 species of cacti, ranging from 18 degrees to 36 degrees S and from 0 to 4500 m.a.s.l. A Bayesian analysis of Endemicity (BAE) was used to evaluate hierarchical relationships of endemism between different latitudinal bands. Rapoport's rule was evaluated by examining the relationships between latitudinal/altitudinal mid-point, latitudinal/altitudinal range extent and species richness. The geometric constraints hypothesis was tested by examining the existence of mid-domain effect. The BAE indicated two areas of endemism: (1) the northern area between 18 degrees S and 26 degrees S. and (2) the southern area between 27 degrees S and 36 degrees S. The shape of the latitudinal gradient is non-linear, supporting the geometric constraints hypothesis. Altitudinal patterns, however, support Rapoport's rule: a peak of endemism was found at low altitudes. The explanatory variables were elevation, minimum temperature of the coldest month, mean temperature of wettest quarter and annual precipitation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
