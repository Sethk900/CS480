Mineralogical composition of salt efflores-  cences in a Typic Salorthid, Spain. Geoderma, 28: 39--51.    Samples of salt efflorescences were collected from a Typic Salorthid in Central Spain  during the summer and winter seasons. Mineralogy and chemical composition of the ef-  florescences were then determinated by X-ray diffraction, petrographic and SEM obser-  vations and chemical analyses.  The identified mineralogical associations are of two types: a winter type characterised  by mirabilite--thenardite--epsomite--bloedite, and a summer type constituted of thenar-  dite--bloedite. Chemical determinations indicate a predominance of sulphates, mainly of  sodium, although a relative increase of the magnesium content was observed in the winter  samples.    INTRODUCTION    Salt efflorescences from a soil in the zone denominated "El Salobral"  near Aranjuez (Madrid) were studied (Fig.l). Although saline soils in Spain  do not constitute a high percentage of the total arable land, nevertheless  important and extensive areas of these soils are found in a total amount of  about 300,000 ha. Our work was done to get a better knowledge of the  mineralogy and morphology of salt efflorescences because reclamation of  saline soils requires understanding of the behaviour of salts in soils.  The soil, classified by us as a "Typic Salorthid", (Gumuzzio et al., 1981)  is in a Quaternary alluvial plain of slight slope, nearly level, at 560 m altitude  and with serious difficulties for runoff and internal drainage (Fig.2). Miocene  formations of Vindobonian age with evaporite facies constituted mainly of  gypsum and gypsum marls border the alluvial plain.  The soils with the salt efflorescences has a high water table with consider-  able fluctuations during the year. Ground waters become high in salts in dry  periods, due to high evapotranspiration values, and the water table drops to    0016-7061/82/0000--0000/$02.75 1982 Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company    40    N  MADRID         ~.

In wet periods the ground  water level rises, the distribution of soluble salts in the profile becomes  homogeneous, and water reaches the soil surface. At this point the soil is  flooded from being an internal basin with very poor drainage.    CLIMATE AND SALT MOVEMENTS    Referred to the nearest meteorological stations (Aranjuez, La Guardia,  Ocafia and Villasequilla de Yepes), climatic data show high uniformity.  The mean annual precipitation is about 437 mm and the mean annual  evapotranspiration is 752 rnm.  The climatograms of Fig.3, obtained from soil--water balances, show a wide  period of deficit (precipitation less than evapotranspiration when the water re-  serve in soil is equal to zero), extending through July, August and September  and even parts of June and October. The remaining time is distributed among    41    Fig.2. View of the studied area showing Miocene formations at the upper part.    the recuperation period (from the end of October to the beginning of  February), the surplus period (from the beginning of February to the begin-  ning of April), and the utilization period (from the beginning of April to the  end of June).  The highest monthly evapotranspiration occurs in July and August, with  values of about 150 mm. Precipitation for each of these months is the  lowest, about 10 ram. The highest monthly precipitation corresponds to the  periods of February--April and October--November, with values of about  50 ram. These data allow characterisation of the climate as "mesothermic  semiarid".  Consequently, the greatest abundance of salt efflorescences should be ex-  pected in the July--August period. Moreover, the mineralogical species  which constitute them will pass progressively into the soil solution (depend-  ing on their respective solubilities) as the amount of precipitation increases  and the process of downward movement would culminate in the period of  February--April.  Because of the dependence of solubilities of salts on temperature changes  (mainly for Na2SO4) the following data become significant: (1) mean annual  temperature in the zone is 13.5C; (2) the coldest months in the year are  December and January, with mean monthly temperatures of 4C, and the  minimum absolute temperature in the year is approximately --5C; (3) the    200  (rnm)  100  80  60  40  ;tO  0    42    J  F M A M  J  J A S 0 N  ITTII1 s          ~:~1.  ~u          [Z]D    ()  4O  30  20  10  0  -I 0  J      F M A     M     J      J A      S     O    N    D    () I  40  30  20  10  0    t  (mm)  100      (oC)  80        40  ~  60       30  Arn  40           20  20        10  7. 5  0  F  M  A  M   J   J  A   S  0  N  D    ITT~ w P    r-3oP    ubc  rne.$  1 m                   +~  +2  4-1  '0  i  i  I  n  I IIBI~ I  I  I  F M  A  M  J   J A   S  0   N  D  I~l cPB :      E23 D P~l    Fig.3.

Because of these conditions, certain mineralogical species with solubilities  strongly dependent on temperature (i.e., mirabilite) are likely to be found in  December and January. Precipitation does not reach its maximum during  these months.    43    SAMPLING    In order to study the changes in chemical and mineralogical composition  of salt efflorescences, sampling was done in two periods of the year: July--  August and December--January, although field observations were made in  other months as well.  Salt efflorescences were sampled from the surface and found intimately  mixed with soil particles. They have a white, sponge-like, dusty appearance  and are more abundant and extensive in the summer than in the winter  season.  During the winter sampling the presence of transparent crystals was ob-  served at places with high humidity or protection from direct insolation, as  well as stratified crystalline masses, several centimetres thick (Fig.4). Samples  of these crystals were taken for further analysis. Such crystals were also  found within the soil mass at depths of a few centimetres (horizons All and  A12).    Fig.4. Stratifiedcrystalline masses.    One month later, in February, we observed that part of the superficial  crystals had been partially transformed into a whitish powder (Fig.5). The  crystals included in the soil mass had not undergone such transformation,  ascribed to more favourable temperature and moisture conditions.    44    Fig.5. Altered crystals (a) and white powder (b).  Special precautions during transportation and analysis were required  because of rapid alteration of crystals by dehydration.  Ground waters were also sampled in both periods at depths of 70 cm  in summer and 40 cm in winter.  Mineral identification was carried out by means of X-ray diffraction (40  Kv, 20 mA, Cu Ks radiation) and by examination of morphology under  the polarising microscope and the scanning electron microscope. Chemical  analyses included determinations of Ca+*, Mg~, Na K and CO~, HCO~,  SOY and C1- by the methods proposed by the Soil Survey Laboratory of  the U.S.D.A. (1972).    RESULTS    The winter salt efflorescences consisted of perfectly transparent idio-  morphic crystals, 2--3 cm long (Fig.6) that become altered to a white  powdered substance within a few hours under laboratory conditions. When  studied by X-ray diffraction, these two phases were identified as mirabilite  (Na2SO4" 10 H20) and thenardite (Na2SO4), respectively {Tables I and II).  The transformation of one mineral into the other can be easily followed  with the petrographic microscope by means of serial samples, in which the  transparent, anisotropic, biaxial crystals of mirabilite change in successive  stages to a white powder whose optical characteristics are indistinguishable    45    Fig.6.

In fact, observations with the  SEM show absence of well-shaped crystals because mirabilite is transformed  into a cryptocrystalline powder by dehydration.  At the soil surface mirabilite is altered quickly but, within the soil mass,  crystals are preserved and can be easily detected after a few days under  laboratory conditions by breaking apart a soil mass (Fig.7).  The stratified crystalline masses are made up exclusively of mirabilite,    TABLE II  X-ray diffraction analysis of sample W-1 (after dehydration)    47    Sample             Thenardite  5-631    d           I/I1        d           I/II    4.66       65      4.66       73  3.83                15              3.84               18  3.17       44       3.17       51  3.07               36              3.07               47  2.78             100              2.78             100  2.64       48      2.64       48  2.32       24       2.31        21  2.20        4      2.21        5  1.91        2      1.91        4  1.89     3    1.89     4  1.86       30      1.86       31  1.84        4      1.84        6  1.799               4              1.798               4  1.679             14              1.680             12  1.662       8      1.662       8  1.605               4              1.605               5  1.552             11              1.553             10  1.511        2       1.512       2  1.496       4       1.497       5  1.428       3      1.424       5  1.386       2      1.386       3  1.323                2              1.324               3  1.297       4      1.297       6    which is transformed into thenardite as the temperature increases and  humidity decreases. Winter efflorescences are mainly composed of mira-  bilite, accompanied by thenardite with epsomite (MgSO4" 7H20) and bloedite  (Na2 Mg(SO4)2" 4H20) as minor components (Table III). Gypsum has also  been identified in these efflorescences. Large gypsum crystals of a rounded  appearance were observed under the SEM, indicating a detrital origin for  this mineral component.  Summer effiorescences differ in two important characteristics from winter  ones: first, sodium sulphate is present as thenardite, i.e., in a dehydrated  form as expected, and second, epsomite, which is relatively abundant in  winter samples, has not been detected in any of the summer samples (Table  IV).  Summer efflorescences are characterised by associations of thenardite--  bloedite with compositions ranging from nearly pure thenardite to prac-  tically equal proportions of the two minerals. In addition, summer samples  contain differing amounts of detrital minerals, mainly gypsum and quartz.    48    TABLE IIl    X-ray diffraction analysis of winter efflorescences (altered)  Sample            Thenardite        Bloedite         Epsomite  5-631             19-1215         8-467  d      I/I~    d      I/I~    d     I/I,    d     I/I,    5,98        6  ......  5.99      20  5.33       10  ....  5.35      25  4.65       70     4.66       73  .........  4.54      100     --         --        4.56      95     --       --  4.47        10     --         -         4.44       6     --       --  4.27                40           -                    -                 4.28            30          --               -  4.21                26  .....  4.21          100  4.12         6     -          --       4.13      10     --       --  3.96               10                                 --               3.98            10                             --  3.83                  6           3.84               18  .......  3.79       38     --         -       3.80      25     3.79      14  3.32               24           --                  --               3.33            20           --               --  3.28       80     --         --       3.29      95     --       --  3.25       85  ....  3.25     100     --        -  3.17        44     3.17        51  ....  3.07                40           3.07                47  .......  2.97        30     --         --       2.97      40     2.97      14  2.88        7  ........  2.88      20  2,78               79           2.78             100  ....  2.73        20     --         --       2.73      40     2.74      14  2.67        14     --         --       2.68      14     2.67      25  2.65       77     2.646      48     2.65      40     2.65      20  2.58       20  ....  2.58     20     --       --  2.32        24     2.32       21     2.31      10      -  2.27                11           --                  --               2.27             20           --               --  2.02               13                                  -                2.02            30           --               --  1.95                  8           --                  --               1.959          16           --               --  1.863      24     1.864      31  ......  1.682               9           1.680             12  ......    The chemical analyses of both winter and summer efflorescences (Table  V) indicate that sodium predominates over magnesium, whereas potassium  and calcium are present in very low proportions. Among anions, sulphate  clearly predominates over chloride, bicarbonate and carbonate. Otherwise  the Mg/Na ratio is higher in winter efflorescences than in the summer ones,  ranging from 0.49 to 0.06, respectively.  Because of higher abundance of efflorescences in the summer months  the relative concentrations of the various ions differ and, consequently,  comparisons of analytical results for summer and winter samples should be  made with caution.

Chemical analyses of a mirabilite crystal are in full agreement with the  standard composition of the mineral (Table V).  Chemical analyses of the groundwaters of winter and summer (Table  VI) show high saline concentration, with sodium, magnesium and sulphate  predominating. The higher relative concentration in magnesium in summer  waters is noteworthy.    50    TABLE V    Chemical analyses (meq./100 g)    Sample                      Ca2+     Mg~+  Winter efflorescences     23.00   418.50  Summer efflorescences    20.00    71.50  Mirabilite crystals          5.50    15.00  Sample                    CO~     HCO~  Winter efflorescences  Summer efflorescences  Mirabilite crystals    Na       K +      Total  847.50        13.00       1302.00  1141.50          4.50       1237.50  619.50          2.50         692.50  SO ~ -      Cl      Total    4.00          18.00       1193.00        18.00       1233.00  0.00            6.00       1320.00        14.00       1340.00  0.00            0.00          580.00          2.00          582.00    TABLE VI    Chemical analysis of ground waters (meq./1)  Ca2+                Mg 2+      Na+  Summer  Winter    Summer  Winter    K 22.25             805.12   1317.39        2.38  11.40             189.54   1525.65        1.30  co~ + HCO;   Cl      SO2  10.02             174.6     1898.5  7.80              95.3     1647.2    DISCUSSION    The associations of minerals identified in the efflorescences correspond  to the system mirabilitemthenardite--bloedite--epsomite, although not all  four minerals are necessarily present in both summer and winter. Mirabilite  and epsomite can only be found during the winter, whereas thenardite is  predominant in summer. This mineral may also be present in winter but  only under unusual conditions as a transformation product of mirabilite. Our  field and laboratory observations show that mirabilite is readily transformed  to thenardite through dehydration. Bloedite is present during both winter  and summer seasons.  Differences in the forms of Na2SO4 {mirabilite versus thenardite) from  summer to winter are attributed to the variations in moisture and tempera-  ture from one season to other and to differences in the solubilities of the  salts (Braitsch, 1962}. With lower temperature and higher humidity in winter,  Na2SO4 is more hydrated and takes the form of mirabflite. Because of the rel-    51    atively low solubility of this mineral, it tends to remain in the efflorescences  rather than being leached downward in the soft. With higher temperatures  and lower humidity in summer, the Na2SO4 is less hydrated and occurs in  the form of thenardite. This mineral is more soluble than mirabilite and  hence is more subject to downward transfers in solution.  The climatic conditions in winter facilitate the formation of epsomite.  The presence of this mineral takes away an enrichment of Mg in the efflores-  cences which is apparently related with the decrease of this cation in ground  waters.  The stability field of bloedite indicates that this mineral depends for its  formation much more directly on concentrations of ions in solution than on  temperature and humidity, which is in accordance with its presence during  both summer and winter.

Mineralogy and chemical composition of the efflorescences were then determinated by X-ray diffraction, petrographic and SEM observations and chemical analyses.The identified mineralogical associations are of two types: a winter type characterised by mirabiliteâthenarditeâepsomiteâbloedite, and a summer type constituted of thenarditeâbloedite. Chemical determinations indicate a predominance of sulphates, mainly of sodium, although a relative increase of the magnesium content was observed in the winter samples.
