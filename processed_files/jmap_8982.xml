Carbon accumulation, nitrogen and phosphorus use efficiency of Sophora davidii seedlings in response to nitrogen supply and water stressA greenhouse experiment was conducted to explore whether additional nitrogen (N) supply could enhance carbon (C) accumulation, and phosphorus (P) use efficiency (NUEP) of Sophora davidii seedlings under dry conditions. Two-month-old seedlings were subjected to a completely randomized design with three water (80, 40 and 20% water field capacity (FC)) and three N supply (N0: 0, Nl: 92 and Nh: 184 mg N kgâˆ’1 soil) regimes. Water stress decreased C, N and P accumulation, NUEP, N and P uptake efficiency (NUtEN and NUtEP) regardless of N supply. The S. davidii seedlings exhibited strong responses to N supply, but the responses were not consistent with the various N supply levels. Nl increased C, N and P accumulation, and improved NUEP, NUtEN and NUtEP in the same water treatment. In contrast, Nh did few or even depress effects on C, N and P accumulation, and NUEP, although NUtEN and NUtEP increased with Nh in the same water treatment. Even so, NUEN decreased with increase of N supply in the same water treatment. The results suggested that appropriate or low N supply should be recommended for S. davidii seedling establishment in dry environment by improving C accumulation and NUEP.
