Solution and use of chronofunctions in studying soil development.  Geoderma, 24: 71--85.    Thirty-two chronosequences from 27 areas were selected from the literature for con-  structing chronofunctions and for correlating rates of change in soil properties with vari-  ables representing climate and parent material. The chronosequences originate from areas  situated between 66 and 78S latitude and represent seven climatic regions, ranging  from tropical rainy to cold desert, and seven types of parent materials, including till,  aeolian sand, alluvium, mine spoil, volcanic ash, raised beach deposits, and mudflows.  Fourteen of the chronosequences contain soils which range in age from 0 to 500 yr; seven  span a 12,000-yr period, three a 100,000-yr period, and eight a period of greater than one  million yr. Three linear and non-linear models were tested on 15 soil properties. The single-  logarithmic ( Y = a + b log X) model yielded the best correlation coefficients, when soil  property (Y) was correlated with time iX), using linear regression techniques. The dates  and equations allow for the following conclusions:  (1) The rates of decrease in pH and in base saturation are similar, regardless of the na-  ture of the parent material or climate.  (2) The rates of increase in clay content of the B horizon and solum thickness are posi-  tively correlated with clay content of the parent material.  (3) The rates of increase in solum thickness, oxidation depth, soluble salt content of  the salt-enriched horizon, and clay content of the B horizon are positively correlated with  mean annual temperature whereas the rate of increase in total N in the surface mineral  soil is negatively correlated with present-day mean annual temperature.  (4) The increase in bulk density of the surface soil is positively correlated with present  mean annual precipitation.  (5) The rate of change in C:N is not correlated with variables representing climate and  parent material.    INTRODUCTION    Jenny (1941, 1961) defined a chronosequence as an array of related soils  in a geographic area that differ primarily as a result of the soil-forming factor,  time. He identified a chronofunction as the mathematical solution of the rela-  tionship:  s = f(t)cl, o, r, p...                                                (1)    0016-7061/80/0000--0000/$02.25 1980 Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company    72    where the soil (s) and the properties that define it are functions of time (t),  with the variables of climate (cl), organisms (o), relief (r), and parent material  (p) remaining constant.  There are more than seventy published reports of chronosequences in the  pedological, ecological, and geological literature. Some of these were reviewed  by Stevens and Walker (1970). Yaalon (1975) reviewed univariant solutions of  Jenny's soil-forming equation, pointing out the lack of time-variant functions.  Olson's (1958) study of a chronosequence of soils on sand dunes in northern  Indiana may represent the only published attempt to define a chronofunction  using more than one date. He used an exponential function to show the rela-  tionship between time and soil properties, including cation exchange, exchange  acidity, exchangeable bases, and amounts of carbon, nitrogen and carbonates.  He obtained correlation coefficients as high as 0.997 (P &lt; 0.01).  The changes in a given soil property as a function of time have been shown  graphically by numerous investigators (e.g., Dickson and Crocker, 1953a, b;  1954; Crocker and Major, 1955; Crocker and Dickson, 1957; Ugolini, 1968).  The few quantitative solutions of the rate functions generally have been based  on a single date and the use of a model selected in accordance with chemical  kinetics (e.g., Hay, 1960; Ruxton, 1968; Behling, 1972). Numerous investiga-  tors have depicted the relationship between soil properties (and soil taxa) and  time as being exponential or logarithmic even though dates may not be avail-  able (e.g., Yaalon, 1971; Birkeland, 1974).  Vreeken (1975) discussed four principal kinds of chronosequences distin-  guished on the basis of times of the initiation and termination of soil develop-  ment and on the degree of overlap in soil history. He suggested that only  chronosequences containing soils which began forming at the same point in  time but which terminated development at different points in time are useful  in studying rates of soil development. Few of the chronosequences in the  literature fall into this category.  Soil chronofunctions are useful for studying pedogenesis, for providing  relative dates of geologic events (e.g., Campbell and Claridge, 1975) and for  predicting recovery rates of disturbed soils. Yaalon (1971) grouped soil pro-  perties according to the periods required for attainment of a dynamic steady  state: (1) rapidly adjusting (&lt; 103 yr); (2) slowly adjusting (&lt; 10a yr); and  (3) persistent. The latter were viewed as produced by irreversible or "self-  terminating" processes.  The objectives of this study are: (1) to review the literature regarding soil  chronosequences and evaluate its suitability as a basis for development of  chronofunctions, (2) to derive soil chronofunctions using different linear and  non-linear models, and (3) to compare chronofunctions of a given soil pro-  perty for different climatic regions and parent materials.    METHODS    About half of the published reports of chronosequences in the literature  were rejected because of poor dating control and/or incompleteness of analyt-    73    ical data. Others were disqualified because of difficulties in processing the  data because of the wide variety of soil properties considered (about 75 pro-  perties) and differences in depth of sampling, analytical techniques, and units  for expressing data. A major restriction in using some of the more complete  chronosequences was that the data were displayed graphically rather than  numerically.  Several steps were taken in calculating chronofunctions. The most useful  data were first organized into tables with measurements converted into the  same units. Each soil property was correlated with time using linear regres-    sion techniques and the three models:  Y=a+bX  Y = a + (b logX)  logY=a+{blogX)    (2)  (3)  (4)    where Y = soil property and X = time. Exponential and polynomial models  were employed at the beginning of the study but were discarded because they  did not fit the data. The quality of the relationship between a soil property and  time was expressed through the use of the correlation coefficient, r. Fifteen  soil properties were included in the analysis. The b regression coefficient, or  slope of the chronofunction of a particular soil property, was regressed on  variables representing climate, including mean annual temperature, mean an-  nual precipitation, average annual potential evapotranspiration, and moisture  index. A major limitation to the use of these climatic variables is that they  represent present-day climate and do not reflect past climate changes. For ex-  ample, Leamy (1974) discovered that pedogenic carbonate accumulated  faster in post-glacial times than during the latter part of the Wiirm glaciation  in western Europe. Parent material was represented by the clay content of  the C horizon. There were insufficient data to include mineralogy of the  parent material in the analysis.  Because most of the sampling sites were located on flat or gently sloping  landforms, the soil-forming factor, topography, was not considered in the  analysis. The factor, organisms, is difficult to quantify and was not evaluated.    RESULTS    Examples of chronosequences    Data from 32 chronosequences from 27 areas were selected as a suitable  basis for developing chronofunctions (Table I). The chronosequences were  situated from 66 to 78 latitude and encompass seven climatic regions,  ranging from tropical rainy to cold desert, and seven types of parent materials,  including till, aeolian sand, alluvium, mine spoil, raised beach deposits, volcan-  ic ash, and mudflow materials. Till was the parent material in 17 of the 32  studies.

Seven of the chronosequences correspond to the 12,000-yr period  since the last major continental glaciation. In these chronosequences, radio-  carbon dates predominated. Three of the chronosequences cover a 100,000-yr  period, and eight a period exceeding 1 million years. These long-term studies  relied on radiometric dating and correlation with dated landforms or deposits  using principles of stratigraphy.    Mathematical solution    The logarithmic functions generally provided the best correlations between  time and the four soil properties most frequently cited in the chronosequence  literature (Table II).

A  chronofunction is an example of a univariant function, where the magnitude  of a given property is correlated only with time. Multivariant soil properties  are dependent on two or more soil-forming factors. For example, multivariant  soil properties include those for which the rate of development, or the slope  of soil property versus time, can be correlated with a variable representing  some other soil-forming factor, such as climate or parent material.    Univariant chronofunctions. Of the 15 properties considered in the analysis,  only base saturation and pH of the surface mineral soil had similar regression  coefficients, regardless of differences in climate, parent material, and organ-  isms. For example, the rate of decrease in pH with time is similar for chrono-  sequences derived from dune sand in the United Kingdom, till in southeastern    77    Alaska, and alluvium in interior Alaska (Fig. 1). The rate of decrease in per-  cent base saturation is similar for chronosequences in areas with mean annual  temperatures ranging from 34 to 138 cm (Fig. 2). This suggests that not only  do the processes of leaching of bases and development of acidity occur very  rapidly in soils, but also that they occur independently of climate, parent  material, and organisms, at least within the ranges of these factors considered  in this study. These trends contrast with the findings of Jenny et al. (1968)  who reported a strong relationship between degree of acidity and mean annu-  al precipitation. These differences in interpretation are even more puzzling in    lOO       ~             Mean annual         precipitation (cm)  80                          1   138  \\   \\    2  118   60                                 84  20  3  0~~      102      103     104      105  Time (years)  Fig. 1.

The chrofiofunctions of organic matter content and C:N ratio in the surface  mineral, horizon and that of extractable iron in the B horizon differed among  study areas but could not be related to the variables representing climate or  parent material. In contrast, Jenny et al. (1968} showed a strong correlation  between the organic carbon content of a variety of California soils and both  mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation.  The carbon:nitrogen ratio of the surface mineral horizon was either posi-  tively or negatively correlated (P = 0.01) with time. The trends in C:N could  be due to the composition of the plant litter which has been incorporated in-  to the surface mineral horizon. The increase in C:N ratio in soils of northern  California (Dickson and Crocker, 1953b) and southeastern Alaska (Crocker  and Dickson, 1957) may be attributed to a decrease in nitrogen-fixing species  and a concurrent increase in coniferous litter byproducts in the soils with  time. In contrast, the decrease in C:N ratio in soils of northern Minnesota  (Leisman, 1957) and interior Alaska (Viereck, 1966) may be due to the ab-  sence of conifers in the successional sequence. Jenny et al. {1968) reported  that vegetation accounted for 40% of the variation in C:N of soils in  California. Carbon:nitrogen ratio was the only soil property examined by  Jenny et al. (1968} which was related to vegetation.    50    40  N   20  U  10    1    Clay [o),  C horizon  1   39  2   9  3     0.5  4     3.5  5   11  I           I           I          J  io~      ios      1o6      io~  Time (years)    Fig. 3.

The rate of increase in the  amount of clay in the B horizon was not correlated with variables represent-  ing climate but was correlated with the clay content of the parent material  (Fig. 3, Table III). Argillic horizons form under a wide variety of tempera-  ture and moisture regimes and are found in Aridisols, Alfisols, Ultisols and  Mollisols. Clay enrichment may also occur in B horizons of Spodosols and  Vertisols. Cline (1957) reported what are now recognized as argiUic horizons  in soils derived from loamy drift in New York, but not in soils formed from  silt loam and fine sandy loam drift. Jenny et al. (1968) found no relation-  ship between clay content of California soils and any of the five soil-forming  factors.  In this study rate of increase in thickness of solum was correlated with clay  content of the parent material (Table III). Analysis of lithosequence data  given by Yassaglou et al. (1969} and Holt and McMiller (1956) showed signifi-  cant positive correlations between thickness of solum and clay content of the  C horizon.

The rates of change in oxidation  depth, solum thickness, electrical conductivity of the salt-enriched horizon,  total N and bulk density of the surface mineral horizon, and clay content of  the B horizon were correlated with variables representing climate (Table III).  For example, the rate of increase in electrical conductivity of the salt-enriched  horizon was inversely correlated with mean annual temperature (Fig. 4). A  comparison of the chronofunctions of electrical conductivity shows that solu-  ble salts accumulate 20 times more rapidly in Antarctica than on Baffin Island  (66) or in the Rocky Mountains (40).  As the mean annual temperature increases, the rate of increase in total N  in the surface soil decreases (Fig. 5). These trends are consistent with the find-  ings of Jenny et al. (1949). This can be attributed to increased microbial de-  composition at higher temperatures.  Bulk density of the surface mineral horizon increased with mean annual  precipitation and was the only soil property correlated with that climatic  variable (Table III).    104       Mean annual"                         /1  ten'cer~ure ('C)               /         0.4  1   -22                   /                /  2  -3e                i                          MEAN   ANNUAL  /  3   - 8.0  ~             ~~                   o~           ,      -~               /  2      -4.6              /  0.2  0        I0z     103     10      ~          I                                            104    Time (years)  Time  ,  Yeors    Fig. 4.

Whereas the magnitude of most of the soil pro-  perties examined in the present study continued to increase with time, the  values for several properties reached a maximum, then decreased with further  time. These properties included color development of the B horizon (two of  three chronofunctions), amount of forest floor (two of three cases), organic-  matter content of the surface mineral horizon (three of 11 cases), and percent  of dithionite-extractable iron in the B horizon (two of 11 cases).  Yaalon (1971) attributed these types of trends to "self-terminating" or ir-  reversible processes. For example, the decrease in free iron and of the strength  of color of the B horizon may represent a depletion in weatherable, iron-bear-  ing minerals in the solum. The trend in forest-floor accumulation may be ex-  plained by the effect on leaf fall of stocking and competition among trees dur-  ing vegetational succession (Dickson and Crocker, 1953b). Successional stage  could also have influenced the amount of organic matter in the surface miner-  al horizon in those instances where a decrease was noted after a certain point  in time.    CONCLUSIONS    Data contained in 32 chronosequences from the literature were used to  test three models for deriving soil chronofunctions. Fifteen soil properties  were selected for the analysis. The model, Y = a + (b log X), yielded the best  correlation between soil property (Y) and time (X). Because the chronose-  quences represented seven climatic regions and seven types of parent materi-  als, it was possible to compare the rate of change in a particular property  with variables representing these soil-forming factors, using linear regression  techniques.  The study provides a basis for identifying important trends in soil develop-  ment with time and future research needs. The trends shown in this study  cast some doubt as to whether soils reach a steady-state (dynamic equilibrium)  with their environment. Most of the properties investigated continued to  change, despite the passage of as many as 106 years. Moreover, there was no  difference in the capacity of the model, Y = a + (b log X), to predict the pro-  petty--age relationship for chronosequences spanning a 500-yr period than  for those covering a 10~-yr period. More than 85% of the correlation coeffici-  ents were statistically significant.  Climate plays an important role in controlling the rate of soil development.  In this study the rates of increase in solum thickness, oxidation depth, soluble-  salt content of the salt-enriched horizon, and clay content of the B horizon  are positively correlated with mean annual temperature, whereas the rate of in-  crease in total N in the surface mineral horizon is negatively correlated with  present-day mean annual temperature. The rate of increase in bulk density of  the surface soil is positively correlated with present mean annual precipitation.  The rate of soil development is also influenced by the nature of the parent  material. In this study, the rates of increase in clay content of the B horizon    82    and solum thickness are positively correlated with clay content of the parent  material.  Soil pH and base saturation decrease with time independently of climate,  parent material, and biotic factors.  For future research dealing with soil chronosequences, the following sug-  gestions are given. In constructing chronosequences, extreme care must be  exercised in making certain that the other soil-forming factors are invariant.  Dating of the sediments or landscapes on which the soils occur must be ac-  curate. Chronosequences established without dating or based on one date are  of limited value in the study of rates of soil formation.  Additional chronofunctions, particularly in tropical rainy, subtropical  desert, and humid continental regions, need to be prepared using the models  considered in this study and other more sophisticated models. Chronose-  quence data should be expressed in tables rather than graphs so that the rate  functions can be quantitatively solved. A standardization of methodology for  preparing chronofunctions would be useful, especially with regard to establish-  ing sampling depths or intervals, determining which properties are to be con-  sidered, and selecting laboratory methods and units for expressing the data.  Vreeken (1975) questioned the validity of what he called "post-incisive"  chronosequences, i.e., those which contain soils beginning at different points  in time and with a partial overlap in soil history, for studying pathways and  rates of soil development. Most chronosequences in the literature are post-  incisive. Those individuals preparing such chronosequences assume that the  soils have developed at the same rate, although some of the soils may be  polygenetic. Therefore, additional effort should be made to test the validity  of post-incisive chronosequences through an investigation of the effects of  climatic change, vegetational succession, and landscape evolution on soil  chronosequences.  Finally, we need to test the prediction equations established from the data  compiled in this study. New equations are needed for relating rates of change  in soil properties with variables representing climate and parent material. Ad-  ditional parameters expressing climate, parent material, and vegetation should  be considered.    ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS    F.D. Hole, P.W. Birkeland and J.E.

AbstractThirty-two chronosequences from 27 areas were selected from the literature for constructing chronofunctions and for correlating rates of change in soil properties with variables representing climate and parent material. The chronosequences originate from areas situated between 66Â°N and 78Â°S latitude and represent seven climatic regions, ranging from tropical rainy to cold desert, and seven types of parent materials, including till, aeolian sand, alluvium, mine spoil, volcanic ash, raised beach deposits, and mudflows. Fourteen of the chronosequences contain soils which range in age from 0 to 500 yr; seven span a 12,000-yr period, three a 100,000-yr period, and eight a period of greater than one million yr. Three linear and non-linear models were tested on 15 soil properties. The single-logarithmic (Y = a + b log X) model yielded the best correlation coefficients, when soil property (Y) was correlated with time (X), using linear regression techniques. The dates and equations allow for the following conclusions: 1.(1) The rates of decrease in pH and in base saturation are similar, regardless of the nature of the parent material or climate.2.(2) The rates of increase in clay content of the B horizon and solum thickness are positively correlated with clay content of the parent material.3.(3) The rates of increase in solum thickness, oxidation depth, soluble salt content of the salt-enriched horizon, and clay content of the B horizon are positively correlated with mean annual temperature whereas the rate of increase in total N in the surface mineral soil is negatively correlated with present-day mean annual temperature.4.(4) The increase in bulk density of the surface soil is positively correlated with present mean annual precipitation.5.(5) The rate of change in C:N is not correlated with variables representing climate and parent material.
