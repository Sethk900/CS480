However, little is understood how heterospecific interactions affect ecosystem productivity because rarely are biodiversity ecosystem functioning experiments spatially explicitly manipulated. To test the effect of heterospecific interactions on productivity, direct evidence of heterospecific neighborhood interaction is needed. In this study we conducted experiments with a detailed spatial design to investigate whether and how heterospecific neighborhood interactions promote primary productivity in a grassland community. The results showed that increasing the heterospecific: conspecific contact ratio significantly increased productivity. We found there was a significant difference in the variation in plant height between monoculture and mixture communities, suggesting that height-asymmetric competition for light plays a central role in promoting productivity. Heterospecific interactions make tall plants grow taller and short plants become smaller in mixtures compared to monocultures, thereby increasing the efficiency of light interception and utilization. Overyielding in the mixture communities arises from the fact that the loss in the growth of short plants is compensated by the increased growth of tall plants. The positive correlation between species richness and primary production was strengthened by increasing the frequency of heterospecific interactions. We conclude that species richness significantly promotes primary ecosystem production through heterospecific neighborhood interactions.We conducted an intensive study to investigate the effect of interspecific interactions on plant growth in grassland communities and to show how that gives rise to a positive diversity-productivity relationship. The study consisted of two complementary experiments. The first experiment was designed to measure the growth of plants in each grid within a series of plots that varied in sowing density, species richness and frequency of heterospecific interactions. The second experiment enhanced the first one by adding more diversity levels. Based on these, we first modeled the effects of species richness and the frequency of heterospecific interactions on plant growth across the plots. We then tested the hypothesis that the positive effect of heterospecific interactions on productivity in grassland communities was driven by height-asymmetric competition for light in mixture plots.The study site is maintained by Heerkou Town, Fengkai County, Guangdong Province, China. The site was leased to Sun Yat-sen University from 2009 to 2013 for conducting the grassland experiments reported in this study. Our study did not involve any damage to land resources and no specific permissions were required for this research. Our experiments didnâ€™t contain any treatments with chemical addition. The seeds of all plant species used in our experiments were collected from the area around the experimental site, and these plants were neither endangered nor protected species.For experiment II, aboveground biomass for each species was harvested for each plot (belowground biomass was not measured). The plants of each species in each plot were weighed after oven drying at 80Â°C for 48 hours. This experiment had four species richness levels (one, two, four, and eight species) compared to the first experiment that had two species richness levels (one and eight species). This experiment complemented the first one by showing how productivity changed with species richness at different levels of heterospecific interactions in the aggregated versus dispersed plot designs.To test the hypothesis that height-asymmetric competition for light is responsible for overyielding in mixture plots, we compared the root/shoot biomass ratio, plant height and height variance for monocultures, aggregated mixtures and dispersed mixtures. If competition for light is a determining factor, we should expect the variation in height to increase from monocultures to aggregated and finally to dispersed mixtures, while the average height remains largely unchanged. We should also see that heterospecific competition would make tall plants grow taller and for short plants to become smaller in mixture plots compared to monocultures.It is, however, worth noting that the effect of species richness is not entirely explained by the frequency of heterospecific interactions. There are three possible reasons why the richness effect is not amount to the effect of the frequency of heterospecific interactions. First, the frequency of heterospecific interactions depends on the spatial distribution of conspecifics within plot. For a given number of species in a plot, the frequency of heterospecific interactions is small for aggregated conspecifics compared to dispersed conspecifics. Second, because the frequency of heterospecific interactions is a simple count of neighborhoods, it does not necessarily represent the genuine competitive (or facilitative) interactions between heterospecific individuals. To measure the competitive (or facilitative) interactions, distance between neighbors has to be considered. Third, the interactive strength is different between individuals of different species, e.g., the neighborhood interaction between individuals of species A and B is not equivalent to the interaction between the individuals of species B and C. This â€œdiffusedâ€ neighborhood interactions among species could also contribute to the difference in the residual effects between richness and the frequency of heterospecific interactions.(XLSX)(XLSX)We are grateful to Weinan Ye, Xianggang Shi, Xubing Liu and Jie Li for their help in the field.
