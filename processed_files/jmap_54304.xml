Micro-scale soil variability along a short moraine ridge at Okstindan, Northern NorwayFour soils developed along a moraine ridge crest are described. Morphologically three of the four soils had distinct podzol (Spodosol) profiles. When the chemical and morphological criteria used by three classification systems and the F.A.O. soil map legend are applied to the soils, however, this results in a divergence in the classification/designation of the four soils. Local differences in the height of the ridge crest above the adjacent till plain, are thought to be sufficient to cause changes in the micro-climate along the ridge. These differences in micro-climate appear in turn to influence the pattern and extent of colonisation by vegetation along the ridge crest. These two factors interact to produce the observed intensification of podzol development along the ridge crest from site 4, the most exposed site, to site 1, the least exposed site.
