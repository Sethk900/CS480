Associations of yield and yield components among selected durum wheats (Triticum turgidum L.)Associations of seed yield (SY) and important agronomic traits were studied among selected durum wheats (Triticum turgidum L.) to establish the relationship and pinpoint the best selection criteria. Controlled glasshouse studies were conducted over two years (2002â€“2003) using 14 diverse lines. The result from simple correlation analysis indicated that SY had a significant (P<0.01) negative correlation with heading date as well as positive associations with plant height (PH), number of spikelets per spike (SP), kernel numbers per spike (KS) and 1000-kernel weight (KW). A further path analysis on the association of seed yield on five selected traits allocated high values for KW and SP. The direct path value of the analysis showed that there was no association between SY and PH. The indirect path values further suggested that selection for KW would bring about simultaneous and favorable changes to KS, SP, and PH than selecting the traits per se. Improved seed yield among durum lines may be achieved by directly selecting for KW and SP.
