Taxonomic revision of the Elephant Pupinid snail genus Pollicaria Gould, 1856 (Prosobranchia, Pupinidae)Abstract The status of species currently assigned to the Southeast Asian Elephant Pupinid snail genus Pollicaria Gould, 1856 is reassessed. Shell, radular and reproductive morphology are investigated and analysed with reference to karyotype patterns previously reported and to distribution patterns among the species. Six previously described species are recognised: Pollicaria gravida (Benson, 1856), Pollicaria myersii (Haines, 1855), Pollicaria mouhoti (Pfeiffer, 1862), Pollicaria elephas (Morgan, 1885), Pollicaria crossei (Dautzenberg & dâ€™Hamonville, 1887) and Pollicaria rochebruni (Mabille, 1887). A new subspecies, Pollicaria mouhoti monochroma ssp. n.,is proposed and a dichotomous key to species is provided.
