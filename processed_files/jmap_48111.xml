Life cycle of Huarpea fallax (Hymenoptera: Sapygidae) in a xeric forest in ArgentinaThis study describes the life cycle of Huarpea fallax (Hymenoptera: Sapygidae) in a xeric forest in La Pampa province, Argentina. This cleptoparasitic wasp attacks the nests of two species of leaf-cutter bees: Megachile catamarcensis and Anthidium vigintipunctatum, both belonging to the family Megachilidae. Nests of these bee species were obtained during a trap-nesting programme. Adult emergence showed a unimodal pattern indicating a univoltine life cycle. The period from egg-laying to adult emergence lasted for 10–13 months; however, one female took about 2 years to emerge, suggesting parsivoltinism. Most females attack one cell per host nest, the outermost cells being the ones most parasitized. However, the position of the attacked cells was variable. In this paper, although there were insufficient data to prove a correlation, the data suggest a positive trend between body size of sapygid wasps and their host bees.
