Tidal Growth Increments in the Cockle Clinocardium nuttalliSets of growth lines in the shell of Clinocardium nuttalli are extinguished every 13 or 14 increments only to be replaced by other sets, half an increment out of phase with the first. This can be explained only by assuming that the lines are deposited during periods of exposure at low tide. The average duration of an increment is 24 hours and 50 minutes.
