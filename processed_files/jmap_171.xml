Leopard density in post-conflict landscape, Cambodia: Evidence from spatially explicit capture-recapture.Effective conservation of large carnivores requires reliable estimates of population density, often obtained through capture-recapture analysis, in order to prioritize investments and assess conservation intervention effectiveness. Recent statistical advances and development of user-friendly software for spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) circumvent the difficulties in estimating effective survey area, and hence density, from capture-recapture data. We conducted a camera-trapping study on leopards (<em>Panthera pardus</em>) in Mondulkiri Protected Forest, Cambodia. We compared density estimates using SECR with those obtained from conventional approaches in which the effective survey area is estimated using a boundary strip width based on observed animal movements. Density estimates from Chao heterogeneity models (3.8±SE 1.9individuals/100km<sup>2</sup>) and Pledger heterogeneity models and models accounting for gender-specific capture and recapture rates (model-averaged density 3.9±SE 2.9individuals/100km<sup>2</sup>) were similar to those from SECR in program DENSITY (3.6±SE 1.0/100km<sup>2</sup>) but higher than estimates from Jack-knife heterogeneity models (2.9±SE 0.9individuals/100km<sup>2</sup>). Capture probabilities differed between male and female leopards probably resulting from differences in the use of human-made trails between sexes. Given that there are a number of biologically plausible reasons to expect gender-specific variation in capture probabilities of large carnivores, we recommend exploratory analysis of data using models in which gender can be included as a covariate affecting capture probabilities particularly given the demographic importance of breeding females for population recovery of threatened carnivores. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.
