Soil respiration in Pinus rigida and Larix leptolepis plantationsSoil respiration was measured every two weeks from May through November 1995 using the soda lime method in 40-year-old Pinus rigida and Larix leptolepis plantations on a similar soil in Yangpyeong, Kyonggi Province. Treatments included control and no-roots (plots trenched and root regrowth into plots prevented). Root respiration was evaluated by comparing no-roots sub-plots to control plots. Mean soil respiration showed highly significant species effects (p lt 0.01) and was highest at the Pinus rigida control plot (0.38 g/m-2/hr) and lowest at the Larix leptolepis no-roots plot (0.31 g/m-2/hr). High soil respiration in Pinus rigida may be related to aboveground litter production. The annual CO-2 fluxes ranged from 23 to 27:/ha/yr. We found significant correlations between temperatures (air: R-2=0.53, soil: R-2=0.55) and soil respiration (p lt 0.01), but no significant correlations between soil moisture and soil respiration (p gt 0.1). Root respiration was 3% of total soil respiration. We might underestimate root respiration because of shallow trenches and CO-2 measurements right after trenching. Factors controlling soil respiration including belowground litterfall (especially fine roots) inputs, litter quality should be well understood to predict soil carbon fluxes and relative contributions to total soil respiration in forest ecosystems.
