Characteristics of a marshland soil built up from marine and peat materialThe marine marshland area seawards of the Sehestedter Au√üendeichsmoor is built up from marine and moor peat material. The Humic Fluvisol investigated in this area is characterized (1) by sulfate depletion leading to intensive methanogenesis, (2) by carbonate depleted soil sections and reduced pH-values, and (3) by high amounts of reduced sulfur compounds. With respect to further development, a quick acidification, leading to soil properties which are characteristic of older, but not currently seawater-influenced Humic Fluvisols, can be expected. Is seems likely that these older Humic Fluvisols initially developed under marine conditions.
