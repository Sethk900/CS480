A new map of mangroves for Kakadu National Park, Northern Australia, based on stereo aerial photography1. Using colour aerial photography, a set of fine (∼1 m) spatial resolution orthomosaics and accompanying Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) were generated for the majority of mangroves in Kakadu National Park, Northern Australia, from which their extent and canopy height have been mapped. 2. The orthomosaics and DEMs, which were based on 68 stereo pairs acquired in 1991, cover an area of approximately 742 km2 and a coastal distance of 86 km. The DEMs have a height resolution of approximately ±1 m. 3. The entire mosaic represents a key historical baseline data set of the extent and height of mangroves within the Park against which to observe and quantify changes in response to, for example, sea-level rise. 4. The data sets will be available to assist management of the coastal environment and also to provide a unique insight into the distribution, dynamics and condition of mangroves. The techniques used are applicable to mangroves and other forested wetlands in other regions of Australia and elsewhere. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.
