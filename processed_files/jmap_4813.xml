Two Farranula (Copepoda: Cyclopoida: Corycaeidae) species from Korean watersIdentification for Farranula species has hitherto been carried out with reference to several fragmentary figures and incomplete descriptions of species from the temperate and tropical oceans. As a result, many identification errors such as mixing of characters of different species and confusing two species have occurred in many taxonomic and ecological studies. It is apparent that morphological details such as mouthparts, relative lengths of endopodal spines of swimming legs, ornamentation on surface of genital somite and length : width proportions are needed to verify taxonomic status. In this study, distinct morphological characters differentiating the genus Farranula from other genera within Corycaeidae are discussed on the basis of detailed redescriptions of Farranula concinna and Farranula gibbula from southern waters off Jeju Island, Korea (East China Sea). This is the first record of F. concinna from Korean Waters.
