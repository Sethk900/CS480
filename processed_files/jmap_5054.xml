Redescription of Euconchoecia chierchiae Müller, 1890 and Euconchoecia aculeata (Scott, 1894) (Halocyprididae: Ostracoda) from the Atlantic, and descriptions of two novel species of Euconchoecia Müller 1890, from the Gulf of OmanThe 100–0 m samples from a stratified zooplankton sample series from the upwelling region of the Gulf of Oman, during February 1997, were numerically dominated by members of the poorly known halocyprid genus Euconchoecia. A modern diagnosis of the genus Euconchoecia is provided and the type species, Euconchoecia chierchiae from the Atlantic is redescribed. A second species from the Atlantic, Euconchoecia aculeata is also redescribed. In the Gulf of Oman samples there are two size groups, and these were previously identified as E. chierchiae and E. aculeata. However, when compared with specimens from the Atlantic and with published descriptions of these two species, the Gulf of Oman specimens could not be assigned to any previously described species. In this paper the Gulf of Oman species are described as new species, Euconchoecia omanensis and Euconchoecia hormuzensis, and are compared in detail with the redescriptions of the Atlantic species, E. chierchiae and E. aculeata.
