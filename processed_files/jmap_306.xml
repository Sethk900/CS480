Response of Deer to Containment by a Poly-Mesh Fence for Mitigating Disease Outbreaks.Rapidly deployable and effective methods are needed to contain free-ranging deer (<em>Odocoileus</em> spp.) during acute disease outbreaks. We evaluated efficacy of a 2.1-m-tall polypropylene mesh (poly-mesh) fence for containing ?15 free-ranging white-tailed deer (<em>O. virginianus</em>) within a 42-ha area in eastern Nebraska, USA. We observed a 99% decrease in deer leaving the enclosure area after we installed fencing (1 deer jumped; 0.02 deer/hr) compared with prefence rates (5.26 deer/hr). However, 8 deer (53% of censused population) escaped the enclosure during a census drive after our study. Poly-mesh fencing may be effective in temporarily containing free-ranging deer during minimally disruptive deer removal actions such as trapping or sharpshooting.
