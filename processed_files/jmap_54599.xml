Enantiomers of 2-butyl 7Z-dodecenoate are sex attractants for males of Adscita mannii (Lederer, 1853), A. geryon (Hübner, 1813), and Jordanita notata (Zeller, 1847) (Lepidoptera: Zygaenidae, Procridinae) in ItalyThe R- and S-enantiomers of 2-butyl (7Z)-dodecenoate (alone or in mixtures), recently identified in the natural extracts of Illiberis rotundata pheromone glands, were used as lures in sticky traps to study the occurrence of Procridinae species in Italy in 14 localities during 2010 and 2011. Three species were attracted during the study – Adscita mannii (Lederer, 1853), A. geryon (Hübner, 1813), and Jordanita notata (Zeller, 1847). The most numerous species was A. mannii. Lures with (2S)-butyl (7Z)-dodecenoate attracted males of Adscita mannii and A. geryon, while those containing (2R)-butyl (7Z)-dodecenoate attracted males of Jordanita notata.
