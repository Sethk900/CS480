Influences of Habitat Isolation on Invertebrate Colonization of Sporadanthus ferrugineus in a Mined Peat BogThis study experimentally tested the impact of peat bog habitat loss and isolation on the invertebrate community associated with Sporadanthus ferrugineus (Restionaceae), a dominant indigenous plant species in peat bogs. Potted S. ferrugineus plants were exposed to invertebrates at various distances up to 800 m from an intact habitat (the source population) over 18 weeks. Invertebrates rapidly colonized the experimental plants, with all major orders and trophic groups present on S. ferrugineus within 6 weeks. However, with increasing distance away from the undisturbed habitat, there was a significant decrease in total species richness and abundance of invertebrates associated with the potted plants. Of the total taxa captured, only 38% were found on potted S. ferrugineus plants at 800 m compared with 62% found on potted plants 30 m from the intact peat bog. Predator species richness and the predatorâ€“prey ratio changed significantly with time available for colonization of potted plants but, more importantly, prey (herbivores and detritivores) and predator (including parasitoids) species richness, as well as the predatorâ€“prey ratio, declined significantly with increasing isolation from the peat bog. Thus, the degree of isolation of restoration areas from undisturbed habitat has a major impact on the rate and patterns of recovery in invertebrate community structure. The current recommended practice of restoring the mined area by establishing raised â€œhabitat islandsâ€ 30 m apart should result in colonization by most invertebrates associated with S. ferrugineus, but only if the restoration islands are placed as stepping stones outward from existing areas of intact habitat.
