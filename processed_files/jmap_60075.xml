Scenario-Based Robust Optimization of Regional Water and Wastewater InfrastructureAbstractUncertainties facing water planners and designers include changes in demand resulting from community growth (temporal and spatial), per capita water use, public perceptions, and regulations. One of the most powerful and intuitive ways to represent these uncertainties in the planning stage is to use scenarios. A scenario represents a realization of the systemâ€™s random parameters. Scenario-based analysis provides organizational flexibility by planning for multiple potential future scenarios, each of which may be, although is not necessarily, associated with a probability of occurrence. In this study, a scenario-based multiobjective optimization model for robust optimal design of regional-scale water and wastewater infrastructure is presented. The proposed methodology is demonstrated with an application to the planning of a decentralized water supply and reuse system for a new development area in metropolitan Tucson, where sustainable water supply is a significant issue.
