Isopódos litorales de la Costa de concepción, Chile centralAbstract Littoral isopods of the coast of Concepción, Central Chile A collection of isopods is studied from the intertidal region of the province of Concepción (Chile), located on the South American pacifics coast between 36 and 37° S latitude. The collection consists of 11 species, two of them new for science: Ianiropsis kussakini, described here, and Janira sp., still under study. The distribution of species is, grosso modo, restricted to the central zone or south center of Chile, which seems to corroborate the opinion of some authors who consider it as a region of biogeographic transition between the Peruvian and Magellan provinces.
