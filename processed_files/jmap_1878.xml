Phenotypic effects on survival of neonatal northern watersnakes Nerodia sipedon.<ol><li>Understanding the trade-off females make between offspring size and number requires knowing how neonatal size, and traits associated with size, affect survival.</li><li>We studied neonatal survival in the northern watersnake <em>Nerodia sipedon</em> in outdoor enclosures with artificial hibernation sites.</li><li>From a total of 950 neonates from 77 litters collected over 3 years, we found a survival rate of 65% between birth and hibernation and 47% during hibernation. Estimated survival from birth to the end of hibernation was 31%, comparable with indirect estimates for free-living watersnakes.</li><li>Consistent with the 'bigger is better' hypothesis, larger neonates and neonates heavier relative to their body length were more likely to survive both the pre-hibernation and hibernation periods.</li><li>Survival in the pre-hibernation period also decreased with the duration of that period and varied among years.</li><li>Survival during hibernation was higher in warmer winters. Mass change prior to hibernation did not affect survival during hibernation.</li><li>These results suggest that an optimal reproductive strategy should exist for female watersnakes, producing a 'consensus' among females on the optimal size for offspring. This expectation stands in stark contrast to the pronounced variation in offspring size observed both within and among litters.</li></ol>
