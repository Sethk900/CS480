Occurrence and gut contents of flatworms on fungal sporocarpsTerrestrial flatworms of the family Rhynchodemidae were collected from fungal sporocarps. The frequency of flatworms on sporocarps differed among fungal species. Gut content analysis showed that the flatworms preyed upon fungivorous Collembola or other arthropods on the sporocarps. Fungal materials were observed in flatworm guts but only on the body surface and in the gut of Collembola prey. Basidiospores were observed on the surfaces of the flatworms.
