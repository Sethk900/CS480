While the effects of invasive species are well-documents, less is known about which specific plant traits convey â€œinvasivenessâ€ because most studies compare closely related, but different species which can confound results. A review of the literature by Mozdzer and other scientists compared genetic lineages of the same species, those native to North American and a lineage introduced from Europe to address this complex issue. The authors found that the ability to change both physiologically and morphologically were the key to success of the introduced genetic lineage under current and predicted global change conditions.Physiological ecology and plant functional traits are often used to explain plant invasion. To gain a better understanding of how traits influence invasion, studies usually compare the invasive plant to a native congener, but there are few conspecific examples in the literature. In North America, the presence of native and introduced genetic lineages of the common reed, <italic>Phragmites australis</italic>, presents a unique example to evaluate how traits influence plant invasion. We reviewed the literature on functional traits of <italic>P. australis</italic> lineages in North America, specifically contrasting lineages present on the Atlantic Coast. We focused on differences in physiology between the lineage introduced from Eurasia and the lineage native to North America, specifically seeking to identify the causes underlying the recent expansion of the introduced lineage. Our goals were to better understand which traits may confer invasiveness, provide predictions of how these lineages may respond to interspecific competition or imminent global change, and provide guidance for future research. We reviewed published studies and articles in press, and conducted personal communications with appropriate researchers and managers to develop a comparative dataset. We compared the native and introduced lineages and focused on plant physiological ecology and functional traits. Under both stressful and favourable conditions, our review showed that introduced <italic>P. australis</italic> consistently exhibited greater ramet density, height and biomass, higher and more plastic relative growth rate, nitrogen productivity and specific leaf area, higher mass specific nitrogen uptake rates, as well as greater phenotypic plasticity compared with the native lineage. We suggest that ecophysiological and other plant functional traits elucidate potential mechanisms for the introduced lineage's invasiveness under current and predicted global change conditions. However, our review identified a disconnect between field surveys, experiments, natural competition and plant ecophysiology that must be addressed in future field studies. Given the likelihood of hybridization between lineages, a better understanding of plant traits in native, non-native and hybrid lineages is needed to manage current invasions and to predict the outcome of interactions among novel genotypes. Comparative physiology and other plant functional traits may provide additional tools to predict the trajectory of current and potential future invasions.Plant invasions threaten biodiversity and ecosystem services worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C68">Vitousek <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>). Numerous studies have investigated plant invasion by comparing non-native species with closely related native congeners, and subsequently relating plant invasiveness to the differences in plant traits among the species compared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C42">McDowell 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C18">Deng <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C19">Drenovsky <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C12">Caplan and Yeakley 2013</xref>). A potential issue with this approach is that congeneric comparisons can be confounded by phylogenetic differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C23">Harvey 1996</xref>). Although not always possible, the ideal approach for assessing how strongly plant traits contribute to invasiveness would minimize phylogenetic differences, specifically by using conspecific individuals that are present in the same geographic range. In North America, multiple conspecific lineages of the common reed, <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> (hereafter <italic>Phragmites</italic>), co-exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C58">Saltonstall 2002</xref>). This provides a unique opportunity to identify the heritable traits and ecophysiological differences that may contribute to invasion success.Cosmopolitan in distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C24">Haslam 1972</xref>), <italic>P. australis</italic> is one of the most studied wetland plants due in part to its perceived benefits and threats to ecosystem services. In North America, <italic>Phragmites</italic> is often considered a nuisance species (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C32">Kiviat 2013</xref>) as invasion results in a loss of habitat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C15">Chambers <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C70">Weinstein and Balletto 1999</xref>), reductions in species richness and diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C15">Chambers <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C6">Bertness <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>) and alterations to biogeochemical cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C73">Windham and Lathrop 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C45">Meyerson <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C72">Windham and Ehrenfeld 2003</xref>). Elsewhere, <italic>Phragmites</italic> is either managed or preserved for shoreline stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C5">Benner <italic>et al</italic>. 1982</xref>), faunal habitat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C52">Poulin <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>) or building materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C25">Haslam 2010</xref>). It is also an important species in wetland-based wastewater treatment systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C69">Vymazal <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C9">Brisson and Chazarenc 2009</xref>).<italic>Phragmites australis</italic> consists of dozens of distinct genetic lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C58">Saltonstall 2002</xref>), seven of which are found in North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C58">Saltonstall 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C76">Meyerson <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). While the genus <italic>Phragmites</italic> has a history of gene flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C35">Lambertini <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>), North American genetic lineages have been geographically separated for millennia. The relatively recent introduction of the Eurasian lineage (haplotype M) most likely occurred in the 19th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C58">Saltonstall 2002</xref>). Historically, the North American native subspecies (<italic>P. australis</italic> subsp. <italic>americanus</italic>; hereafter â€˜native <italic>Phragmites</italic>â€™) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C58">Saltonstall 2002</xref>) was considered to be a minor component of both tidal and non-tidal wetlands throughout North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C39">Marks <italic>et al</italic>. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C15">Chambers <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>). The cryptic invasion of <italic>P. australis</italic> subsp<italic>. australis</italic>, or haplotype M (hereafter â€˜introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic>â€™), threatens a wide range of habitats across North America, including tidal fresh wetlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C54">Rice <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>), brackish wetlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C73">Windham and Lathrop 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C41">McCormick <italic>et al</italic>. 2010<italic>b</italic></xref>), salt marshes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C61">Silliman and Bertness 2004</xref>), fens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C56">Richburg <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>), roadside ditches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C10">Brisson <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>) and freshwater coastal wetlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C66">Tulbure <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C65">Tulbure and Johnston 2010</xref>). Recent work has also identified four additional lineages of <italic>Phragmites</italic> along the North American Gulf Coast, including a hybrid between the Gulf Coast native lineage (<italic>P. australis</italic> subsp. <italic>berlanderii</italic>) and the introduced Eurasian lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C35">Lambertini <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>).The presence of conspecific lineages of <italic>Phragmites</italic> along the Atlantic Coast of North America provides a unique opportunity to identify the heritable traits that confer success to invasive plants. Past research has demonstrated that multiple introductions of <italic>Phalaris arundinacea</italic> resulted in increased genetic variation and contributed to invasion in the introduced range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C36">Lavergne and Molofsky 2007</xref>). Earlier studies of <italic>Phragmites</italic> in Europe identified population- and/or clone-specific differences in plant phenotype and physiological traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C57">Rolletschek <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C38">Lessmann <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C22">Hansen <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). However, until recently, it was not possible to attribute these differences to a particular genetic lineage. Current molecular tools now provide a framework to assess ecological questions based on evolutionary history, potential speciation due to geographical separation and/or hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C44">Meyerson <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C35">Lambertini <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). In North America, the introduced Eurasian lineage (haplotype M) is generally considered to be invasive and responsible for the increased dominance of <italic>Phragmites</italic> throughout the North American wetlands. At the same time, native Atlantic Coast lineages are in decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C58">Saltonstall 2002</xref>). Owing to separations in flowering phenology (which limit hybridization) and lack of intermediate morphological forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C59">Saltonstall 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C60">2011</xref>), intraspecific lineages can be used to understand which plant traits may confer invasiveness.Physiological plant traits and responses to abiotic conditions can influence the spatial distribution of plants from the species to the population level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C16">Chapin and Oechel 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C53">Reich <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C36">Lavergne and Molofsky 2007</xref>). When identifying plant traits that may confer invasiveness, spurious interpretations can be avoided by restricting contrasts to those within genera or species. Previous studies have shown that differences in traits such as maximum photosynthetic rate (<italic>A</italic><sub>max</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C36">Lavergne and Molofsky 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C48">Mozdzer and Zieman 2010</xref>), specific leaf area (SLA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C42">McDowell 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C48">Mozdzer and Zieman 2010</xref>) and relative growth rate (RGR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C67">Vasquez <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>) can greatly influence the ability of a plant to be successful under a variety of environmental conditions. Here we use a literature review to identify key differences in plant ecophysiology, intraspecific competition and responses to global change factors that distinguish North American native from introduced lineages (haplotype M) of the common reed, <italic>P. australis</italic>. We also highlight areas of future research necessary to understand interactions in the field with regard to intraspecific and intrageneric competition.We reviewed the peer-reviewed literature and unpublished theses that directly compared native and introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> lineages, and conducted interviews with individuals involved in <italic>Phragmites</italic> research and management. We only included studies that focused on native and non-native lineages along the Atlantic Coast, where clear genetic differences between the lineages had been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C60">Saltonstall 2011</xref>). We excluded work prior to 2002 in our review because the native and introduced lineages were typically not differentiated prior to that date. To take into account potential differences in abiotic environment, experimental set-up and differences in propagule source (seed versus rhizome), we relativized data for each trait by calculating the per cent difference between the two lineages. This was specifically calculated as the mean trait value of the introduced lineage minus the mean trait value of the native lineage, divided by the mean trait value of the native lineage, and multiplied by 100. Positive values indicated a greater advantage to the introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> and negative values indicated a greater advantage to the native <italic>Phragmites</italic>. For data obtained from field studies we calculated mean ramet density (ramets m<sup>âˆ’2</sup>), leaf area per ramet (cm<sup>2</sup> ramet<sup>âˆ’1</sup>), ramet height and aboveground biomass (g m<sup>âˆ’2</sup>). When published data were available, we also calculated mean SLA (cm<sup>2</sup> g<sup>âˆ’1</sup>) and mean nitrogen productivity (NP; RGR per unit gram of nitrogen).Relative differences in plant trait values between North American Atlantic Coast native and Eurasian introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> in field studies. Relative difference was calculated as the mean trait value of the introduced lineage minus the mean trait value of the native lineage, divided by the mean trait value of the native lineage, and multiplied by 100.Relative differences between North American Atlantic Coast native and Eurasian introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> from manipulative experiments including common garden, transplant and greenhouse studies. Relative difference was calculated as the mean trait value of the introduced lineage minus the mean trait value of the native lineage, divided by the mean trait value of the native lineage, and multiplied by 100. <sup>a</sup>Total density including expansion tillers from this study was used in this calculation. <sup>b</sup>Means were not significantly different in the original study.Effects of salinity, N and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on relative differences between North American Atlantic Coast native and Eurasian introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> in manipulative field and greenhouse studies<italic>.</italic> Relative difference was calculated as the mean trait value of the introduced lineage minus the mean trait value of the native lineage, divided by the mean trait value of the native lineage, and multiplied by 100. <sup>a</sup>Means were not significantly different in the original study.Mean values (Â±SE) for density (A), biomass (B), culm height (C) and leaf area per culm (D) for <italic>P. australis</italic> lineages native to the North American Atlantic Coast and introduced from Eurasia.

The number of studies summarized in (A)â€“(D) was <italic>n</italic> = 3, <italic>n</italic> = 3, <italic>n</italic> = 6 and <italic>n</italic> = 2, respectively.Relative physiological differences between North American Atlantic Coast native and Eurasian introduced <italic>Phragmites.</italic> Relative difference was calculated as the mean trait value of the introduced lineage minus the mean trait value of the native lineage, divided by the mean trait value of the native lineage, and multiplied by 100. <sup>a</sup>Trait means were not significantly different in the original study. <sup>b</sup>NP was estimated from published data.Estimated CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate (A) per ramet and (B) per unit ground area of both North American Atlantic Coast native and Eurasian introduced <italic>Phragmites.</italic> Photosynthetic potentials were estimated from the mean trait values that appear in <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLT048TB1">TablesÂ 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLT048TB4">4</xref>.Only a few studies have investigated belowground differences between native and introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic>, yet trait differences associated with belowground allocation have the potential to magnify differences in growth potential. The non-native lineage had a greater ratio of belowground : aboveground biomass, allocating 46â€“89 % more biomass belowground both proportionally and in absolute terms under ambient nutrient conditions (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLT048TB2">2</xref>). The belowground : aboveground ratio was not significantly different under N treatment when plants were grown from seed (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLT048TB3">3</xref>), but when grown from rhizomes, the introduced lineage allocated 54â€“100 % more biomass belowground than did the native lineage (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLT048TB3">3</xref>). Of this belowground allocation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C47">Mozdzer and Megonigal (2012)</xref> reported that the introduced lineage allocated proportionally more biomass to both roots (root mass fraction) and rhizomes (rhizome mass fraction) than the native lineage. Thus, higher rates of nutrient acquisition and clonal expansion may come from greater resource allocation belowground to both rhizomes and roots.A study comparing the partitioning of glutamine synthetase (GS) activity, a proxy for nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) (see reviews by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C51">Oaks 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C3">Andrews <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>), demonstrated that the leaf/root partitioning of GS activity of a <italic>Phragmites</italic>-dominated habitat was the highest recorded in a natural system. Although there was no significant difference between <italic>Phragmites</italic> lineages, both had among the highest leaf/root GS activity measured in land plants, scoring higher than transgenic plants that were modified to express this trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C27">Hazelton <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>). The comparably high NUE was reflected in several studies that have shown similar vigour and assimilation of N at low concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C29">Holdredge <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C49">Mozdzer <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C47">Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012</xref>). Both lineages have higher affinities for ammonium when compared with dominant tidal wetland plants and both use multiple forms of organic N. <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> may therefore have access to a pool of nutrients that is not used by competing plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C49">Mozdzer <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>). While both lineages have high affinities for N, native <italic>Phragmites</italic> has a higher affinity for NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, but uptake rates saturate at a lower N concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C49">Mozdzer <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>). Thus, under low nutrient conditions, both lineages would be expected to perform equally well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C29">Holdredge <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C49">Mozdzer <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>). However, as anthropogenic N loading increases, the advantage clearly shifts to introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C29">Holdredge <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C49">Mozdzer <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>), as demonstrated by the greater vigour relative to the native lineage for all measured traits and metrics (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLT048TB3">3</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C47">Mozdzer and Megonigal (2012)</xref> found that only the introduced lineage, and not the native lineage of <italic>Phragmites</italic>, can alter its N metabolism to match a variety of N availability conditions. In particular, under low N availability, the introduced lineage changes plant NP, an integrative term of nutrient use efficiency, dramatically altering N metabolism to match growing conditions. In contrast, the native lineage has a nearly static NP for low-N environments. Data from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C67">Vasquez <italic>et al</italic>. (2005)</xref> study reveal the same pattern (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLT048TB4">4</xref>), with the introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> exhibiting a greater NP under ambient and high-salinity conditions.The most striking differences between the North American native and introduced lineages are when they are experimentally exposed to global change factors such as anthropogenic N pollution, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> or salinity. In particular, introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> had a greater physiological and morphological plasticity under both stressful and resource-rich conditions, resulting in its designation as a â€˜Jack-and-masterâ€™ strategist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C47">Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012</xref>). Because of this greater plasticity, introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> had a greater density with added N (85â€“168 %), salinity (873 %) and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (193â€“322 %); introduced plants are 13â€“20 % taller and have 182â€“201 % greater leaf area per ramet (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLT048TB3">3</xref>). As a consequence of increased density, height and leaf area, the introduced lineage produced anywhere from 151 to 250 % more total biomass (aboveground + belowground) (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLT048TB3">3</xref>). Of the biomass produced, the introduced lineage allocated 54â€“100 % proportionally more belowground (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLT048TB3">3</xref>).Our review confirms that introduced and native <italic>Phragmites</italic> lineages differ both physiologically and morphologically. Introduced plants are generally taller and occur in greater densities, which results in greater productivity in the introduced lineage in nearly every study. The taller and denser canopies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C43">Meadows 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C48">Mozdzer and Zieman 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C47">Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012</xref>) and thick litter layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C28">Holdredge and Bertness 2011</xref>) in stands of the introduced lineage cumulatively result in reduced light availability. The introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> may also transmit oxygen to rhizomes and roots more efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C64">Tulbure <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>), a feature that would potentially give it a belowground competitive advantage by ameliorating the anaerobic rhizosphere of saturated soils. As a consequence of its greater biomass, introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> may be more effective at immobilizing N; thus it may limit the N available to competitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C45">Meyerson <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C74">Windham and Meyerson 2003</xref>) or facilitate invasion through competitive exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C28">Holdredge and Bertness 2011</xref>).The higher ramet density of the introduced lineage, observed in both field and experimental settings, suggests differences in clonal strategies. The introduced lineage initially spreads through guerilla growth, sending out individual stolons. It then transitions to phalanx growth, resulting in the formation of dense patches that exclude other vegetation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C73">Windham and Lathrop 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C2">Amsberry <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>). In contrast, the native lineage does not always exhibit phalanx growth, as demonstrated by the fact that native <italic>Phragmites</italic> stands are interspersed with other species (E. L. G. Hazelton and V. Douhovnikoff, pers. comm.). The production of a greater number of tillers by the invasive lineage results in a higher ramet density and biomass per unit area, which thereby increases its potential for invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C29">Holdredge <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>).Given the consistent phenotypic differences in North American native populations, we hypothesize that differences in photosynthetic physiology are similar across North American native populations. We base this on the fact that the native population has lower <italic>A</italic><sub>max</sub> rates compared with the introduced population, which is due to lower chlorophyll content and lower SLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C48">Mozdzer and Zieman 2010</xref>) translating into a lower RGR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C67">Vasquez <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C47">Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012</xref>). More common garden and field studies are needed, especially across multiple populations and study sites, to validate this observation with regard to potential differences in chlorophyll content, accessory pigments and SLA.Increased light-harvesting capacity (leaf canopy per ramet) and higher growth rates (SLA and RGR) are indicative of underlying physiological strategies. In particular, the greater and plastic SLA and higher RGR of introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> have been suggested as factors driving its invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C48">Mozdzer and Zieman 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C47">Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012</xref>). Although leaf-level photosynthetic rates respond immediately to local environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C38">Lessmann <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>), traits such as SLA, which combine physiological and biochemical processes, are slower to respond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C11">Callaghan <italic>et al</italic>. 1992</xref>) and are excellent predictors of potential plant growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C13">Ceulemans 1989</xref>). While the lower SLA of the native lineage should confer some resistance to herbivory, herbivory by invertebrates seems to be greater on native populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C33">Lambert and Casagrande 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C34">Lambert <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>), suggesting that the decreased SLA did not evolve for herbivory defence. Lower SLA could be attributed to an adaptation for slower growth under nutrient-limited conditions, where plants invest more in longer-lived structures.The greater resource allocation belowground (to both rhizomes and roots) in the introduced lineage may result in both higher rates of nutrient acquisition and high rates of clonal expansion, contributing to both growth and clonal expansion. Historically, clonal integration and resource sharing were prominent hypotheses used to explain the invasiveness of introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C2">Amsberry <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>). However, given the recent findings of high within-patch genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C40">McCormick <italic>et al</italic>. 2010<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C41"><italic>b</italic></xref>), and different potential growth strategies between native and introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> (E. L. G. Hazelton and V. Douhovnikof, unpubl. data), more research is needed to conclusively determine the importance of resource sharing, and whether there are differences among native and introduced lineages. Resource sharing and a greater ability to efficiently exchange gases between aboveground and belowground organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C64">Tulbure <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>) may provide a mechanism to facilitate establishment and expansion in environments such as salt marshes that have pronounced stress gradients and limit plant distributions.Our review showed that both <italic>Phragmites</italic> lineages are adapted to N-limited environments, and that both lineages have a similar high-affinity transport system, which is an adaptation to N limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C17">Crawford and Glass 1998</xref>). However, the difference in performance under high N indicates that the introduced lineage may be shifting to a more efficient low-affinity transport system than the native lineage. The ability to respond to changing nutrient conditions has been suggested as one of the competitive advantages of the introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic>, while the native lineage becomes N saturated and is not able to exploit eutrophic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C49">Mozdzer <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>). Yet, the introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> is not at a complete disadvantage in low-N environments, due to its plastic N productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C47">Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012</xref>). These studies indicate that the vigour of introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> will increase with anthropogenic nutrient pollution, and provide evidence that the competitive ability of introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> may be linked to plastic nutrient use strategies under lower nutrient availability.Taken together, the physiological and other functional trait advantages of the introduced lineage (greater density, ramet height and biomass, higher RGR and SLA, and high N uptake under high anthropogenic N loading) are major factors driving its invasiveness in North America.The overall superior performance of introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> suggests that it would outcompete the native <italic>Phragmites</italic> in mixed populations. Indeed, the increase in abundance of introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> with the concomitant decrease in the native one at the landscape scale is often interpreted as being the result of direct competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C58">Saltonstall 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C37">Lelong <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). However, processes other than competitive exclusion may result in similar patterns. For example, a disturbance causing the removal of native <italic>Phragmites</italic> may facilitate the establishment of the introduced lineage. In such cases, better dispersal, establishment and expansion of introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic>, and not direct resource competition, would be responsible for the observed shift in relative abundance at the landscape scale.If competitive exclusion occurs, the most direct field evidence would come from the contact zone of adjoining native and introduced stands. Competitive outcomes would be revealed by the spatial dynamics at that contact zone over time as one lineage progresses to the detriment of the other. Such studies remain rare, and their results are inconclusive or contradictory. In a study in the Lac Saint-FranÃ§ois Reserve of southern Quebec, five contact zones of neighbouring stands growing in freshwater wetlands were surveyed for up to 5 years (S. de Blois <italic>et al.</italic>, unpubl. data). The survey did not reveal a clear pattern of progression of the introduced over the native lineages, or that the introduced patches were increasing over the course of the survey. Instead, there were variations in progression or regression between sites and between years, with only a slight (and non-significant) net advantage for the introduced lineage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C43">Meadows (2006)</xref> surveyed five transects crossing the contact zones in each of two cases of adjoining stands of native and introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> in Delaware. During the 2 years of the survey, there appears to have been an increase in the relative density of the native lineage over the introduced lineage in the â€˜mixedâ€™ zone of one site and a small decrease in the native lineage at the other site, although interannual changes in density for either lineage were not significant. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C43">Meadows (2006)</xref> also measured the expansion rate of adjoining stands of native and introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> located in a different Delaware site. Comparing the position of the most distant culm outside the leading edge of the stands positioned the previous year, he found that the introduced stand expanded by 1.11 m, while the adjoining native stand contracted or was displaced by 1.59 m.Classical garden or greenhouse competition experiments using seedlings or transplants, with various combinations of mixed and pure populations, represent the most direct approach to evaluate competitive interaction between two plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C21">Gibson <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C29">Holdredge <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>). We found one such study in our review; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C29">Holdredge <italic>et al</italic>. (2010)</xref> transplanted native and introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> plants to a common field, and manipulated both the identity of competitors and fertilization. Although they found no evidence of suppression of the native lineage after 2 years, their results suggest that, under high-nutrient conditions, the invasive lineage would displace the native lineage over time by producing more biomass and expanding at a faster rate.In a mesocosm competition experiment, S. de Blois <italic>et al.</italic> (unpubl. data) compared the expansion of native or introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> grown in one half of the mesocosms into the opposite, competitor-occupied half, as well as expansion into mesocosms with unoccupied (control) halves. While the absolute performance of introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> in terms of biomass and ramet density was superior to the native one under all circumstances, there was no statistical difference in the overall percentage of decrease in performance caused by the presence of the competitor. For example, expansion into the opposite compartment 1 year after a central panel was removed, as measured by aboveground biomass, was approximately 65 % lower for both subspecies in competition mesocosms compared with the control. By producing more biomass and a larger number of culms, the results nonetheless suggest that the relative competitive effect of the introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> on the native one would increase over time. Because a decline in the native lineage has been related to an increase in the introduced lineage, there is still a need for more experimental research on competition between the lineages in order to clarify the conditions that may lead to competitive exclusion.Our review finds that introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> is a â€˜Jack-and-masterâ€™ of change, which is a similar characterization to that of a super weed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C4">Baker 1965</xref>). In other words, the introduced lineage outperforms the conspecific native lineage under both stressful and resource-rich conditions. Inherently higher RGRs, greater and plastic SLA, and plastic NP are suggested to be the physiological mechanisms unique to the introduced lineage that enhance its invasive ability under current and future conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C47">Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012</xref>). More research is needed to elucidate the reasons behind the greater plasticity and ecological fitness of introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic>. Whether its plasticity and fitness are related to a history of multiple introductions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C26">Hauber <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>), hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C20">Freeland <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C44">Meyerson <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C35">Lambertini <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>) or evolution of increased competitive ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C8">Blossey and Notzold 1995</xref>) is still unclear (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C75">Guo <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). This focus area would greatly benefit from an investigation of heritable changes in gene expression via an epigenetic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C50">Nicotra <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>).Our literature survey suggested that introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> will continue to expand its range and become more abundant in response to continuing change in the global environment. In particular, anthropogenic N pollution benefits the introduced lineage; it has a stem density that is 181 % higher, produces 85â€“171 % more biomass and has ramets that are 13â€“20 % taller under elevated N (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLT048TB3">3</xref>). In addition, N had profound effects on the introduced lineage by producing a canopy with 200 % greater photosynthetic area (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLT048TB3">3</xref>). These differences in growth can be attributed to the greater N uptake capacity of the introduced lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C49">Mozdzer <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>) coupled to a greater allocation belowground for nutrient acquisition (TablesÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLT048TB2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLT048TB3">3</xref>). Plastic NP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C47">Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012</xref>) may be the underlying cause for the disproportionate response under current and predicted N availabilities. This is congruent with correlations of introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> expansion throughout New England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C6">Bertness <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>) and Chesapeake Bay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C31">King <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C14">Chambers <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>) with anthropogenic N pollution.As C<sub>3</sub> plants, both <italic>Phragmites</italic> lineages should benefit from elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C1">Ainsworth and Long 2005</xref>). In growth chamber experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C47">Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012</xref>), both lineages responded positively to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. However, the introduced lineage had the greatest biomass response to CO<sub>2</sub>, which was about 45 % greater than the control treatment. This suggests, but does not demonstrate, that it is likely that elevated CO<sub>2</sub> will also favour the introduced genetic lineage in the field. Elsewhere, only a handful of studies have investigated CO<sub>2</sub> responses in <italic>Phragmites.</italic> Neither the growth chamber study on <italic>Phragmites japonica</italic> or <italic>Phragmites communis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C30">Kim and Kang 2008</xref>) nor field experiments with <italic>Phragmites</italic> within a <italic>Sphagnum</italic> peatland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C46">Milla <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>) demonstrated any significant effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on <italic>Phragmites</italic> growth. It is most likely that the elevated CO<sub>2</sub> growth response in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C30">Kim and Kang's (2008)</xref> study was limited by pot volume, which is a well-documented phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C63">Thomas and Strain 1991</xref>). A mini-FACE experiment in Europe by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C46">Milla <italic>et al</italic>. (2006)</xref> concluded that vascular plants in peatlands, including <italic>Phragmites</italic>, are not very responsive to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. The lack of CO<sub>2</sub> response by <italic>Phragmites</italic> in the mini-FACE study was likely attributable to the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration at the position of the tall <italic>Phragmites</italic> canopy being close to ambient levels and/or a combination of nutrient limitation and immobilization by the <italic>Sphagnum</italic> layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C46">Milla <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>). Alternatively, it is also possible that the introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> lineages in North America are physiologically different from those in Eurasia.In short-term studies, rising CO<sub>2</sub> and anthropogenic N pollution seem to benefit the introduced lineage with respect to both expansion and establishment. In particular, the introduced lineage outperformed the native lineage for every measurable metric (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLT048TB4">4</xref>); the introduced lineage exhibited a more plastic NP and SLA and an inherently higher RGR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C56">Richburg <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>) The introduced lineage also exhibits a â€˜Jack-and-masterâ€™ phenotypic and physiological plasticity (<italic>sensu</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C55">Richards <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>), suggesting that it had greater ecological fitness under both stressful and resource-rich conditions. These results suggest that the introduced lineage will only become more competitive in the future.Given the high genetic diversity within native and introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C40">McCormick <italic>et al</italic>. 2010<italic>a</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C60">Saltonstall 2011</xref>), the underlying question is what caused the introduced lineage to become so invasive in North America? Our review clearly identifies gaps in our knowledge. Additional studies are needed to determine whether there has been an evolution of increased competitive ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C8">Blossey and Notzold 1995</xref>) given potential physiological differences between North American and Eurasian populations. An alternative explanation is that there has been gene flow among North American native and introduced populations that made the introduced lineage more invasive and/or plastic than it is outside of North America. Given the amount of gene flow recently demonstrated in Gulf Coast populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C60">Saltonstall 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C35">Lambertini <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>), and the discovery of new genetic lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT048C35">Lambertini <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>), this possibility should be further evaluated.Finally, our review shows that direct studies of competitive interactions between the native and the introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> are few, and that conclusions from the laboratory and field observations do not always concur. The assumed superiority of introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic> does not necessarily hold in mixed or adjoining populations under pristine conditions, and inconclusive or even opposing results have occasionally been observed. Certainly, more experiments or surveys of adjoining populations are necessary to examine how physiological and morphological characteristics translate into a competitive advantage of the introduced lineage over the native <italic>Phragmites</italic> when they are naturally co-occurring. Acknowledging the disconnect between laboratory and field observations, we still observe profound differences in response to global change factors such as CO<sub>2</sub> and N pollution. Thus, our analysis of comparative ecophysiology and functional traits allows us to predict its likely trajectory. Given the differential response of native and introduced <italic>Phragmites</italic>, we hypothesize that the competitive advantage will shift to more strongly favour the introduced lineage, especially when competition is coupled with anthropogenic N pollution and rising CO<sub>2</sub>.This manuscript is an outcome of a <italic>Phragmites</italic> symposium at the 2011 meeting of the Society of Wetland Scientists with travel funding provided by <grant-sponsor xlink:type="simple"><italic>AoB PLANTS</italic> to both T.J.M. and E.L.G.H.</grant-sponsor> Funding support for T.J.M. was provided from MD Sea Grant Award <grant-num xlink:type="simple">SA7528114-WW</grant-num> and <grant-num xlink:type="simple">NSF DEB-0950080</grant-num>.
