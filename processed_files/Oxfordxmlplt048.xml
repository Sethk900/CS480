Biological invasion pose serious threats to biodiversity and ecosystem services worldwide. While the effects of invasive species are well-documents, less is known about which specific plant traits convey â€œinvasivenessâ€ because most studies compare closely related, but different species which can confound results. A review of the literature by Mozdzer and other scientists compared genetic lineages of the same species, those native to North American and a lineage introduced from Europe to address this complex issue. The authors found that the ability to change both physiologically and morphologically were the key to success of the introduced genetic lineage under current and predicted global change conditions.  Physiological ecology and plant functional traits are often used to explain plant invasion. To gain a better understanding of how traits influence invasion, studies usually compare the invasive plant to a native congener, but there are few conspecific examples in the literature. In North America, the presence of native and introduced genetic lineages of the common reed,  Phragmites australis , presents a unique example to evaluate how traits influence plant invasion. We reviewed the literature on functional traits of  P. australis  lineages in North America, specifically contrasting lineages present on the Atlantic Coast. We focused on differences in physiology between the lineage introduced from Eurasia and the lineage native to North America, specifically seeking to identify the causes underlying the recent expansion of the introduced lineage. Our goals were to better understand which traits may confer invasiveness, provide predictions of how these lineages may respond to interspecific competition or imminent global change, and provide guidance for future research. We reviewed published studies and articles in press, and conducted personal communications with appropriate researchers and managers to develop a comparative dataset. We compared the native and introduced lineages and focused on plant physiological ecology and functional traits. Under both stressful and favourable conditions, our review showed that introduced  P. australis  consistently exhibited greater ramet density, height and biomass, higher and more plastic relative growth rate, nitrogen productivity and specific leaf area, higher mass specific nitrogen uptake rates, as well as greater phenotypic plasticity compared with the native lineage. We suggest that ecophysiological and other plant functional traits elucidate potential mechanisms for the introduced lineage's invasiveness under current and predicted global change conditions. However, our review identified a disconnect between field surveys, experiments, natural competition and plant ecophysiology that must be addressed in future field studies. Given the likelihood of hybridization between lineages, a better understanding of plant traits in native, non-native and hybrid lineages is needed to manage current invasions and to predict the outcome of interactions among novel genotypes. Comparative physiology and other plant functional traits may provide additional tools to predict the trajectory of current and potential future invasions.  Plant invasions threaten biodiversity and ecosystem services worldwide ( Vitousek  et al . 1997 ). Numerous studies have investigated plant invasion by comparing non-native species with closely related native congeners, and subsequently relating plant invasiveness to the differences in plant traits among the species compared ( McDowell 2002 ;  Deng  et al . 2004 ;  Drenovsky  et al . 2012 ;  Caplan and Yeakley 2013 ). A potential issue with this approach is that congeneric comparisons can be confounded by phylogenetic differences ( Harvey 1996 ). Although not always possible, the ideal approach for assessing how strongly plant traits contribute to invasiveness would minimize phylogenetic differences, specifically by using conspecific individuals that are present in the same geographic range. In North America, multiple conspecific lineages of the common reed,  Phragmites australis  (hereafter  Phragmites ), co-exist ( Saltonstall 2002 ). This provides a unique opportunity to identify the heritable traits and ecophysiological differences that may contribute to invasion success.  Cosmopolitan in distribution ( Haslam 1972 ),  P. australis  is one of the most studied wetland plants due in part to its perceived benefits and threats to ecosystem services. In North America,  Phragmites  is often considered a nuisance species (but see  Kiviat 2013 ) as invasion results in a loss of habitat ( Chambers  et al . 1999 ;  Weinstein and Balletto 1999 ), reductions in species richness and diversity ( Chambers  et al . 1999 ;  Bertness  et al . 2002 ) and alterations to biogeochemical cycles ( Windham and Lathrop 1999 ;  Meyerson  et al . 2000 ;  Windham and Ehrenfeld 2003 ). Elsewhere,  Phragmites  is either managed or preserved for shoreline stabilization ( Benner  et al . 1982 ), faunal habitat ( Poulin  et al . 2002 ) or building materials ( Haslam 2010 ). It is also an important species in wetland-based wastewater treatment systems ( Vymazal  et al . 2006 ;  Brisson and Chazarenc 2009 ).   Phragmites australis  consists of dozens of distinct genetic lineages ( Saltonstall 2002 ), seven of which are found in North America ( Saltonstall 2002 ;  Meyerson  et al.  2012 ). While the genus  Phragmites  has a history of gene flow ( Lambertini  et al . 2012 ), North American genetic lineages have been geographically separated for millennia. The relatively recent introduction of the Eurasian lineage (haplotype M) most likely occurred in the 19th century ( Saltonstall 2002 ). Historically, the North American native subspecies ( P. australis  subsp.  americanus ; hereafter â€˜native  Phragmites â€™) ( Saltonstall 2002 ) was considered to be a minor component of both tidal and non-tidal wetlands throughout North America ( Marks  et al . 1994 ;  Chambers  et al . 1999 ). The cryptic invasion of  P. australis  subsp . australis , or haplotype M (hereafter â€˜introduced  Phragmites â€™), threatens a wide range of habitats across North America, including tidal fresh wetlands ( Rice  et al . 2000 ), brackish wetlands ( Windham and Lathrop 1999 ;  McCormick  et al . 2010 b  ), salt marshes ( Silliman and Bertness 2004 ), fens ( Richburg  et al . 2001 ), roadside ditches ( Brisson  et al . 2010 ) and freshwater coastal wetlands ( Tulbure  et al . 2007 ;  Tulbure and Johnston 2010 ). Recent work has also identified four additional lineages of  Phragmites  along the North American Gulf Coast, including a hybrid between the Gulf Coast native lineage ( P. australis  subsp.  berlanderii ) and the introduced Eurasian lineage ( Lambertini  et al . 2012 ).  The presence of conspecific lineages of  Phragmites  along the Atlantic Coast of North America provides a unique opportunity to identify the heritable traits that confer success to invasive plants. Past research has demonstrated that multiple introductions of  Phalaris arundinacea  resulted in increased genetic variation and contributed to invasion in the introduced range ( Lavergne and Molofsky 2007 ). Earlier studies of  Phragmites  in Europe identified population- and/or clone-specific differences in plant phenotype and physiological traits ( Rolletschek  et al . 1999 ;  Lessmann  et al . 2001 ;  Hansen  et al . 2007 ). However, until recently, it was not possible to attribute these differences to a particular genetic lineage. Current molecular tools now provide a framework to assess ecological questions based on evolutionary history, potential speciation due to geographical separation and/or hybridization ( Meyerson  et al . 2010 ;  Lambertini  et al . 2012 ). In North America, the introduced Eurasian lineage (haplotype M) is generally considered to be invasive and responsible for the increased dominance of  Phragmites  throughout the North American wetlands. At the same time, native Atlantic Coast lineages are in decline ( Saltonstall 2002 ). Owing to separations in flowering phenology (which limit hybridization) and lack of intermediate morphological forms ( Saltonstall 2003 ,  2011 ), intraspecific lineages can be used to understand which plant traits may confer invasiveness.  Physiological plant traits and responses to abiotic conditions can influence the spatial distribution of plants from the species to the population level ( Chapin and Oechel 1983 ;  Reich  et al . 1999 ;  Lavergne and Molofsky 2007 ). When identifying plant traits that may confer invasiveness, spurious interpretations can be avoided by restricting contrasts to those within genera or species. Previous studies have shown that differences in traits such as maximum photosynthetic rate ( A  max ) ( Lavergne and Molofsky 2007 ;  Mozdzer and Zieman 2010 ), specific leaf area (SLA) ( McDowell 2002 ;  Mozdzer and Zieman 2010 ) and relative growth rate (RGR) ( Vasquez  et al . 2005 ) can greatly influence the ability of a plant to be successful under a variety of environmental conditions. Here we use a literature review to identify key differences in plant ecophysiology, intraspecific competition and responses to global change factors that distinguish North American native from introduced lineages (haplotype M) of the common reed,  P. australis . We also highlight areas of future research necessary to understand interactions in the field with regard to intraspecific and intrageneric competition.  We reviewed the peer-reviewed literature and unpublished theses that directly compared native and introduced  Phragmites  lineages, and conducted interviews with individuals involved in  Phragmites  research and management. We only included studies that focused on native and non-native lineages along the Atlantic Coast, where clear genetic differences between the lineages had been demonstrated ( Saltonstall 2011 ). We excluded work prior to 2002 in our review because the native and introduced lineages were typically not differentiated prior to that date. To take into account potential differences in abiotic environment, experimental set-up and differences in propagule source (seed versus rhizome), we relativized data for each trait by calculating the per cent difference between the two lineages. This was specifically calculated as the mean trait value of the introduced lineage minus the mean trait value of the native lineage, divided by the mean trait value of the native lineage, and multiplied by 100. Positive values indicated a greater advantage to the introduced  Phragmites  and negative values indicated a greater advantage to the native  Phragmites . For data obtained from field studies we calculated mean ramet density (ramets m âˆ’2 ), leaf area per ramet (cm 2  ramet âˆ’1 ), ramet height and aboveground biomass (g m âˆ’2 ). When published data were available, we also calculated mean SLA (cm 2  g âˆ’1 ) and mean nitrogen productivity (NP; RGR per unit gram of nitrogen).  Relative differences in plant trait values between North American Atlantic Coast native and Eurasian introduced  Phragmites  in field studies. Relative difference was calculated as the mean trait value of the introduced lineage minus the mean trait value of the native lineage, divided by the mean trait value of the native lineage, and multiplied by 100.  Relative differences between North American Atlantic Coast native and Eurasian introduced  Phragmites  from manipulative experiments including common garden, transplant and greenhouse studies. Relative difference was calculated as the mean trait value of the introduced lineage minus the mean trait value of the native lineage, divided by the mean trait value of the native lineage, and multiplied by 100.  a Total density including expansion tillers from this study was used in this calculation.  b Means were not significantly different in the original study.  Effects of salinity, N and elevated CO 2  on relative differences between North American Atlantic Coast native and Eurasian introduced  Phragmites  in manipulative field and greenhouse studies .  Relative difference was calculated as the mean trait value of the introduced lineage minus the mean trait value of the native lineage, divided by the mean trait value of the native lineage, and multiplied by 100.  a Means were not significantly different in the original study.  Mean values (Â±SE) for density (A), biomass (B), culm height (C) and leaf area per culm (D) for  P. australis  lineages native to the North American Atlantic Coast and introduced from Eurasia. All data come from naturally occurring ecosystems. Mean values and standard errors were calculated from the studies that appear in  TableÂ 1 . The number of studies summarized in (A)â€“(D) was  n  = 3,  n  = 3,  n  = 6 and  n  = 2, respectively.  Relative physiological differences between North American Atlantic Coast native and Eurasian introduced  Phragmites.  Relative difference was calculated as the mean trait value of the introduced lineage minus the mean trait value of the native lineage, divided by the mean trait value of the native lineage, and multiplied by 100.  a Trait means were not significantly different in the original study.  b NP was estimated from published data.  Estimated CO 2  assimilation rate (A) per ramet and (B) per unit ground area of both North American Atlantic Coast native and Eurasian introduced  Phragmites.  Photosynthetic potentials were estimated from the mean trait values that appear in  TablesÂ 1  and  4 .  Only a few studies have investigated belowground differences between native and introduced  Phragmites , yet trait differences associated with belowground allocation have the potential to magnify differences in growth potential. The non-native lineage had a greater ratio of belowground : aboveground biomass, allocating 46â€“89 % more biomass belowground both proportionally and in absolute terms under ambient nutrient conditions (TableÂ  2 ). The belowground : aboveground ratio was not significantly different under N treatment when plants were grown from seed (TableÂ  3 ), but when grown from rhizomes, the introduced lineage allocated 54â€“100 % more biomass belowground than did the native lineage (TableÂ  3 ). Of this belowground allocation,  Mozdzer and Megonigal (2012)  reported that the introduced lineage allocated proportionally more biomass to both roots (root mass fraction) and rhizomes (rhizome mass fraction) than the native lineage. Thus, higher rates of nutrient acquisition and clonal expansion may come from greater resource allocation belowground to both rhizomes and roots.  A study comparing the partitioning of glutamine synthetase (GS) activity, a proxy for nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) (see reviews by  Oaks 1992 ;  Andrews  et al . 2004 ), demonstrated that the leaf/root partitioning of GS activity of a  Phragmites -dominated habitat was the highest recorded in a natural system. Although there was no significant difference between  Phragmites  lineages, both had among the highest leaf/root GS activity measured in land plants, scoring higher than transgenic plants that were modified to express this trait ( Hazelton  et al . 2010 ). The comparably high NUE was reflected in several studies that have shown similar vigour and assimilation of N at low concentrations ( Holdredge  et al . 2010 ;  Mozdzer  et al . 2010 ;  Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012 ). Both lineages have higher affinities for ammonium when compared with dominant tidal wetland plants and both use multiple forms of organic N.  Phragmites australis  may therefore have access to a pool of nutrients that is not used by competing plants ( Mozdzer  et al . 2010 ). While both lineages have high affinities for N, native  Phragmites  has a higher affinity for NH 4  + , but uptake rates saturate at a lower N concentration ( Mozdzer  et al . 2010 ). Thus, under low nutrient conditions, both lineages would be expected to perform equally well ( Holdredge  et al . 2010 ;  Mozdzer  et al . 2010 ). However, as anthropogenic N loading increases, the advantage clearly shifts to introduced  Phragmites  ( Holdredge  et al . 2010 ;  Mozdzer  et al . 2010 ), as demonstrated by the greater vigour relative to the native lineage for all measured traits and metrics (TableÂ  3 ).   Mozdzer and Megonigal (2012)  found that only the introduced lineage, and not the native lineage of  Phragmites , can alter its N metabolism to match a variety of N availability conditions. In particular, under low N availability, the introduced lineage changes plant NP, an integrative term of nutrient use efficiency, dramatically altering N metabolism to match growing conditions. In contrast, the native lineage has a nearly static NP for low-N environments. Data from the  Vasquez  et al . (2005)  study reveal the same pattern (TableÂ  4 ), with the introduced  Phragmites  exhibiting a greater NP under ambient and high-salinity conditions.  The most striking differences between the North American native and introduced lineages are when they are experimentally exposed to global change factors such as anthropogenic N pollution, elevated CO 2  or salinity. In particular, introduced  Phragmites  had a greater physiological and morphological plasticity under both stressful and resource-rich conditions, resulting in its designation as a â€˜Jack-and-masterâ€™ strategist ( Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012 ). Because of this greater plasticity, introduced  Phragmites  had a greater density with added N (85â€“168 %), salinity (873 %) and elevated CO 2  (193â€“322 %); introduced plants are 13â€“20 % taller and have 182â€“201 % greater leaf area per ramet (TableÂ  3 ). As a consequence of increased density, height and leaf area, the introduced lineage produced anywhere from 151 to 250 % more total biomass (aboveground + belowground) (TableÂ  3 ). Of the biomass produced, the introduced lineage allocated 54â€“100 % proportionally more belowground (TableÂ  3 ).  Our review confirms that introduced and native  Phragmites  lineages differ both physiologically and morphologically. Introduced plants are generally taller and occur in greater densities, which results in greater productivity in the introduced lineage in nearly every study. The taller and denser canopies ( Meadows 2006 ;  Mozdzer and Zieman 2010 ;  Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012 ) and thick litter layer ( Holdredge and Bertness 2011 ) in stands of the introduced lineage cumulatively result in reduced light availability. The introduced  Phragmites  may also transmit oxygen to rhizomes and roots more efficiently ( Tulbure  et al . 2012 ), a feature that would potentially give it a belowground competitive advantage by ameliorating the anaerobic rhizosphere of saturated soils. As a consequence of its greater biomass, introduced  Phragmites  may be more effective at immobilizing N; thus it may limit the N available to competitors ( Meyerson  et al . 2000 ;  Windham and Meyerson 2003 ) or facilitate invasion through competitive exclusion ( Holdredge and Bertness 2011 ).  The higher ramet density of the introduced lineage, observed in both field and experimental settings, suggests differences in clonal strategies. The introduced lineage initially spreads through guerilla growth, sending out individual stolons. It then transitions to phalanx growth, resulting in the formation of dense patches that exclude other vegetation ( Windham and Lathrop 1999 ;  Amsberry  et al . 2000 ). In contrast, the native lineage does not always exhibit phalanx growth, as demonstrated by the fact that native  Phragmites  stands are interspersed with other species (E. L. G. Hazelton and V. Douhovnikoff, pers. comm.). The production of a greater number of tillers by the invasive lineage results in a higher ramet density and biomass per unit area, which thereby increases its potential for invasion ( Holdredge  et al . 2010 ).  Given the consistent phenotypic differences in North American native populations, we hypothesize that differences in photosynthetic physiology are similar across North American native populations. We base this on the fact that the native population has lower  A  max  rates compared with the introduced population, which is due to lower chlorophyll content and lower SLA ( Mozdzer and Zieman 2010 ) translating into a lower RGR ( Vasquez  et al . 2005 ;  Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012 ). More common garden and field studies are needed, especially across multiple populations and study sites, to validate this observation with regard to potential differences in chlorophyll content, accessory pigments and SLA.  Increased light-harvesting capacity (leaf canopy per ramet) and higher growth rates (SLA and RGR) are indicative of underlying physiological strategies. In particular, the greater and plastic SLA and higher RGR of introduced  Phragmites  have been suggested as factors driving its invasion ( Mozdzer and Zieman 2010 ;  Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012 ). Although leaf-level photosynthetic rates respond immediately to local environmental conditions ( Lessmann  et al . 2001 ), traits such as SLA, which combine physiological and biochemical processes, are slower to respond ( Callaghan  et al . 1992 ) and are excellent predictors of potential plant growth ( Ceulemans 1989 ). While the lower SLA of the native lineage should confer some resistance to herbivory, herbivory by invertebrates seems to be greater on native populations ( Lambert and Casagrande 2007 ;  Lambert  et al . 2007 ), suggesting that the decreased SLA did not evolve for herbivory defence. Lower SLA could be attributed to an adaptation for slower growth under nutrient-limited conditions, where plants invest more in longer-lived structures.  The greater resource allocation belowground (to both rhizomes and roots) in the introduced lineage may result in both higher rates of nutrient acquisition and high rates of clonal expansion, contributing to both growth and clonal expansion. Historically, clonal integration and resource sharing were prominent hypotheses used to explain the invasiveness of introduced  Phragmites  ( Amsberry  et al . 2000 ). However, given the recent findings of high within-patch genetic diversity ( McCormick  et al . 2010 a  ,   b  ), and different potential growth strategies between native and introduced  Phragmites  (E. L. G. Hazelton and V. Douhovnikof, unpubl. data), more research is needed to conclusively determine the importance of resource sharing, and whether there are differences among native and introduced lineages. Resource sharing and a greater ability to efficiently exchange gases between aboveground and belowground organs ( Tulbure  et al . 2012 ) may provide a mechanism to facilitate establishment and expansion in environments such as salt marshes that have pronounced stress gradients and limit plant distributions.  Our review showed that both  Phragmites  lineages are adapted to N-limited environments, and that both lineages have a similar high-affinity transport system, which is an adaptation to N limitation ( Crawford and Glass 1998 ). However, the difference in performance under high N indicates that the introduced lineage may be shifting to a more efficient low-affinity transport system than the native lineage. The ability to respond to changing nutrient conditions has been suggested as one of the competitive advantages of the introduced  Phragmites , while the native lineage becomes N saturated and is not able to exploit eutrophic conditions ( Mozdzer  et al . 2010 ). Yet, the introduced  Phragmites  is not at a complete disadvantage in low-N environments, due to its plastic N productivity ( Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012 ). These studies indicate that the vigour of introduced  Phragmites  will increase with anthropogenic nutrient pollution, and provide evidence that the competitive ability of introduced  Phragmites  may be linked to plastic nutrient use strategies under lower nutrient availability.  Taken together, the physiological and other functional trait advantages of the introduced lineage (greater density, ramet height and biomass, higher RGR and SLA, and high N uptake under high anthropogenic N loading) are major factors driving its invasiveness in North America.  The overall superior performance of introduced  Phragmites  suggests that it would outcompete the native  Phragmites  in mixed populations. Indeed, the increase in abundance of introduced  Phragmites  with the concomitant decrease in the native one at the landscape scale is often interpreted as being the result of direct competition ( Saltonstall 2002 ;  Lelong  et al . 2007 ). However, processes other than competitive exclusion may result in similar patterns. For example, a disturbance causing the removal of native  Phragmites  may facilitate the establishment of the introduced lineage. In such cases, better dispersal, establishment and expansion of introduced  Phragmites , and not direct resource competition, would be responsible for the observed shift in relative abundance at the landscape scale.  If competitive exclusion occurs, the most direct field evidence would come from the contact zone of adjoining native and introduced stands. Competitive outcomes would be revealed by the spatial dynamics at that contact zone over time as one lineage progresses to the detriment of the other. Such studies remain rare, and their results are inconclusive or contradictory. In a study in the Lac Saint-FranÃ§ois Reserve of southern Quebec, five contact zones of neighbouring stands growing in freshwater wetlands were surveyed for up to 5 years (S. de Blois  et al. , unpubl. data). The survey did not reveal a clear pattern of progression of the introduced over the native lineages, or that the introduced patches were increasing over the course of the survey. Instead, there were variations in progression or regression between sites and between years, with only a slight (and non-significant) net advantage for the introduced lineage.  Meadows (2006)  surveyed five transects crossing the contact zones in each of two cases of adjoining stands of native and introduced  Phragmites  in Delaware. During the 2 years of the survey, there appears to have been an increase in the relative density of the native lineage over the introduced lineage in the â€˜mixedâ€™ zone of one site and a small decrease in the native lineage at the other site, although interannual changes in density for either lineage were not significant.  Meadows (2006)  also measured the expansion rate of adjoining stands of native and introduced  Phragmites  located in a different Delaware site. Comparing the position of the most distant culm outside the leading edge of the stands positioned the previous year, he found that the introduced stand expanded by 1.11 m, while the adjoining native stand contracted or was displaced by 1.59 m.  Classical garden or greenhouse competition experiments using seedlings or transplants, with various combinations of mixed and pure populations, represent the most direct approach to evaluate competitive interaction between two plant species ( Gibson  et al . 1999 ;  Holdredge  et al . 2010 ). We found one such study in our review;  Holdredge  et al . (2010)  transplanted native and introduced  Phragmites  plants to a common field, and manipulated both the identity of competitors and fertilization. Although they found no evidence of suppression of the native lineage after 2 years, their results suggest that, under high-nutrient conditions, the invasive lineage would displace the native lineage over time by producing more biomass and expanding at a faster rate.  In a mesocosm competition experiment, S. de Blois  et al.  (unpubl. data) compared the expansion of native or introduced  Phragmites  grown in one half of the mesocosms into the opposite, competitor-occupied half, as well as expansion into mesocosms with unoccupied (control) halves. While the absolute performance of introduced  Phragmites  in terms of biomass and ramet density was superior to the native one under all circumstances, there was no statistical difference in the overall percentage of decrease in performance caused by the presence of the competitor. For example, expansion into the opposite compartment 1 year after a central panel was removed, as measured by aboveground biomass, was approximately 65 % lower for both subspecies in competition mesocosms compared with the control. By producing more biomass and a larger number of culms, the results nonetheless suggest that the relative competitive effect of the introduced  Phragmites  on the native one would increase over time. Because a decline in the native lineage has been related to an increase in the introduced lineage, there is still a need for more experimental research on competition between the lineages in order to clarify the conditions that may lead to competitive exclusion.  Our review finds that introduced  Phragmites  is a â€˜Jack-and-masterâ€™ of change, which is a similar characterization to that of a super weed ( Baker 1965 ). In other words, the introduced lineage outperforms the conspecific native lineage under both stressful and resource-rich conditions. Inherently higher RGRs, greater and plastic SLA, and plastic NP are suggested to be the physiological mechanisms unique to the introduced lineage that enhance its invasive ability under current and future conditions ( Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012 ). More research is needed to elucidate the reasons behind the greater plasticity and ecological fitness of introduced  Phragmites . Whether its plasticity and fitness are related to a history of multiple introductions ( Hauber  et al . 2011 ), hybridization ( Freeland  et al . 2010 ;  Meyerson  et al . 2010 ;  Lambertini  et al . 2012 ) or evolution of increased competitive ability ( Blossey and Notzold 1995 ) is still unclear (but see  Guo  et al.  2013 ). This focus area would greatly benefit from an investigation of heritable changes in gene expression via an epigenetic approach ( Nicotra  et al . 2010 ).  Our literature survey suggested that introduced  Phragmites  will continue to expand its range and become more abundant in response to continuing change in the global environment. In particular, anthropogenic N pollution benefits the introduced lineage; it has a stem density that is 181 % higher, produces 85â€“171 % more biomass and has ramets that are 13â€“20 % taller under elevated N (TableÂ  3 ). In addition, N had profound effects on the introduced lineage by producing a canopy with 200 % greater photosynthetic area (TableÂ  3 ). These differences in growth can be attributed to the greater N uptake capacity of the introduced lineage ( Mozdzer  et al . 2010 ) coupled to a greater allocation belowground for nutrient acquisition (TablesÂ  2  and  3 ). Plastic NP ( Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012 ) may be the underlying cause for the disproportionate response under current and predicted N availabilities. This is congruent with correlations of introduced  Phragmites  expansion throughout New England ( Bertness  et al . 2002 ) and Chesapeake Bay ( King  et al . 2007 ;  Chambers  et al . 2008 ) with anthropogenic N pollution.  As C 3  plants, both  Phragmites  lineages should benefit from elevated CO 2  ( Ainsworth and Long 2005 ). In growth chamber experiments ( Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012 ), both lineages responded positively to elevated CO 2 . However, the introduced lineage had the greatest biomass response to CO 2 , which was about 45 % greater than the control treatment. This suggests, but does not demonstrate, that it is likely that elevated CO 2  will also favour the introduced genetic lineage in the field. Elsewhere, only a handful of studies have investigated CO 2  responses in  Phragmites.  Neither the growth chamber study on  Phragmites japonica  or  Phragmites communis  ( Kim and Kang 2008 ) nor field experiments with  Phragmites  within a  Sphagnum  peatland ( Milla  et al . 2006 ) demonstrated any significant effects of elevated CO 2  on  Phragmites  growth. It is most likely that the elevated CO 2  growth response in  Kim and Kang's (2008)  study was limited by pot volume, which is a well-documented phenomenon ( Thomas and Strain 1991 ). A mini-FACE experiment in Europe by  Milla  et al . (2006)  concluded that vascular plants in peatlands, including  Phragmites , are not very responsive to elevated CO 2 . The lack of CO 2  response by  Phragmites  in the mini-FACE study was likely attributable to the CO 2  concentration at the position of the tall  Phragmites  canopy being close to ambient levels and/or a combination of nutrient limitation and immobilization by the  Sphagnum  layer ( Milla  et al . 2006 ). Alternatively, it is also possible that the introduced  Phragmites  lineages in North America are physiologically different from those in Eurasia.  In short-term studies, rising CO 2  and anthropogenic N pollution seem to benefit the introduced lineage with respect to both expansion and establishment. In particular, the introduced lineage outperformed the native lineage for every measurable metric (TableÂ  4 ); the introduced lineage exhibited a more plastic NP and SLA and an inherently higher RGR ( Richburg  et al . 2001 ) The introduced lineage also exhibits a â€˜Jack-and-masterâ€™ phenotypic and physiological plasticity ( sensu   Richards  et al . 2006 ), suggesting that it had greater ecological fitness under both stressful and resource-rich conditions. These results suggest that the introduced lineage will only become more competitive in the future.  Given the high genetic diversity within native and introduced  Phragmites  populations ( McCormick  et al . 2010 a  ;  Saltonstall 2011 ), the underlying question is what caused the introduced lineage to become so invasive in North America? Our review clearly identifies gaps in our knowledge. Additional studies are needed to determine whether there has been an evolution of increased competitive ability ( Blossey and Notzold 1995 ) given potential physiological differences between North American and Eurasian populations. An alternative explanation is that there has been gene flow among North American native and introduced populations that made the introduced lineage more invasive and/or plastic than it is outside of North America. Given the amount of gene flow recently demonstrated in Gulf Coast populations ( Saltonstall 2011 ;  Lambertini  et al . 2012 ), and the discovery of new genetic lineages ( Lambertini  et al . 2012 ), this possibility should be further evaluated.  Finally, our review shows that direct studies of competitive interactions between the native and the introduced  Phragmites  are few, and that conclusions from the laboratory and field observations do not always concur. The assumed superiority of introduced  Phragmites  does not necessarily hold in mixed or adjoining populations under pristine conditions, and inconclusive or even opposing results have occasionally been observed. Certainly, more experiments or surveys of adjoining populations are necessary to examine how physiological and morphological characteristics translate into a competitive advantage of the introduced lineage over the native  Phragmites  when they are naturally co-occurring. Acknowledging the disconnect between laboratory and field observations, we still observe profound differences in response to global change factors such as CO 2  and N pollution. Thus, our analysis of comparative ecophysiology and functional traits allows us to predict its likely trajectory. Given the differential response of native and introduced  Phragmites , we hypothesize that the competitive advantage will shift to more strongly favour the introduced lineage, especially when competition is coupled with anthropogenic N pollution and rising CO 2 .
