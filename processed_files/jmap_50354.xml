A revision of chromosome II (CD) mapping in Chironomus plumosus (Linnaeus, 1758) group (Diptera,Â Chironomidae)A revision of the main and alternative banding sequences in chromosome II (CD) has been made for all 14 species of the Chironomus plumosus (Linnaeus, 1758)group. A new version of mapping has been suggested for 10 out of 18 banding sequences of arm C and 12 out of 22 banding sequences of arm D. Mapping of 7 banding sequences has been done for the first time according to the Keyl-Devai system. Phylogenetic relationships of banding sequences of chromosome II have been discussed.
