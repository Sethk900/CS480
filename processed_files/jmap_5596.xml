Redescription of the genus Noteochordodes, reinterpretation of Noteochordodes dugesi (Camerano, 1898), a new combination of Neochordodes talensis (Camerano, 1897) and a description of a new speciesThree species of the freshwater genus Noteochordodes (Nematomorpha) have been reported from Argentina. In this reinvestigation Neochordodes talensis is included into Noteochordodes on the basis of its cuticular structure. The ultrastructural study of the holotype of N. dugesi showed features which are correspondent with the genus Pseudochordodes. Consequently, some specimens formerly assigned to this species have been assigned to a new species, Noteochordoeds cymatium. Another new species, Noteochordodes achosmosus is also described. Therefore, we regard five species to be valid for the genus Noteochordodes: N. achosmosus, N. cymatium, N. desantisi, N. talensis and N. saltae.
