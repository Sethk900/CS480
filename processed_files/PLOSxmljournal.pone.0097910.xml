Decision-makers need to know which of the remaining forests to prioritize for conservation, but the only spatial information on forest biodiversity has, until recently, come from a sparse network of ground-based plots. Here we explore whether airborne hyperspectral imagery can be used to predict the alpha diversity of upper canopy trees in a West African forest. The abundance of tree species were collected from 64 plots (each 1250 m<sup>2</sup> in size) within a Sierra Leonean national park, and Shannon-Wiener biodiversity indices were calculated. An airborne spectrometer measured reflectances of 186 bands in the visible and near-infrared spectral range at 1 m<sup>2</sup> resolution. The standard deviations of these reflectance values and their first-order derivatives were calculated for each plot from the c. 1250 pixels of hyperspectral information within them. Shannon-Wiener indices were then predicted from these plot-based reflectance statistics using a machine-learning algorithm (Random Forest). The regression model fitted the data well (pseudo-R<sup>2</sup>â€Š=â€Š84.9%), and we show that standard deviations of green-band reflectances and infra-red region derivatives had the strongest explanatory powers. Our work shows that airborne hyperspectral sensing can be very effective at mapping canopy tree diversity, because its high spatial resolution allows within-plot heterogeneity in reflectance to be characterized, making it an effective tool for monitoring forest biodiversity over large geographic scales.The strips of hyperspectral data which have been collected over the area are shown, together with the location of field plots overlapping the strips.The y-axis represents the percentage increase in OOB- MSE and the x-axis is the band region (in nm).The y-axis represents the percentage in increase in MSE and the x-axis is the band region (in nm).Together, these satellite and airborne based results suggest that spatial resolution is not the main key to successful mapping of biodiversity, and additional studies targeting different ecosystems are needed to clarify the relative importance of spatial and spectral resolution.However, data acquisition in remote and biodiversity rich study areas is still exceptionally challenging. Problems with data and ground truth gathering as those we faced, such as the time lag between field data collection and the airborne survey, or the difficulties in obtaining accurate geo-referencing of field plots, might affected the results and have to be carefully considered when planning hyperspectral-based biodiversity monitoring.Our experience shows that the use of standard devation of reflectance provides satisfactory results, in agreement with the spectral variation hypothesis. We find RF an effective regression tool which is fairly easy to use, and the OOB feature ranking a valuable source of info pertaining to the feature importance.Gola National Park is managed collaboratively by the Royal Society for Protection of Birds, the Conservation Society of Sierra Leone, and the Forestry Division of the Government of Sierra Leone. These organizations provided permits to collect the field data used in this study, and to fly over the area during airborne data acquisition. Field plot data were collected by staff of the Gola Forest Programme, with funding from the UK's Darwin Initiative.

Field study did not involve endangered or protected species.
