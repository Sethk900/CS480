Morphology and ultrastructure of glandular and nonglandular trichomes on the leaves of Athrixia phylicoides (Asteraceae)Athrixia phylicoides is one of many plants from the Asteraceae family used as a traditional herbal medicine. Pharmacological evaluation of leaf extracts confirmed that the plant has anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, narcotic and analgesic properties. The medicinal properties of plants are often linked to the production of essential oil. It is hypothesised that the medicinal value of A. phylicoides can be linked to the production of the aromatic essential oil released by leaves. With the aim at commercial scale propagation, an understanding of the mechanisms involved in the production of medicinally active products will be of great value. Electron- and light microscopic examination of leaves were used to identify and study structures that are apparently involved in the production and secretion of essential oils. Two types of trichomes were identifiedâ€”nonglandular and glandular trichomes. The glandular trichomes are multicellular with a subcuticular storage space and are present only on the adaxial surface of leaves.
