Nomenclatorial changes and redescriptions of three of Navás’ Leucochrysa (Nodita) species (Neuroptera, Chrysopidae)Abstract Three species that Navás described – Leucochrysa (Nodita) azevedoi Navás, 1913, Leucochrysa (Nodita) camposi (Navás, 1933) and Leucochrysa (Nodita) morenoi (Navás, 1934) – have received recent taxonomic attention. All three have many similar external features; indeed Navás himself, as well as subsequent authors, have confused the species with each other. Here, (a) misidentifications are corrected; (b) a neotype of Leucochrysa azevedoi is designated; (c) Leucochrysa (Nodita) morenoi, previously synonymized with Leucochrysa (Nodita) camposi, is recognized as a valid species [Reinstated status] All three species are redescribed and illustrated, with special emphasis on the types. Leucochrysa (Nodita) azevedoi was found to be relatively common in agricultural areas along Brazil’s Atlantic coast. The two other species are known only from their type localities: Leucochrysa (Nodita) camposi – coastal Ecuador, and Leucochrysa (Nodita) morenoi – Quito, Ecuador.
