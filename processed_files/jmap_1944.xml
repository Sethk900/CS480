Estimating the contribution of leaf litter decomposition to soil CO2 efflux in a beech forest using 13C-depleted litter.The contribution of leaf litter decomposition to total soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux (<em>F</em><sub>L</sub>/<em>F</em>) was evaluated in a beech (<em>Fagus sylvatica</em> L.) forest in eastern France. The Keeling-plot approach was applied to estimate the isotopic composition of respired soil CO<sub>2</sub> from soil covered with either control (-;30.32&permil;) or <sup>13</sup>C-depleted leaf litter (-;49.96&permil;). The <em>&delta;</em><sup>13</sup>C of respired soil CO<sub>2</sub> ranged from -;25.50&permil; to -;22.60&permil; and from -;24.95&permil; to -;20.77&permil;, respectively, with depleted or control litter above the soil. The <em>F</em><sub>L</sub>/<em>F</em> ratio was calculated by a single isotope linear mixing model based on mass conservation equations. It showed seasonal variations, increasing from 2.8% in early spring to about 11.4% in mid summer, and decreasing to 4.2% just after leaf fall. Between December 2001 and December 2002, cumulated <em>F</em> and <em>F</em><sub>L</sub> reached 0.98 and 0.08 kg<sub>C</sub> m<sup>-;2</sup>, respectively. On an annual basis, decomposition of fresh leaf litter accounted for 8% of soil respiration and 80% of total C loss from fresh leaf litter. The other fraction of carbon loss during leaf litter decomposition that is assumed to have entered the soil organic matter pool (i.e. 20%) represents only 0.02 kg<sub>C</sub> m<sup>-;2</sup>.
