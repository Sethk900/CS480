The oyster gill proteome (expressed proteins) was sequenced using shotgun proteomics. This effort represents the first time that a global, non-gel based approach has been used to characterize proteins from oyster gill.  The data provide insight into the dynamic functions of this tissue and demonstrate the viability of this approach.  Shotgun proteomics offers an efficient means to characterize proteins in a complex mixture, particularly when sufficient genomic resources are available. In order to assess the practical application of shotgun proteomics in the Pacific oyster ( Crassostrea gigas ), liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry was used to characterize the gill proteome. Using information from the recently published Pacific oyster genome, 1043 proteins were identified. Biological samples ( n â€‰=â€‰4) and corresponding technical replicates (three) were similar in both specific proteins identified and expression, as determined by normalized spectral abundance factor. A majority of the proteins identified (703) were present in all biological samples. Functional analysis of the protein repertoire illustrates that these proteins represent a wide range of biological processes, supporting the dynamic function of the gill. These insights are important for understanding environmental influences on the oyster, because the gill tissue acts as the interface between the oyster and its environment.  In silico  analysis indicated that this sequencing effort identified a large proportion of the complete gill proteome. Together, these data demonstrate that shotgun sequencing is a viable approach for biological discovery and will play an important role in future studies of oyster physiology.  Fluctuations in gene and protein expression can be sensitive and specific indicators of biological processes. At the transcript level, several methodologies can be used to characterize expression from the gene-centric to systems level, including quantitative PCR (e.g.  Griffitt  et al. , 2006 ;  Stumpp  et al. , 2011 ), microarrays (e.g.  Todgham and Hofmann, 2009 ;  Lockwood  et al. , 2010 ), and high-throughput sequencing (e.g.  Polato  et al. , 2011 ;  Philipp  et al. , 2012 ). The use of Â­high-throughput sequencing technology has exponentially increased available genome and transcript information for taxa of ecological interest in recent years. While these results provide an accurate portrayal of changes at the molecular level, it is common that proteins have a more direct role in regulating physiological processes and responding to environmental change.  Historically, there have been several technical and analytical challenges in characterizing global protein expression. One challenge is the need to have sufficient genomic resources available to describe proteins of interest. Specifically, protein sequencing generally produces short amino acid fragments that require a known corresponding gene for identification and annotation purposes. However, lack of genomic resources has not completely hampered proteomic studies. For example, researchers characterized the physiological response of  Gillichthys mirabilis  gill tissue exposed to osmotic and temperature stress using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis without sequencing proteins ( KÃ¼ltz and Somero, 1996 ). In another study, researchers used surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization and identified 11 differentially expressed proteins in the gill tissue of  Oncorhynchus mykiss  exposed to zinc stress ( Hogstrand  et al. , 2002 ). Four proteins were identified based on a combination of their physical properties (i.e. mass and binding) coupled with sequence similarity comparisons with the limited number of teleost protein sequences in the SwissProt database ( Hogstrand  et al. , 2002 ).  The use of predicted protein sequences in closely related species can assist in annotation, but species-specific information will provide more accurate results. This is evident in a study on protein expression in pea ( Pisum sativum ) chloroplasts, where concurrent complementary DNA sequencing facilitated the identification of a greater number of proteins compared with identification through homology searches with closely related model species ( BrÃ¤utigam  et al. , 2008 ). The reason that species-specific information provides such an advantage is due to how modern-day protein sequence identification is executed. The vast majority of high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS) proteomics is accomplished by matching observed peptide fragmentation patterns (tandem mass spectra) to theoretical spectra. This is possible because peptides fragment in a predictable manner, allowing for theoretical tandem mass spectra to be created  in silico  from a given protein sequence, stressing the importance of the database used. These correlation-based algorithms require the peptide mass (precursor mass) and peptide fragmentation (tandem mass spectrum). Even when employing databases of closely related species, a large number of viable tandem mass spectra of peptides might not be assigned accurately to a protein, because a single amino acid mutation could significantly alter the peptide mass and resulting fragmentation pattern.  As technological advances have continued to increase the accessibility of whole transcriptomes and genomes to researchers, there is increasing interest in leveraging these data to carry out proteomic studies for both biological discovery and for better characterizing physiological responses to environmental change. Recently, the Pacific oyster ( Crassostrea gigas ) genome was sequenced ( Zhang  et al. , 2012 ). Given the availability of this resource, our objective was to quantify the level of information (and respective variability) attainable in proteomic studies in oysters. There have been a several prior studies examining protein expression in oysters using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with samples separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) beforehand. In larval oysters, these proteomic techniques have identified specific proteins that are responsible for early developmental changes in  C. gigas  ( Huan  et al. , 2012 ) and the larval  C. gigas  response to elevated partial pressures of CO 2  (ocean acidification;  Dineshram  et al. , 2012 ). These methods have also been used to identify and sequence proteins that are differentially regulated in a range of physiological situations in adult oyster species. The discoveries include the following: the up-regulation of antioxidant proteins in response to ocean acidification ( Tomanek  et al. , 2011 ); expression profiles denoting high-quality oocytes ( Corporeau  et al. , 2012 ); differing proteomic profiles between disease-resistant and disease-susceptible oysters ( Simonian  et al. , 2009 ); and specific responses to metal exposure ( Thompson  et al. , 2011 ,  2012a ,  2012b ;  Liu and Wang, 2012 ) and acid sulfate run-off ( Amaral  et al. , 2012 ). These seminal studies in marine invertebrate proteomics demonstrate that analysis of global protein expression is a powerful tool to facilitate our understanding of the molecular physiological response to environmental stressors.  An alternative to 2-DE approaches is to perform shotgun proteomics. Shotgun proteomics is the sequencing of a complex mixture of peptides using LC-MS/MS without prior separation (i.e. 2-DE). One of the main advantages of using 2-DE methods is that information on the physical properties of the proteins (mass and isoelectric point) can be used in the protein identification, whereas these empirical data are lost in the strictly tandem MS approaches. However, tandem MS has significantly greater data efficiency than gel-based approaches. The use of shotgun proteomics allows for a greater number of proteins to be identified rapidly from a single sample, providing a more complete metabolic picture of cellular function and physiology. This method has been demonstrated by  Muralidharan  et al.  (2012) , who used shotgun proteomics to uncover  Saccostrea glomerata  haemocyte proteomic responses to metal contamination, and by  Dheilly  et al.  (2012 ,  2013 ), who explored the proteomic response of coelomocytes to immune challenge in two urchin species.  In this study, we used shotgun proteomics to sequence the gill proteome of the Pacific oyster,  Crassostrea gigas . The gill is the interface between bivalves and their environment, necessitating that the tissue performs a variety of physiological functions in response to the environment (e.g.  David  et al. , 2007 ;  Wang  et al. , 2010 ). The identification of proteins that are expressed in gill tissue supports the development of tools that can help to guide future research on the molecular physiology of molluscs faced with stresses such as climate change and disease. The goal of this study was to determine the effectiveness of using a shotgun proteomics approach and to carry out functional characterization of proteins expressed in gill tissue.  Pacific oysters ( C. gigas , 18â€…months old) were collected in Shelton, WA, USA. Oysters were transferred to Friday Harbor Laboratories (Friday Harbor, WA, USA) into a flow-through system at 13Â°C for 6â€…weeks. Eight 4â€…l vessels containing six oysters each were kept in a water bath with seawater flowing through at 57.5â€…ml/min. Vessels were cleaned every other day with fresh-water and salt-water rinses. Oysters were fed Shellfish Diet 1800 (Reed Mariculture, Campbell, CA, USA). At the end of sixâ€…weeks, gill tissue was removed from four oysters and immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for proteomic analysis.  Gill tissue samples (50â€“100â€…mg) were homogenized in 50â€…mM NH 4 HCO 3  (100â€…Âµl) using RNAse-free plastic pestles. Each homogenized gill sample was sonicated four times with a probe sonicator and stored on dry ice between sonications. After sonication, protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford assay, following the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Urea (36â€…mg) was added to each sample (for a total concentration of 6â€…M) to denature and solubilize peptides. Next, 1.5â€…M Tris (pH 8.8; 6.6â€…Âµl) was added, followed by 200â€…mM ( tris (2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) (2.5â€…Âµl). Samples were incubated for 1â€…h at 37Â°C on a shaker. To alkylate the proteins, 200â€…mM iodoacetamide (20â€…Âµl) was added. Samples were then vortexed, and incubated for 1â€…h at room temperature in the dark. To absorb excess iodoacetamide, 200â€…mM dithiolthreitol (20â€…Âµl) was added, followed by vortexing and incubation at room temperature for 1â€…h. A volume equal to approximately 100â€…Âµg was removed, and the remainder was discarded. Ammonium bicarbonate (200â€…Âµl of 25â€…mM) was added to dilute the urea, and then high-pressure liquid chromagography (HPLC) grade MeOH (50â€…Âµl) was added to each tube. Trypsin was solubilized in a trypsin dilution buffer (20â€…Âµl) to a concentration of 1â€…Âµg/Î¼l (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), and 3â€…Âµl of this solution was added to each sample to digest the proteins enzymatically. The samples were incubated overnight at 37Â°C. The next day, dilute formic acid was added, and the samples were evaporated on the speed vac to near dryness. Samples were reconstituted in 200â€…Âµl of 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid.  Samples were desalted by passage through a pre-prepared MacroSpin column, following the manufacturer's specifications (The Nest Group, Southborough, MA, USA). After desalting, the remaining solvent was evaporated using a speed vac.  Mass spectrometry was performed at the University of Washington Proteomics Resource (Seattle, WA, USA). Samples were resuspended in 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water (100â€…Âµl). Samples were then vortexed to mix and spun down at 21130â€‰Ã—â€‰g for 10â€…min. The supernatant was aliquoted to autosampler vials. Nano LC separation was performed with a nanoACUITY system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) interfaced to an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA). Peptides were trapped on a 100â€…Âµm i.d.â€‰Ã—â€‰20â€…mm long pre-column packed with 200â€…Ã… (5â€…Âµm) Magic C18 particles (C18AQ; Michrom, Auburn, CA, USA). For separation, a 75â€…Âµm i.d.â€‰Ã—â€‰250â€…mm long analytical column with a laser pulled emitter tip packed with 100â€…Ã… (5â€…Âµm) Magic C18 particles (C18Q; Michrom) was used and analysed in positive ion mode. For each LC-MS/MS analysis, an estimated amount of 0.5â€…Âµg of peptides was loaded onto the pre-column at 2â€…Âµl/min in water/acetonitrile (98%/2%), with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. Peptides were eluted using an acetonitrile gradient flowing at 240â€…nl/min, using a mobile phase consisting of the following components: Solventâ€…C (water, 0.1% formic acid) and Solventâ€…D (acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). The gradient programme was as follows: 0â€“1â€…min, Solventâ€…C (98%) and Solventâ€…D (2%); 1â€…min, Solventâ€…C (90%) and Solventâ€…D (10%); 90â€…min, Solventâ€…C (65%) and Solventâ€…D (35%); 91â€“101â€…min, Solventâ€…C (20%) and Solventâ€…D (80%); and 102â€“120â€…min, Solventâ€…C (98%) and Solventâ€…D (2%). Peptide spectra were acquired by scans in the Orbitrap followed by the ion trap.  High-resolution full precursor ion scans were acquired at 60â€…000 resolution in the Orbitrap over 400â€“2000â€… m / z  while six consecutive tandem mass spectra were acquired by collision-induced dissociation in the linear ion trap (LTQ). The data-dependent ion threshold was set at 5000 counts for MS/MS, and the maximum allowed ion accumulation times were 400â€…ms for full scans and 100â€…ms for MS/MS measurements. The number of ions accumulated was set to 1E6 for Orbitrap scans and 1E4 for linear ion trap MS/MS scans. An angiotensin and neurotensin standard was run after every eight injections. Each sample was injected in triplicate in a novel randomized order.  Peptide sequence and corresponding protein identification for all mass spectra was carried out using SEQUEST ( Eng  et al. , 1994 ) and the  C. gigas  proteome version 9 ( Zhang  et al. , 2012 ,  http://dx.doi.org/10.5524/100030 ). A DECOY database was created by reversing the  C. gigas  proteome and adding it to the forward database. This was completed in order to determine false positive matches of peptide spectra matching, and yielded a false discovery rate of âˆ¼0.6%. Search parameters included trypsin as the assigned enzyme and a precursor mass accuracy of +3â€…Da. SEQUEST results were analysed using PeptideProphet and ProteinProphet in order to evaluate peptide matches statistically and assign protein probabilities ( Nesvizhskii  et al. , 2003 ). Only proteins with a probability of â‰¥0.9 (estimated false discovery rate of 0.6%), a minimum of two unique peptide hits within a single replicate, and a minimum of four total tandem mass spectral assignments in the combined technical and biological replicates were used in further characterizations described below.  In order to annotate corresponding proteins, the  C. gigas  proteome (version 9) was compared with the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database ( www.uniprot.org ) using Blastp with an e-value limit of 1â€‰Ã—â€‰10 âˆ’10 . Associated gene ontology (GO) terms were used to classify sequences based on biological process, as well as to categorize genes into parent categories (GO Slim). Enrichment analysis was used to identify over-represented biological processes in the gill proteome compared with the entire proteome [Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), version 6.7;  Huang  et al. , 2009a ,  2009b ,  http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/ ]. The results of the enrichment analysis were visualized in REViGO (Reduce and Visualize Gene Ontology;  Supek  et al. , 2011 ,  http://revigo.irb.hr/ ). Normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF;  Florens  et al. , 2006 ) was used to calculate expression for each protein in each oyster. Technical replicates were pooled by taking the sum of total independent tandem mass spectra for each protein (SpC). For each protein, SpC was divided by protein length ( L ). The NSAF is calculated from SpC/ L  divided by the sum of all SpC/ L  values for the proteins for a particular oyster. Comparisons of proteins identified across biological samples were visualized using Venny ( Oliveros, 2007 ).  The minimum number of peptides needed to be sequenced to optimize unique protein identifications was determined using an  in silico  approach. A list was constructed of all sequenced peptides and their matching protein identification. Redundancies were maintained in this list, so that if a certain peptide was sequenced multiple times it was included multiple times in the list. Randomized subsets of this list were generated using the sample function in R ( R Development Core Team, 2009 ). The number of hypothetically sequenced peptides in these lists ranged from 500 to 70â€…000. A plot was generated to visualize the relationship between each sample size of randomly chosen peptides and the number of unique proteins identified.  Summary of the number of peptides sequenced and proteins identified for each oyster (labelled Aâ€“D)  Total independent spectral counts for three technical replicates for oysterâ€…A plotted for each protein ( n â€‰=â€‰1500). Similar patterns were observed for the other three oysters (data not shown).  Venn diagram of proteins identified among biological samples. Proteins identified in oysterâ€…A are in the blue ellipse, B in yellow, C in green, and oyster D proteins are in the red ellipse.  The 12 most abundant proteins in the gill proteome as determined by identifying the 10 most abundant proteins in each oyster  Protein ID for the oyster is given, as well as protein description from UniProt-KB/SwissProt, SwissProt Accession Number for the homologous protein used to annotate the oyster protein, and the oysters in which the protein was detected.  Representation of biological processes corresponding to the proteins identified from oyster gill tissue.  Enrichment analysis was carried out to determine which biological processes were over-represented in gill tissue in comparison to the entire proteome. Several of the functional groups identified were associated with the abundant proteins involved in metabolism and transport, as well as structural processes (i.e. actin-filament and microtubule) and oxidationâ€“reduction. The most significantly enriched biological process was generation of precursor metabolites and energy. Protein IDs (accession numbers starting with â€œCGIâ€) corresponding to the proteins that contributed to GO term enrichment are listed in  Supplementary Data 5 .  Predicted number of unique proteins that would be identified based on a sequential increase in peptide sequences.  Technical and analytical challenges have resulted in limited focus on quantitative proteomics approaches in environmental physiology. Given the recent technological advances in the proteomics field ( Yates  et al. , 2009 ) and release of the Pacific oyster genome ( Zhang  et al. , 2012 ), we set out to assess the practical use of quantitative proteomics in this model species. For all biological samples, a majority of the proteins identified (54â€“55%) were present in all respective technical replicates. Relative expression across technical and biological replicates was also consistent (Fig.  1 ,  Supplementary Data 1 ). However, there were some proteins not identified in all technical replicates. Thus, proteins with limited expression might not be detected and/or expression levels might not be reflected accurately. It should be noted that the inclusion of proteins in our analysis is highly dependent on threshold selection. In the present study, a protein was included only if it had two unique spectral hits within a replicate and had four total spectra across the combined technical replicate data. If the threshold were adjusted to be more conservative (i.e. a greater total spectral count threshold), variability would be reduced. With a total spectral count threshold of five, 983 proteins are identified and 56â€“57% of the proteins are in all three technical replicates; with a threshold of 10, 845 proteins are identified and 61â€“63% of the proteins are in all technical replicates (data not shown).  The number of proteins identified and subsequently annotated can vary tremendously based on experimental design, target tissue, match thresholds, and genomic resources available. In the present study, the majority of the proteins (703) were identified in all biological samples. Based on  in silico  analysis (Fig.  4 ), we have sequenced a relatively complete proteome for oyster gill tissue. In a study of European whitefish,  Coregonus lavaretus , proteomics on fish larvae yielded sequencing of peptides corresponding to 1500 proteins ( Papakostas  et al. , 2012 ). The similar number of protein identifications in whitefish compared with our study (1043) is likely to be associated with the tissue complexity. In the whitefish study, whole body tissue was examined. In a metaproteomics study of marine microbes, 2273 distinct proteins were identified across 10 samples ( Morris  et al. , 2010 ). The large number of proteins identified by  Morris  et al.  (2010)  is evidence of the large number of organisms and ecological niches that were sampled in their study. Previous proteomics studies on Sydney rock oyster haemolymph have found relatively few proteins compared with the present study in gill tissue, with the number of identified proteins ranging from 49 to 514 ( Simonian  et al. , 2009 ;  Thompson  et al. , 2011 ,  2012a ,  2012b ;  Muralidharan  et al. , 2012 ). The identification of fewer proteins in haemolymph is probably because there are fewer cell types present in haemolymph compared with the gill.  In addition to assessing the feasibility of shotgun proteomics in the Pacific oyster, we were also able to provide a functional characterization of the gill proteome. Gene ontology characterization identified a majority of proteins associated with protein metabolism, cell organization and biogenesis, and transport (Fig.  3 ). These biological functions would be expected, because gill tissue is the primary interface between the oyster and the environment (water), where the tissue's major functions include ion regulation, respiration, and sorting of food particles. The high number of proteins involved in these GO categories is not necessarily unique to gill tissue but is likely to reflect the multifunctional nature of a tissue that responds to variable environments.  Enrichment analysis was performed to identify which functional groups of proteins expressed in gill tissue were over-represented incomparison to the complete protein repertoire. Several of the functional groups identified were associated with the abundant proteins involved in metabolism and transport, as well as cellular structure. These enrichment analysis findings are consistent with a previous transcriptomic comparison between  C. gigas  gill tissue and other tissues, with genes predominantly expressed in the gill being involved in epithelia morphogenesis, cilia movement, and detoxification and defense ( Dheilly  et al. , 2011 ). Some of the cytoskeletal proteins identified in gill were tektin-3, microtubule-associated protein futsch, and actin. Tektin is part of cilia and flagellar microtubules and has been found to change expression in response to an elevated partial pressure of CO 2  ( Dineshram  et al. , 2013 ), and has also been identified in Sydney rock oyster haemolymph ( Thompson  et al. , 2012b ). Transport proteins included ATP synthases and v-type proton ATP synthase. ATP synthase is a good marker of environmental stress in  C. gigas , because its transcript expression is altered in response to hypoxia ( David  et al. , 2005 ) and pesticide exposure ( Tanguy  et al. , 2005 ). The most significantly enriched biological process was generation of precursor metabolites and energy. Many of the proteins that contributed to the over-representation of this GO category in the gill tissue are involved in metabolic processes, such as 2-Â­oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, dihydroplipoyllisin-residue acetyltransferase, glycogen phosphorylase, triose phosphate isomerase, and hexokinase. These enzymes are all involved in the breakdown of carbohydrates and other food inputs, and thus underline the important metabolic processes that occur in the gill.  Proteins involved in oxygen metabolism and reactive oxygen species defense were also enriched in gill tissue, providing further support for the importance of gill tissue in response to environmental change. Previous transcriptomics-based studies of oysters support that the oxidative stress response plays an important role in the gill tissue (e.g.  David  et al. , 2007 ;  Fleury and Huvet, 2012 ). Genes and proteins responding to production of reactive oxygen species increase in oysters in many instances of environmental stress, such as exposure to contaminants (e.g.  David  et al. , 2007 ;  Muralidharan et al., 2012 ), as well as exposure to ocean acidification ( Tomanek  et al. , 2011 ) and temperature stress ( Meistertzheim  et al. , 2007 ). Specific proteins that contribute to reactive oxygen species defense are enzymes instrumental in the physiological response to oxidative stress, such as the antioxidants superoxide dismutase, peroxiredoxin, and catalase.  The success of the shotgun sequencing effort was due in part to the recent publication of the  C. gigas  genome, Â­emphasizing that the dissemination of genomic resources Â­provides invaluable opportunities for advancement for the scientific community. The sharing of these large data sets, such as the genome and the gill proteome, will support further research into the effects of environmental changes on the oyster in terms of both acclimatization and adaptation. The characterization of the scope of acclimatization and adaptation are instrumental in understanding how the Pacific oyster, an ecologically and economically important species, can respond to climate change at the physiological and population levels. These research results demonstrate that shotgun sequencing of oyster gill tissue is a viable approach for biological discovery and that it will be likely to play an important role in future studies on oyster physiology.
