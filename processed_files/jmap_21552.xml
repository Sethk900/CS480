A new genus Squamophis of Asteroschematidae (Echinodermata, Ophiuroidea, Euryalida) from AustraliaAbstract Squamophis, a new genus of brittle star is described. Two species are included in the genus: Squamophis amamiensis (Okanishi & Fujita, 2009) from south-western Japan and Squamophis albozosteres sp. n. from north-western Australia. Squamophis gen. n. is distinguished from the other genera of the family Asteroschematidae by the following characters: each radial shield is single-layered and is completely covered by plate-shaped epidermal ossicles, and the relative length of the longest arm spine throughout the arms is as long as the length of the corresponding arm segment. Squamophis albozosteres sp. n. is distinguished from Squamophis amamiensis in having white, slightly domed, plate-shaped epidermal ossicles on the aboral side of the body, the ossicles on aboral and lateral portion of the arms form transverse rows, and the other part of aboral side of disc and basal to middle portion of arms are brown but tip of the arms are light purple.
