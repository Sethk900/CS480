The status and conservation of the Asiatic black bear in Nikshahr County, Baluchistan District of IranLittle information exists on the Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus gerdrosianus) in the western part of its distribution. This study investigated the status of this species in the Baluchistan district of Iran, from April 2004 to February 2006. Sign surveys and interviews with elderly localâ€born people revealed that although this bear was commonly seen by locals in many areas 20â€“30 years ago, at present, it only exists in four localities in Nikshahr County (Aband, Kushad, Shoshin and the Pozak Protected Area). Each of these four areas appears to be occupied by only a few individual bears. It seems that the largest number of black bear live in the Aband Mountains, followed by the Kushad Mountains, Shoshin and the Pozak Protected Area. Habitat fragmentation as the result of human habitation, livestock grazing and a continuous severe drought has caused insularization of these small bear populations in Nikshahr. The Asiatic black bear in Nikshahr is endangered in the entire area and is in need of urgent conservation action. The education and coâ€operation of local people, and active management to restore habitat, are vital if this species is to persist in this region.
