The mayfly genus Acerpenna (Insecta, Ephemeroptera, Baetidae) in Latin AmericaThe genus Acerpenna (Ephemeroptera: Baetidae), previously known from North America north of Mexico, is shown to occur extensively in Latin America, where it demonstrates considerable variability. The genus includes species with or without hindwings, with or without gills on abdominal segment 1, and with gills on abdominal segment 7 either rounded or pointed apically. Americabaetis, originally considered a subgenus of Baetis s. 1. and having one nominal species described from Cuba, is synonymized with Acerpenna. Besides A. naranjoi (Kluge), n. comb., four new species of Acerpenna are described from Latin America: A. boriquensis, n. sp., from the Greater Antilles, A. intermedia, n. sp., from Central America, A. pletura, n. sp., from Central America and Mexico, and A. robacki, n.sp., from South America.
