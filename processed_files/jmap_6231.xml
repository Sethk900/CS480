The use of acid Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to determine the effect of locality of growth on the protein profiles of barley, wheat and honeybush teaAcid Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (A-PAGE) of proteins was used to identify different spring wheat cultivare, barley cultivars and Cyclopia species. Experimental conditions for the extraction of the proteins from single kernels as well as corresponding flour samples are described. Different solvents for extracting the proteins are mentioned. An electrophoretic formula was prepared for each cultivar and species using relative band mobility and staining intensities of protein bands. Distinctive band patterns were obtained. Cultivars and species collected on different locations were subsequently analysed.
