Occurrence of Greater Sage-Grouse x Sharp-tailed Grouse hybrids in AlbertaTwo distinct grouse were regularly observed at two Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) 1eks in both 1999 and 2000 in southeastern Alberta. Physically and behaviorally, the birds exhibited characteristics of both Greater Sage-Grouse and Sharp-tailed Grouse (Tympanuchas phasianellus), suggesting they were hybrids. DNA analyses of blood and feather samples indicated that both birds were males with Greater Sage-Grouse mothers and thus, fathers that were likely Sharp-tailed Grouse.
