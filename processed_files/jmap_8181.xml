Measurement of pollen clump release and breakup in the vicinity of ragweed (              A. confertiflora              ) staminate flowers            Pollen dispersal is fundamental in a plant's reproductive ecology and as a result of fragmentation of the landscape, questions have been raised on how isolated plant populations can still exchange genetic information. A common mechanism for gene exchange is wind pollination (anemophily). A successful anemophilous species native to North America is ragweed (Ambrosia), a weed that is hard to eradicate after it takes root on crop fields and its pollen causes very strong allergenic effects (hay fever). Despite the extremely clumpy nature of ragweed pollen that should limit its long distance dispersal, ragweed has spread rapidly across the world during the last century while maintaining a high genetic diversity. One of the reasons for its success may be prolific pollen production as well as an efficient pollen clump release and breakup mechanism. Efficient pollen entrainment and dispersal into the atmosphere is highly influenced by flow field characteristics as pollen released into the atmosphere initially encounters flow structures created by the plant's morphology. Here, the flow field in the wake of a mature ragweed spike having multiple staminate flowers as well as pollen release was studied using Particle Image Velocimetry and high-speed, inline holographic cinematography. The latter enabled to track the pollen in a 3D volume. The spike was set up in a wind tunnel and exposed to wind speeds ranging from 1 to 2 m/s. Results indicated that ragweed pollen was released in multiple sized clumps containing tens to several thousand single grains. Clumps were both â€œpulled apartâ€ at the point of entrainment while exiting the flowers as well as broke up in smaller sized clumps in high shear rate flow regions not far from the spike. In addition, the largest clumps that did not travel far, deposited in the vicinity of the spike, breaking apart into many small clumps upon deposition. Based on our results, initial release and dispersal of ragweed pollen clumps is characterized by three concomitant mechanisms of clump breakup occurring at entrainment, in mid-air and on deposition, which make it perfectly suited to disperse pollen over a wide range of spatial scales.
