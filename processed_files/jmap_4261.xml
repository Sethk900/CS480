Spectrum of Ants Associated with Araucaria angustifolia Trees and Their Relations to Hemipteran TrophobiontsThe community of ants inhabiting Araucaria angustifolia trees or foraging on this conifer was studied in the rain forest reserve Pr√≥-Mata on the Serra Geral of Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. Ants of 44 species were recorded of which 23 were nesting on Araucaria trees. Data on their abundance and relationships to trophobionts are presented. Amongst the latter, Planococcus citri was by far the most common species. It was associated with ants of the genera Crematogaster, Solenopsis (Diplorhoptrum), Linepithema, Myrmelachista and Camponotus. The results are discussed under ecological and biogeographical aspects.
