Capitulum density-dependent effects generate peak seed yield at an intermediate density of a Tibetan lotusAims Theory suggests that species perform best at intermediate densities, where density-dependent facilitation and antagonism are balanced, but empirical evidence is scarce, particularly in plants. In a self-incompatible perennial herb (Saussurea nigrescens), whose recruitment heavily relies on seed output, we test whether both intraspecific facilitation and antagonism significantly affect seed production, resulting in highest seed yield at an intermediate capitulum density.
