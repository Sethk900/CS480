AoB PLANTS   5 : plt045; doi:10.1093/aobpla/plt045   Correlation between C concentration (µg C per g soil) and available nitrogen (µg NO 3 -N per 0.01 g soil, solid spheres) or soil respiration (µg CO 2  per g soil per h, hollow spheres), in soil from open areas treated with four levels of C, control (0 µg C per g soil), low (125 µg C per g soil), medium (250 µg C per g soil) and high (500 µg C per g soil) on the 60th day of first amendment. Double asterisks indicate that correlation coefficient  r  is significant at  P  &lt; 0.01. Inset, mean (+SE) biomass of 60-day-old  A. adenophora  seedlings in soil from open areas treated with the above-mentioned three levels of C on the 60th day of first amendment. Asterisks above the bars represent a significant difference between the dry biomass of seedlings grown in soils amended with glucose and the unamended soil taken as the control (Independent Samples  t -Test;  P  &lt; 0.05, Table 2).
