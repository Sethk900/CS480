Historical Stem-Mapped Permanent Plots Increase Precision of Reconstructed Reference Data in Ponderosa Pine Forests of Northern ArizonaForest structural reference conditions are widely used to understand how ecosystems have been altered and guide restoration and management objectives. We used six stem-mapped permanent plots established in the early twentieth century to provide precise structural reference conditions for ponderosa pine forests of northern Arizona prior to Euro-American settlement. Reference conditions for these plots in 1873–1874 included the following historical attributes: tree densities of 45–127 trees/ha, mean tree diameter at breast height (dbh) of 43.8 cm with a corresponding quadratic mean diameter range of 41.5–51.3 cm, and a stand basal area of 9.2–18.0 m2/ha. The reconstructed diameter distributions (for live ponderosa pine trees with dbh ≥9.14 cm) prior to fire exclusion varied in shape but generally displayed an irregular unimodal distribution. We suggest that management objectives for the structural restoration of ponderosa pine forests of northern Arizona emphasize: (1) conservation and retention of all pre-settlement (>130 years) trees; (2) reduction of tree densities with a restoration objective ranging between 50 and 150 trees/ha having a large-tree component between 25 and 50% of the total trees per hectare, respectively; (3) manipulation of the diameter distribution to achieve a unimodal or irregular, uneven-aged shape (possibly targeting a balanced, uneven-aged shape on cinder soil types) through the use of harvest and thinning practices that mimic gap disturbances (i.e., individual tree selection system); and (4) retention of 3–11 snags and logs per hectare resulting from natural mortality.
