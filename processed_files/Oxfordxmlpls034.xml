One (<italic>EBF1</italic>) was found to reduce the activity of three apple <italic>EIN3-like</italic> genesFruit ripening in <italic>Malus</italic>× <italic>domestica</italic> (apple) is controlled by ethylene. Work in model species has shown that following the detection of ethylene, the ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3 (EIN3) transcription factor is stabilized, leading to an increase in transcript accumulation of ethylene-responsive genes, such as <italic>POLYGALACTURONASE1</italic> (<italic>PG1</italic>). In the absence of ethylene, the EIN3 BINDING F-box (EBF) proteins rapidly degrade EIN3 via the ubiquitination/SCF (Skp, Cullin, F-Box) proteasome pathway. In this study, we aim to identify and characterize the apple <italic>EBF</italic> genes, and test their activity against apple EIN3-like proteins (EILs).The apple genome sequence was mined for <italic>EBF</italic>-like genes. The expression of <italic>EBF</italic>-like genes was measured during fruit development. Using a transient assay in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> leaves, the activity of three apple EILs was tested against the <italic>PG1</italic> promoter, with and without ethylene and EBF1.Four <italic>EBF</italic>-like genes in apple were identified and grouped into two sub-clades. Sub-clade I genes had constant expression over fruit development while sub-clade II genes increased in expression at ripening. EBF1 was shown to reduce the transactivation of the apple <italic>PG1</italic> promoter by the EIL1, EIL2 and EIL3 transcription factors in the presence of ethylene.The apple <italic>EBF1</italic> gene identified here is likely to be a functionally conserved <italic>EBF</italic> orthologue, modulating EIL activity in apples. The activity of EBF1 suggests that it is not specific to a single EIL, instead acting as a global regulator of apple EIL transcription factors.Ethylene is involved in a wide range of developmental processes in plants including seed germination, cell elongation, sex determination, fruit ripening, senescence and leaf abscission, as well as biotic and abiotic stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C1">Abeles and Biles 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C2">Barry and Giovannoni 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C22">Lin <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). The ethylene response pathway can be briefly summarized as follows: the pathway is thought to be predominantly linear, consisting of ethylene receptors, which in the absence of ethylene constitutively repress the activity of the MAP kinase CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1 (CTR1); this modulates the activity of ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 2 (EIN2), which results in the destabilization of the ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3 (EIN3) transcription factors. In the presence of ethylene this pathway is repressed and EIN3 is stabilized, initiating a transcriptional cascade leading to an ethylene response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C5">Chen <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>).In the absence of ethylene, EIN3 is short-lived with a half-life of &lt;30 min due to rapid degradation through the ubiquitin/Skp, Cullin, F-Box degradation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C11">Guo and Ecker 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C34">Yanagisawa <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, two redundant nuclear localized F-box proteins, EIN3-BINDING F BOX PROTEIN1 (AtEBF1) and AtEBF2, were shown to target EIN3 and a functional homologue EIN3-like 1 (EIL1) for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C11">Guo and Ecker 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C24">Potuschak <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C3">Binder <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). Loss-of-function <italic>ebf1 ebf2</italic> double mutants had high levels of EIN3 protein and consequently exhibited a constitutive ethylene response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C4">Chao <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C24">Potuschak <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>). While EBF1 and EBF2 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> are constitutively expressed over plant development, they both show an increase in expression with exogenously added ethylene, and over-expression of <italic>EBF1</italic> resulted in reduced EIN3 levels leading to an ethylene-insensitive phenotype. These results suggest that the <italic>EBF</italic>-like genes are controlled, at least in part, at the transcription level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C24">Potuschak <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>).In tomato, two <italic>EBF</italic>-like genes have also been identified: <italic>EBF1</italic> and <italic>EBF2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C35">Yang <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). Consistent with the results in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, silencing of either gene resulted in plants that were indistinguishable from controls, indicating that they are functionally redundant. The results suggested a feedback mechanism whereby suppression of one <italic>EBF</italic> gene resulted in an increase in transcription of the second. As in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, a constitutive ethylene response phenotype was observed when both <italic>EBF1</italic> and <italic>EBF2</italic> were silenced in tomato, including accelerated fruit ripening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C35">Yang <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). However, unlike <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the expression of tomato <italic>EBF1</italic> and <italic>EBF2</italic> was not constitutive, with a transient decrease in expression at the onset of ripening (mature green), and consistent with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> both showed an increase of expression with ethylene and a decrease with auxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C35">Yang <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). Tomato <italic>EBF1</italic> appeared to be less affected at the transcriptional level, while <italic>EBF2</italic> appeared to be more transcriptionally variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C35">Yang <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>).In the fleshy fruiting apple, ethylene plays a key role in the control of fruit ripening. The importance of ethylene in apple fruit ripening was confirmed with the suppression of the ripening-associated ethylene biosynthesis gene <italic>ACC OXIDASE 1</italic> (<italic>ACO1</italic>). In these apples, no ripening-associated flesh softening or aroma volatiles are produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C25">Schaffer <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C18">Johnston <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Owing to consumer requirements to maintain a firm texture, many commercial apples have been selected for low ripening-related ethylene. This has been achieved in part through the selection of lines with disrupted ethylene biosynthetic gene <italic>ACC SYNTHASE</italic> (<italic>ACS</italic>), leading to longer storage capacity and slower softening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C12">Harada <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C6">Costa <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C33">Wiersma <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C32">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Owing to the importance of ethylene in fruit ripening, much of the molecular biology research conducted in apple has been focused on ethylene biosynthesis and response. One of the earliest genes cloned from apple was the <italic>ETHYLENE RESPONSE 1</italic> (<italic>ETR1</italic>)-like receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C21">Lee <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>), along with the ethylene biosynthetic gene <italic>ACO1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C20">Lay-Yee and Knighton 1995</xref>). Subsequent work identified four other receptor-like genes, a <italic>CTR1</italic>-like gene, an <italic>EIN2-</italic>like gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C33">Wiersma <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>) and three <italic>EIN3</italic>-like genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C29">Tacken <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). With the release of the complete apple genome sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C30">Velasco <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>), there is now a growing literature studying whole gene families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C7">Devoghalaere <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>), which has led to the identification of three further receptor genes in apple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C16">Ireland <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>).While five <italic>EIN3</italic>-like genes have been identified in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, ethylene signal transduction occurs predominantly through the action of two of them, EIN3 and EIL1. Originally identified through an ethylene-insensitive phenotype, it was proposed that EIN3 acted by binding and activating the promoters of the AP2/ERF class of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C28">Solano <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>). Since this study, it has been shown that EIN3-like transcription factors are likely to be involved directly in the activation of a suite of ethylene biosynthesis and response genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C15">Huang <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C29">Tacken <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C36">Yin <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>), and transient assays suggest that EIL2 and EIL3 in apple may be involved in the up-regulation of key apple ripening genes such as the cell wall hydrolase <italic>endo-POLYGALACTURONASE 1</italic> (<italic>PG1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C29">Tacken <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>).Owing to the importance of the <italic>EBF</italic> class of genes as key controllers of the ethylene signal transduction pathway, this study used the apple genome sequence to identify <italic>EBF</italic>-like genes. One <italic>EBF</italic>-like gene (<italic>EBF1</italic>) was cloned and tested for the ability to inhibit the activity of three EILs in a <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> transient assay.Apple EBF-like genes.Gene expression levels from a fruit development cDNA series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C17">Janssen <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>) were determined via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using the Lightcycler480™ (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).

While these genomes allow researchers to look at features that are unique to different and often commercially important plant species, it is important to translate knowledge gained from model systems to these species of interest. In this study, we build on the growing literature of ethylene-related genes in apple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C21">Lee <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C33">Wiersma <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C29">Tacken <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C16">Ireland <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>) by the characterization of the <italic>EBF</italic>-like genes. Interestingly, in apple there are four <italic>EBF</italic>-like genes, consistent with the genome duplication, while the closely related Rosaceae species strawberry has two. In the model species tomato and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the <italic>EBF</italic> family is encoded redundantly by at least two genes. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> the two <italic>EBF</italic> genes fall into sub-clade I, while tomato has one gene in each sub-clade (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS034F2">2</xref>).In <italic>Arabidopsis, EBF1</italic> and <italic>EBF2</italic> mRNA is constitutively expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C11">Guo and Ecker 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C24">Potuschak <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>) and has been shown to be targeted for degradation by EIN5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C23">Olmedo <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>), suggesting that mRNA levels are actively regulated. In tomato, <italic>EBF1</italic> is constitutively expressed with <italic>EBF2</italic> showing considerable changes in expression over development and in different treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS034C35">Yang <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). From this observation it was suggested that as <italic>EBF1</italic> had a more consistent level of expression, it was providing the steady-state level of EBF, and fluctuations of <italic>EBF2</italic> allowed the plant to respond to the environment. In apples, the two classes of <italic>EBF</italic>-like genes appear to follow the same pattern with sub-clade I genes (<italic>EBF1</italic> and <italic>EBF101</italic>) showing little variation in expression, while the sub-clade II genes (<italic>EBF2</italic> and <italic>EBF102</italic>) both increase as the fruit begin to ripen. Although the sub-clade I tomato gene <italic>EBF1</italic> had a more consistent level of expression, it did have lower expression in mature green fruit. This was not observed in the expression pattern of <italic>EBF1</italic> in apples, though as this drop was transitory in tomato, there is a possibility that a similar drop in apple would be missed in a less detailed time series experiment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS034F3">3</xref>).In this study, three apple EIN3-like genes were tested in a transient assay for activity against the <italic>PG1</italic> promoter. All three apple EILs had reduced activity against the <italic>PG1</italic> promoter, in the presence of EBF1, showing that the apple EBF1 was not specific to a single EIL. The non-specific nature of the EBFs is consistent with the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> EBF1 and EBF2, where both interact with EIN3 and EIL1, again suggesting a lack of specificity in these F-box proteins to individual EIL proteins.An F-box gene <italic>EBF1</italic> was identified in apple, the predicted protein product of which clustered with EBF-like protein<italic>s</italic> involved in the ethylene response in other plant species. <italic>EBF1</italic> negatively regulated activation of <italic>PG1</italic> by the apple <italic>EILs</italic>, consistent with the degradation of EIN3 by EBF1 and EBF2 observed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tomato. These results also suggest that apple EBF1 acts as a functional EBF upon multiple members of the EIL family of transcription factors. This work suggests that the <italic>EBF</italic>-like genes in apple are likely to play a crucial role in the control of ethylene-related fruit ripening.<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/pls034/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">The following additional information is available in the online version of this article</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/pls034/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">–Text files of apple <italic>EBF</italic> DNA sequences and predicted proteins.</ext-link>Apple EBF1 GenBank accession no.
