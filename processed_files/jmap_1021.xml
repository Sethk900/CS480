Replacement value of Solanum elaeagnifolium for alfalfa hay offered to growing goats.In order to determine the nutritional properties of Solanum elaeagnifolium in goat diets, chemical analysis, in vitro techniques and a feeding trial were conducted. S. elaeagnifolium replaced alfalfa hay in the diet of confined growing goats at 0% (T0), 25% (T25), 50% (T50), 75% (T75), and 100% (T100). Roughage comprised 300 g kg-;1 of total feed offered. Values of nutritional parameters for S. elaeagnifolium were in vitro OMD, 522 g kg-;1; crude protein (CP), 150 g kg-;1; metabolizable energy, 6.52 MJ kg-;1 DM. Maximum average daily gain (ADG; 116+/-22 g day-;1) was observed in T0 animals, while goats receiving S. elaeagnifolium gained weight in the range of 40-112 g day-;1. Most of the variation in weight gain was explained by ascending levels of S. elaeagnifolium in the diet (R2=0.92), which decreased (P<0.05) dry matter intake (DMI) and increased feed conversion ratio (FCR; DMI/ADG). These results indicate that S. elaeagnifolium at the flowering stage is not palatable and nutritious for goats. This forb can replace alfalfa hay only by 25% (DM basis) without adverse effect on DMI or ADG of growing goats.
