Earthworms from the Kivu Region, D.R. Congo with description of two new Dichogaster Beddard, 1888 (Oligochaeta: Acanthodrilidae, Ocnerodrilidae)During a visit to the Natural History Museum, London a rich unidentified earthworm material was found, collected in the early 1970s by Gasana N'Doli in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Elaborating this material resulted in recording seven Dichogaster species (Acanthodrilidae: Benhamiinae) of which two, Dichogaster (Diplothecodrilus) gasanai and D. (Dt.) paulclarki, are new to science. On the basis of the newly identified material a more complete description of D. (Dt.) foetida is given and D. (Dt). rubella is placed in its synonymy. Apart from the dichogastrids two little known Pygmaeodrilus species (Ocnerodrilidae), P. kiwuensis and P. modesutus, are also recorded.
