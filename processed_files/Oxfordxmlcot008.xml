salmon, which may be partially attributed to physiological limitations in aerobic performance. This study suggests that the decrease in aerobic scope above optimum temperatures is due to a cardiac limitation, triggered by reduced scope for heart rate.Elevated summer river temperatures are associated with high in-river mortality in adult sockeye salmon (<italic>Oncorhynchus nerka</italic>) during their once-in-a-lifetime spawning migration up the Fraser River (British Columbia, Canada). However, the mechanisms underlying the decrease in whole-animal performance and cardiorespiratory collapse above optimal temperatures for aerobic scope (<italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub>) remain elusive for aquatic ectotherms. This is in part because all the relevant cardiorespiratory variables have rarely been measured directly and simultaneously during exercise at supra-optimal temperatures. Using the oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance hypothesis as a framework, this study simultaneously and directly measured oxygen consumption rate (<italic>M</italic>O<sub>2</sub>), cardiac output <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="COT008IM1" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, heart rate (<italic>f</italic><sub>H</sub>), and cardiac stroke volume (<italic>V</italic><sub>s</sub>), as well as arterial and venous blood oxygen status in adult sockeye salmon swimming at temperatures that bracketed <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> to elucidate possible limitations in oxygen uptake into the blood or internal delivery through the oxygen cascade. Above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub>, the decline in <italic>M</italic>O<sub>2max</sub> and aerobic scope was best explained by a cardiac limitation, triggered by reduced scope for <italic>f</italic><sub>H</sub>. The highest test temperatures were characterized by a negative scope for <italic>f</italic><sub>H</sub>, dramatic decreases in maximal <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="COT008IM2" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and maximal <italic>V</italic><sub>s</sub>, and cardiac dysrhythmias. In contrast, arterial blood oxygen content and partial pressure were almost insensitive to supra-optimal temperature, suggesting that oxygen delivery to and uptake by the gill were not a limiting factor. We propose that the high-temperature-induced <italic>en route</italic> mortality in migrating sockeye salmon may be at least partly attributed to physiological limitations in aerobic performance due to cardiac collapse via insufficient scope for <italic>f</italic><sub>H</sub>. Furthermore, this improved mechanistic understanding of cardiorespiratory collapse at high temperature is likely to have broader application to other salmonids and perhaps other aquatic ectotherms.Temperature has been coined the â€˜ecological master factorâ€™ for ectotherms because of its influence on the biochemistry, physiology, behaviour, and ecology of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C35">Fry, 1971</xref>). The optimal temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub>) window for performance may be narrow in stenotherms, such as sockeye salmon (<italic>Oncorhynchus nerka</italic>), or broad in eurytherms, such as killifish (<italic>Fundulus heteroclitus</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C22">Eliason <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C40">Healy and Schulte, 2012</xref>). Outside of the <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> window, whole-animal performance declines until death eventually occurs. The <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> for aerobic scope has been established as a useful metric for the successful return of adult sockeye salmon to their natal spawning areas in the Fraser River watershed (British Columbia, Canada; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C30">Farrell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Indeed, <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> appears to be locally adapted among sockeye salmon populations to the temperatures that they are likely to encounter once they enter the river (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C22">Eliason <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Peak summer river temperatures have increased by around 2Â°C since the 1950s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C61">Patterson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), forcing salmon to migrate at temperatures warmer than their <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> for aerobic scope. Biotelemetry studies have shown that high river temperature is correlated with excessive (&gt;70%) mortality among migrating salmon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C13">Crossin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C30">Farrell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C56">Mathes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C54">Martins <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Clearly, a conservation concern exists for future salmon migrations in this and other watersheds. As a result, there is great interest in the mechanism(s) underlying the decline of whole-animal performance and cardiorespiratory collapse above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub>.Physiological processes are critical in defining thermal limits and temperature-induced mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C81">Wang and Overgaard, 2007</xref>). Aerobic scope, defined as the difference between maximal oxygen consumption (<italic>M</italic>O<sub>2max</sub>) and resting oxygen consumption (<italic>M</italic>O<sub>2rest</sub>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C34">Fry, 1947</xref>), represents the amount of oxygen available for activity. By definition, aerobic scope remains largely unchanged from its maximum within a defined <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> window. However, at the critical temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>crit</sub>), when <italic>M</italic>O<sub>2rest</sub> and <italic>M</italic>O<sub>2max</sub> intersect, aerobic scope is zero and survival becomes passive, time limited, and supported by anaerobic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C63">PÃ¶rtner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C65">PÃ¶rtner and Farrell, 2008</xref>), a situation clearly incompatible with a highly aerobic upriver migration. Here we were specifically interested in which process triggers the decline in aerobic scope at a supra-optimal temperature. In the context of the present study, the term <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> refers to the optimal temperature for aerobic scope.While it is unclear what determines the limits of upper thermal tolerance in ectotherms, one leading possibility is the oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) hypothesis, which attributes the decline in aerobic scope above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> to capacity limitations of the organ systems delivering oxygen to the tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C63">PÃ¶rtner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C64">PÃ¶rtner and Knust, 2007</xref>). Several studies with aquatic ectotherms have found support for the OCLTT hypothesis (e.g. fish and invertebrates; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C33">Frederich and PÃ¶rtner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C52">Mark <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C49">Lannig <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C64">PÃ¶rtner and Knust, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C65">PÃ¶rtner and Farrell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C22">Eliason <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C79">Verberk and Calosi, 2012</xref>), while recent studies with pink salmon (<italic>Oncorhynchus gorbuscha</italic>), an intertidal snail (<italic>Echinolittorina malaccana</italic>), and an air-breathing toad (<italic>Rhinella marina</italic>) found little support for the OCLTT hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C12">Clark <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C53">Marshall <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C60">Overgaard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). According to the OCLTT hypothesis, any one of the five major steps in the oxygen cascade from the environment to the mitochondria might trigger the collapse above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> (i.e. oxygen delivery by gill ventilation, oxygen diffusion across the gills, oxygen transport via the circulatory system, oxygen diffusion across tissue capillaries, and oxygen use by mitochondria; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C82">Weibel, 1984</xref>). However, simultaneous and preferably direct measurements of <italic>M</italic>O<sub>2</sub>, cardiac output <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="COT008IM3" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, heart rate (<italic>f</italic><sub>H</sub>), and cardiac stroke volume (<italic>V</italic><sub>s</sub>), as well as arterial and venous blood oxygen status [partial pressure (<italic>P</italic><sub>O2</sub>) and content (<italic>C</italic><sub>O2</sub>)] are required to discover the initial limitation in the oxygen cascade that triggers the decline in aerobic scope above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub>. For example, a limitation in either oxygen delivery to or oxygen diffusion across the gill would be manifest by a decrease in arterial <italic>P</italic><sub>O2</sub> (<italic>P</italic><sub>aO2</sub>) and arterial <italic>C</italic><sub>O2</sub> (<italic>C</italic><sub>aO2</sub>). Alternatively, a cardiac limitation would be indicated by a failure of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="COT008IM4" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to increase to match the increased tissue oxygen demand above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub>. Finally, a limitation in oxygen diffusion to mitochondria in the working muscles would be indicated by venous <italic>P</italic><sub>O2</sub> (<italic>P</italic><sub>vO2</sub>) remaining constant with increased tissue oxygen demand above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub>. However, support for a single limiting site in the oxygen cascade of fish (gills, heart, or locomotory muscle) remains incomplete despite considerable analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C6">Brett, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C41">Heath and Hughes, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C76">Taylor <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C77">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C28">Farrell, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C74">Steinhausen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C32">Farrell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). This data gap exists because most studies examining temperature effects on aerobic scope in fish have not directly measured all the required variables (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C34">Fry, 1947</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C6">Brett, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C76">Taylor <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>), and the more comprehensive studies only used resting fish, thus failing to examine aerobic scope (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C41">Heath and Hughes, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C9">Cech <italic>et al.</italic>, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C70">Sartoris <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C38">Gollock <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C11">Clark <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C47">Keen and Gamperl, 2012</xref>). In fact, only <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C74">Steinhausen <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> have directly measured all the required variables as a function of temperature in exercising fish.The objective of this study was to examine the mechanism(s) that triggers the decline in <italic>M</italic>O<sub>2max</sub> and aerobic scope above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> in sockeye salmon. Previous work suggested that sockeye salmon thermal limits are set by physiological limitations in aerobic performance, which may possibly be due to cardiac collapse at high temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C74">Steinhausen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C22">Eliason <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C22">Eliason <italic>et al.</italic> (2011)</xref> did not systematically examine all the possible mechanisms leading to cardiorespiratory collapse (only aerobic scope, cardiac scope, scope for heart rate, <italic>M</italic>O<sub>2rest</sub>, and <italic>M</italic>O<sub>2max</sub> were reported as a function of temperature), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C74">Steinhausen <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> only swam sockeye salmon up to âˆ¼75% of their critical swim speed (<italic>U</italic><sub>crit</sub>). Thus, the present study reports the first simultaneous and direct measurements of all the pertinent oxygen transport variables in adult sockeye salmon swimming maximally below, at, and above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt.</sub> Novel data on <italic>M</italic>O<sub>2</sub>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="COT008IM5" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <italic>f</italic><sub>H</sub>, and <italic>V</italic><sub>s</sub>, as well as arterial and venous <italic>P</italic><sub>O2</sub>, <italic>C</italic><sub>O2</sub>, and blood chemistry are presented. We hypothesize that a limitation on <italic>f</italic><sub>H</sub> triggers cardiorespiratory collapse when temperature exceeds <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> for aerobic scope.All procedures were approved by the University of British Columbia's Animal Care Committee (Animal use protocols A06-0328 and A08-0388) in accordance with guidelines recommended through the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Wild adult sockeye salmon (<italic>n</italic>â€…=â€…55; body mass, 2380â€…Â±â€…60â€…g; fork length, 59.6â€…Â±â€…0.4â€…cm) were collected in 2007, 2008, and 2009 early in their upriver spawning migration (âˆ¼100â€…km upstream of the Fraser River mouth) and transported to the Fisheries and Oceans Canada Cultus Lake Research Laboratory (Cultus Lake, BC, Canada), where experiments were conducted. All fish were given a unique PIT (Passive Integrated Transponder; Biomark Inc., Boise, ID, USA) tag for individual identification, a scale was removed, and &lt;0.1â€…g of the adipose fin was clipped for population identification via DNA analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C2">Beacham <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Only fish from Early Stuart (<italic>n</italic>â€…=â€…21), Chilko (<italic>n</italic>â€…=â€…22), and Quensel (<italic>n</italic>â€…=â€…12) populations were used in the present study. Fish were held at 11â€“12Â°C for 1â€“4â€…weeks in outdoor 8000â€“12â€…000â€…l circular aquaria under seasonal photoperiod.Individual fish were anaesthetized with buffered tricaine methanesulfonate in freshwater (0.2â€…gâ€…l<sup>âˆ’1</sup> NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and 0.1â€…gâ€…l<sup>âˆ’1</sup> MS-222; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), weighed, and transferred onto wet foam on a surgical table, where their gills were continuously irrigated with aerated, chilled freshwater with a lower dose of buffered anaesthetic (0.15â€…gâ€…l<sup>âˆ’1</sup> NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and 0.075â€…gâ€…l<sup>âˆ’1</sup> MS-222). Surgical procedures have been detailed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C74">Steinhausen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C22">Eliason <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Fish were instrumented with a 3â€…mm SB flowprobe (lateral cable exit; Transonic Systems, Ithaca, NY, USA) around the ventral aorta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C73">Steffensen and Farrell, 1998</xref>) to measure <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="COT008IM6" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <italic>f</italic><sub>H</sub>, and <italic>V</italic><sub>s</sub>. Cannulae made of PE-50 tubing were inserted into the dorsal aorta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C71">Soivio <italic>et al.</italic>, 1973</xref>) and sinus venosus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C27">Farrell and Clutterham, 2003</xref>) to sample arterial and venous blood, respectively, for measurement of oxygen status and blood chemistry.Three days prior to the swimming test, most fish were placed in a 1400â€…l circular tank, and the temperature was progressively increased from the holding temperature (11â€“12Â°C) to the test temperature (12â€“22Â°C) by no more than 5Â°C day<sup>âˆ’1</sup>. The fish were maintained at their test temperature for 24â€“48â€…h before surgery was conducted. Following surgery, the fish were placed individually in one of two Brett-type swim tunnels (described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C51">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C74">Steinhausen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) and allowed to recover overnight (&gt;8â€…h) at their test temperature (12â€“22Â°C) at a low water velocity of âˆ¼0.39 body lengths per second (blâ€…s<sup>âˆ’1</sup>). Resting measurements of all variables were made following overnight recovery from surgery in the swim tunnel. Fish then underwent two sequential ramp-<italic>U</italic><sub>crit</sub> swim protocols with a 45â€… min recovery in between (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C43">Jain <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C51">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C22">Eliason <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Only data from the first swim are used here.Fish could not be held at the temperature extremes due to logistical constraints on temperature regulation in the holding tanks. Therefore, some fish recovered overnight (&gt;8â€…h) from surgery in the swim tunnel at the holding temperature (12Â°C); initial resting values were measured at this temperature in the morning, and then the water temperature was increased or decreased by 4Â°C h<sup>âˆ’1</sup> to the test temperature of either 8â€“10 or 22â€“26Â°C. One hour after reaching the test temperature, resting variables were recorded, and the fish underwent a single ramp-<italic>U</italic><sub>crit</sub> swim challenge.The <italic>M</italic>O<sub>2</sub> was measured during the second half of every 20â€…min velocity interval using an Oxyguard probe (Point Four Systems, Richmond, BC, Canada) attached to a Windaq box (Dataq Instruments, Akron, ON, USA) interfaced with Labview software (version 6.0; National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA). The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="COT008IM7" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was measured continuously at 200â€…Hz throughout the swim trials by connecting the flowprobe to a flowmeter (Transonic Systems) interfaced with Biopac hardware and Acknowledge software (Biopac Systems, Santa Barbara, CA, USA). The value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="COT008IM8" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was calculated as the mean of three to six segments of continuous 30â€…s traces. Blood was strategically sampled prior to the swim test (rest), during steady-state swimming (steady), once the fish had transitioned to burst-and-coast swimming (burst), and immediately following the swim test within 5â€…min of fatigue (fatigue).Partial pressure of oxygen (<italic>P</italic><sub>O2</sub>), oxygen content (<italic>C</italic><sub>O2</sub>), haemoglobin concentration ([Hb]), and haematocrit (Hct) were measured using whole blood samples. Blood <italic>P</italic><sub>O2</sub> was measured using a blood gas monitor (PHM 73; Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark), which was calibrated and maintained at the experimental temperature using a water jacket. Blood <italic>C</italic><sub>O2</sub> was measured according to the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C78">Tucker (1967)</xref>. The [Hb] was measured using either a handheld haemoglobin analyser (HemoCue 201<sup>+</sup>; Ã„ngelholm, Sweden) calibrated for fish blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C10">Clark <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008a</xref>) or the spectrophotometer method with Drabkin's solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C17">Drabkin and Austin, 1935</xref>). Haematocrit was measured in duplicate using microhaematocrit capillary tubes spun at 10â€…000<italic>g</italic>. The remaining blood was centrifuged at 7000<italic>g</italic>, and the plasma was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at âˆ’80Â°C for subsequent analyses.

As a result, cardiac scope was lowest for the <italic>T</italic><sub>max0â€“50</sub> grouping (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COT008F2">2</xref>F).Stroke volume at rest was independent of temperature except for a quantitatively small, but statistically significant decrease at <italic>T</italic><sub>max0â€“50</sub> when compared with <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COT008F2">2</xref>C). Scope for <italic>V</italic><sub>s</sub> was maintained between the <italic>T</italic><sub>min50â€“90</sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub>max50â€“90</sub> groupings, but decreased significantly for the <italic>T</italic><sub>max0â€“50</sub> grouping when <italic>V</italic><sub>smax</sub> also decreased significantly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COT008F2">2</xref>C and G).While <italic>f</italic><sub>Hrest</sub> increased progressively with each temperature grouping (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COT008F2">2</xref>D), <italic>f</italic><sub>Hmax</sub> increased with temperature only up to the <italic>T</italic><sub>max50â€“90</sub> grouping, plateauing between <italic>T</italic><sub>max50â€“90</sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub>max0â€“50</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COT008F2">2</xref>D).

Values are meansâ€…Â±â€…SEM. Temperature groupings with different letters within a swimming speed are statistically different, and an asterisk indicates a statically significant difference from rest within a temperature grouping (<italic>P</italic>â€…&lt;â€…0.05).Unlike arterial blood, <italic>P</italic><sub>vO2</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>vO2</sub> both varied significantly with temperature and swimming (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COT008TB1">1</xref>). The changes in <italic>C</italic><sub>vO2</sub> directly reflected changes in haemoglobin saturation, because [Hb] was unchanged (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COT008TB3">3</xref>). The effect of temperature on resting <italic>P</italic><sub>vO2</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>vO2</sub> was profound. Indeed, resting <italic>P</italic><sub>vO2</sub> for the <italic>T</italic><sub>max0â€“50</sub> grouping was 10â€…torr, 25% of the <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> value, and resting <italic>C</italic><sub>vO2</sub> was only 16â€“20% of the <italic>C</italic><sub>vO2</sub> for the other three temperature groupings. When temperature was treated as a continuous independent variable, the significant polynomial relationships also revealed decreases in resting <italic>P</italic><sub>vO2</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>vO2</sub> at the highest temperature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COT008F8">8</xref>).Swimming increased muscle oxygen extraction from the blood, as reflected by decreases of <italic>P</italic><sub>vO2</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>vO2</sub> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COT008TB1">1</xref>). At fatigue, <italic>C</italic><sub>vO2</sub> and <italic>P</italic><sub>vO2</sub> were 114 and 77%, respectively, lower in the <italic>T</italic><sub>max50â€“90</sub> grouping compared with <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub>. Likewise, the significant polynomial relationship with temperature for both <italic>P</italic><sub>vO2</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>vO2</sub> at fatigue further illustrates the point that tissue oxygen extraction must have increased above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COT008F8">8</xref>). Tissue oxygen extraction (<italic>A</italic>â€“<italic>V</italic><sub>O2</sub>) was calculated only for individuals with paired, simultaneous arterial and venous samples. The tendency for <italic>A</italic>â€“<italic>V</italic><sub>O2</sub> to increase with swimming and at warmer temperatures did not reach statistical significance, probably due to low statistical power (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COT008TB1">1</xref>).Even though the tissues extracted more oxygen from the blood with swimming, the amount of oxygen leaving the tissues and returning to the heart (venous oxygen transport; <italic>T</italic><sub>vO2</sub>) was independent of swimming effort at <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COT008TB1">1</xref>). Thus, the increase in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="COT008IM31" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> matched the decrease in <italic>C</italic><sub>vO2</sub>. However, this situation changed at supra-optimal temperatures, because <italic>T</italic><sub>vO2</sub> significantly decreased at burst and fatigue for the <italic>T</italic><sub>max50â€“90</sub> grouping (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COT008TB1">1</xref>). Even at rest, <italic>T</italic><sub>vO2</sub> was reduced by over 4-fold in the <italic>T</italic><sub>max0â€“50</sub> grouping compared with <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COT008TB1">1</xref>).Plasma lactate varied significantly with both temperature and swimming (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COT008TB3">3</xref>). The effect of supra-optimal temperatures on plasma lactate was profound, because resting plasma lactate was &gt;3-fold higher in the <italic>T</italic><sub>max0â€“50</sub> grouping compared with <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COT008TB3">3</xref>). This result suggests that oxygen supply was insufficient to meet tissue oxygen demand even at rest for the highest test temperature. As expected, burst swimming to fatigue increased plasma lactate by 2- to 4-fold relative to resting levels for all temperature groupings. Moreover, plasma lactate was highest in fish at <italic>T</italic><sub>max50â€“90</sub> at fatigue compared with the other groups (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COT008TB3">3</xref>). Plasma glucose was independent of temperature and swimming, except for a significant decrease in plasma glucose with swimming for the <italic>T</italic><sub>max0â€“50</sub> grouping (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COT008TB3">3</xref>), perhaps reflecting a greater drain on this fuel for anaerobic metabolism.Plasma sodium varied significantly with both temperature and swimming speed (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COT008TB3">3</xref>), tending to be highest for the <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> grouping and increasing with swimming speed for the <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub>max50â€“90</sub> groupings. Plasma chloride also varied significantly with temperature, but not with swimming speed (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COT008TB3">3</xref>), and was significantly higher at <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> relative to the <italic>T</italic><sub>max0â€“50</sub> grouping. Plasma potassium did not vary significantly with temperature (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COT008TB3">3</xref>), but tended to decrease with swimming speed, and was lowest at fatigue.In order to apply physiological knowledge to conservation problems, scientists require a mechanistic understanding and the support of guiding principles. The present study sought to make such a contribution by examining the mechanism of the decline in <italic>M</italic>O<sub>2max</sub> and aerobic scope above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> in sockeye salmon using the OCLTT hypothesis as a framework. Earlier temperature studies with fishes either did not measure all the required variables (i.e. <italic>M</italic>O<sub>2</sub>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="COT008IM32" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <italic>C</italic><sub>aO2</sub>, and <italic>C</italic><sub>vO2</sub>) or the fish were not swum maximally, if at all. For example, many studies have examined the collapse of cardiorespiratory performance during warming of resting fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C41">Heath and Hughes, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C9">Cech <italic>et al.</italic>, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C70">Sartoris <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C38">Gollock <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C11">Clark <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C47">Keen and Gamperl, 2012</xref>), but their results relate to what is triggering events close to <italic>T</italic><sub>crit</sub> as opposed to the collapse of aerobic scope above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C6">Brett (1971)</xref> first described a parallel association of swimming performance, aerobic scope, and cardiac scope as a function of temperature between 5 and 22Â°C. He noted a decrease in aerobic scope, cardiac scope, and scope for heart rate above a <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> of 15Â°C. However, was calculated using the Fick principle, and Brett concluded that the cardiorespiratory collapse above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> was likely to be due to limited oxygen availability, even though blood gases were not reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C5">Brett, 1964</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C6">1971</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C76">Taylor <italic>et al.</italic> (1996)</xref> examined aerobic swimming of rainbow trout at three acclimation temperatures (4, 11, and 18Â°C), and indirectly estimated <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="COT008IM33" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> using microspheres. By coupling these cardiac measurements with an earlier study of blood gases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C75">Taylor <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>), they concluded that aerobic swimming performance may have been limited at high temperature because of numerous factors, including reduced oxygen solubility in water and plasma, decreased arterial blood oxygen content and haematocrit, elevated energy expenditure for reproduction, reduced aerobic muscle mass or decreased cardiac scope, and reduced blood flow to swimming muscles. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C74">Steinhausen <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> was the first to measure <italic>M</italic>O<sub>2</sub>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="COT008IM34" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <italic>C</italic><sub>aO2</sub>, and <italic>C</italic><sub>vO2</sub> simultaneously and directly in sockeye salmon as they were progressively warmed from 15 to 24Â°C while swimming steadily at âˆ¼1.35â€…blâ€…s<sup>âˆ’1</sup> or âˆ¼75% of maximum. They concluded that a cardiac limitation developed at warm temperatures in swimming fish, because <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="COT008IM35" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <italic>f</italic><sub>H</sub>, and <italic>T</italic><sub>aO2</sub> reached maxima and failed to continue to increase with increasing temperatures in order to meet the increased tissue oxygen demand.The present study is the most comprehensive assessment to date of aerobic scope and the associated cardiovascular and blood gas variables across a range of temperatures in an aquatic ectotherm. We conclude that a limitation in maximal cardiac performance inhibits <italic>M</italic>O<sub>2max</sub> and aerobic scope at supra-optimal temperatures in salmonids, which is apparently triggered by a precipitous decrease in scope for <italic>f</italic><sub>H</sub>. Thus, the present study with sockeye salmon found support for the OCLTT hypothesis, though we caution that the OCLTT hypothesis may not be broadly applicable to all ectotherms [e.g. pink salmon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C12">Clark <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), intertidal snails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C53">Marshall <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>)<italic>,</italic> and air-breathing toads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C60">Overgaard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>)] and warrants further investigation. Of particular conservation concern for sockeye salmon is the additional finding that post-fatigue mortality occurred at temperatures only 3â€“5Â°C above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub>.Salmonids are known to increase their reliance on anaerobic swimming in <italic>U</italic><sub>crit</sub> tests at supra-optimal temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C5">Brett, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C44">Jain and Farrell, 2003</xref>), a finding that lends support to the OCLTT hypothesis. This was clearly evidenced here by the elevated lactate levels at fatigue in the warmest temperature grouping, supporting the idea that oxygen delivery to tissues in swimming fish becomes limited at temperatures near the critical maximum. A novel finding in the present study was the elevated plasma lactate even at rest and the depletion of plasma glucose with swimming in the highest temperature grouping, providing further indications that tissue oxygen delivery was compromised. The difficulty of swimming at supra-optimal temperature was evident from the increased COT and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="COT008IM37" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with temperature, indicating higher oxygen and cardiovascular costs to swimming at a given speed compared with cooler temperatures. In fact, the true COT and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="COT008IM38" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> may be even higher, because the metabolic costs of anaerobic swimming require the characterization of excess post-exhaustion oxygen consumption (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C50">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003a</xref>), which was not done here.Water oxygen content decreases by around 2% Â°C<sup>âˆ’1</sup> with increasing water temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C15">Dejours, 1975</xref>), which limits environmental oxygen availability. Furthermore, the affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen decreases with increasing temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C62">Perry and Reid, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C46">Jensen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C11">Clark <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008b</xref>), which may hamper oxygen uptake at the gill and potentially prevent full haemoglobin saturation. Therefore, strong theoretical arguments exist for a limitation in oxygen uptake at the gills to explain the collapse of aerobic scope above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> (through either insufficient water delivery to the gills or reduced diffusion of oxygen across the gills). If this were the case, <italic>P</italic><sub>aO2</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>aO2</sub> would decrease and potentially reduce <italic>T</italic><sub>aO2</sub> at temperatures above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub>.There is considerable evidence for such changes in arterial oxygen status in resting, but not in exercising fishes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C47">Keen and Gamperl (2012)</xref> showed a reduction in <italic>C</italic><sub>aO2</sub> and <italic>P</italic><sub>aO2</sub> by âˆ¼25 and 35%, respectively, in resting steelhead trout warmed from 12Â°C to their critical thermal maximum. However, they noted that a limited capacity for ram ventilation in the test apparatus could have been a contributing factor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C11">Clark <italic>et al.</italic> (2008b)</xref> found that resting adult Chinook salmon slightly decreased <italic>C</italic><sub>aO2</sub> and <italic>P</italic><sub>aO2</sub> when acutely warmed, but this was more pronounced in larger individuals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C41">Heath and Hughes (1973)</xref> showed a large and parallel decrease in <italic>C</italic><sub>aO2</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>vO2</sub> with acute heat stress up to 25Â°C in resting rainbow trout, but did not measure Hct or [Hb] to check for haemodilution with repetitive blood sampling. The only report of <italic>C</italic><sub>aO2</sub> becoming lower during swimming was for seasonally acclimatized rainbow trout at 18Â°C when compared with 4 and 11Â°C, but haematocrit was also halved at 18Â°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C75">Taylor <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>).In contrast to these works, both the present study and that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C74">Steinhausen <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> found that <italic>C</italic><sub>aO2</sub>, <italic>P</italic><sub>aO2</sub>, and Hct were maintained independent of temperature in swimming adult sockeye salmon. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C70">Sartoris <italic>et al.</italic> (2003)</xref> found that <italic>P</italic><sub>aO2</sub> remained constant during acute warming in resting Atlantic cod. A telling discovery here was that <italic>C</italic><sub>aO2</sub> was maintained even when cardiac dyssynchrony and post-fatigue delayed mortality occurred at extremely warm temperatures. As such, the present study clearly provides no support for an oxygen limitation developing at the gills at warm temperatures.Given the different conclusions that have been reached for the effects of temperature on oxygen delivery and uptake at the gill, future studies must pay close attention to the response of Hct and [Hb] to temperature, which directly affects <italic>C</italic><sub>aO2</sub>. Haematocrit has been shown to increase by up to 27% due to splenic contraction in acutely warmed resting rainbow trout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C69">Sandblom and Axelsson, 2007</xref>), to decrease by 50% in warm-acclimated rainbow trout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C75">Taylor <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>), and to be minimally affected by temperature (present study and see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C25">Farrell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C11">Clark <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C74">Steinhausen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Future studies must consider haemodilution, because repeated blood sampling can reduce Hct, [Hb], and <italic>C</italic><sub>aO2</sub>, though this was not a problem in the present study. In addition, future studies should carefully consider the role of water velocity in assisting gill ventilation (ram ventilation), as was possible here in the swim tunnels, and the possibility that fish holding devices may restrict buccal and opercular movements during gill ventilation.All studies that have measured <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="COT008IM39" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (directly or indirectly) and <italic>M</italic>O<sub>2</sub> as a function of temperature in swimming salmonids have reported parallel declines in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="COT008IM40" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <italic>M</italic>O<sub>2</sub> above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C6">Brett, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C76">Taylor <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C74">Steinhausen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C22">Eliason <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Here we present additional evidence in support of a cardiac limitation developing at supra-optimal temperatures, because maximal <italic>T</italic><sub>aO2</sub>, <italic>M</italic>O<sub>2</sub>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="COT008IM41" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> all failed to increase above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub>. In addition, all three variables decreased at <italic>T</italic><sub>max0â€“50</sub>, at which point scope for <italic>f</italic><sub>H</sub> completely collapsed without any compensation by <italic>V</italic><sub>s</sub>. Therefore, we conclude that a perfusion limitation develops above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub>, resulting in insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the increased locomotory tissue oxygen demand. Notably, scope for <italic>f</italic><sub>H</sub> collapsed at a lower temperature compared with scope for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="COT008IM42" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, aerobic scope, and scope for <italic>V</italic><sub>s</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COT008F5">5</xref>). Therefore, we propose that reduced scope for <italic>f</italic><sub>H</sub> is the triggering mechanism that limits <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="COT008IM43" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub>, supporting an earlier proposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C31">Farrell, 2009</xref>). It is becoming clear that <italic>f</italic><sub>H</sub> is a central mechanism setting upper temperature tolerance and thus may be a key limiting factor regulating fish distribution globally.Changes in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="COT008IM44" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <italic>T</italic><sub>aO2</sub> as a function of temperature are almost entirely mediated by changes in <italic>f</italic><sub>H</sub> in both resting and swimming fish (present study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C9">Cech <italic>et al.</italic>, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C38">Gollock <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C69">Sandblom and Axelsson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C11">Clark <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C12">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C74">Steinhausen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), underscoring the central importance of <italic>f</italic><sub>H</sub> in determining cardiac performance and oxygen delivery with temperature. More broadly, the central importance of resting <italic>f</italic><sub>H</sub> in setting temperature tolerances for intertidal invertebrates is also gaining support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C72">Somero, 2011</xref>). Direct effects of temperature on the cardiac pacemaker rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C66">Randall, 1970</xref>) are likely to account for temperature-induced cardiac acceleration. Here, resting <italic>f</italic><sub>H</sub> continued to increase until lethal temperatures were approached in the highest temperature group (range, 117â€“135â€…beatsâ€…min<sup>âˆ’1</sup>; mean, 123.9â€…beatsâ€…min<sup>âˆ’1</sup>). Moreover, <italic>f</italic><sub>Hmax</sub> plateaued above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub>, decreasing from rest at the highest test temperatures. Therefore, we suggest that factors that (i) determine <italic>f</italic><sub>Hrest</sub> and (ii) limit <italic>f</italic><sub>Hmax</sub> may be of particular importance for future studies.The bradycardia followed by dysrhythmia in fish swimming at the highest temperature is a novel observation that adds to the observation of irregular heart beats in resting rainbow trout, Atlantic cod, and Chinook salmon acutely warmed to their <italic>T</italic><sub>crit</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C41">Heath and Hughes, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C38">Gollock <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C11">Clark <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008b</xref>). Here, severe dysrhythmias were associated with dramatic decreases in <italic>P</italic><sub>vO2</sub>, <italic>C</italic><sub>vO2</sub>, and <italic>T</italic><sub>vO2</sub>, although these sockeye salmon displayed an impressive tenacity to continue swimming, albeit at lower speeds and with a lower <italic>M</italic>O<sub>2</sub>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="COT008IM48" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <italic>T</italic><sub>aO2</sub>. Such tenacity, however, may have severe consequences, because there was significant post-fatigue mortality shortly after exhaustion despite cooling the salmon. At temperatures a few degrees cooler, there was no such immediate consequence. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of delayed mortality, because it can occur hours to days after exhaustive exercise, both in the laboratory (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C4">Black, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C83">Wood <italic>et al.</italic>, 1983</xref>) and in nature (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C16">Donaldson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), especially at elevated temperature.The mechanisms limiting maximal <italic>f</italic><sub>H</sub> and triggering bradycardia and cardiac dysrhythmia remain unclear. Maximal <italic>f</italic><sub>H</sub> is clearly unable to continue increasing with a <italic>Q</italic><sub>10</sub> of âˆ¼2 at temperatures above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub>. The initial bradycardia during swimming may have been vagally mediated and could act as a protective mechanism by (i) reducing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="COT008IM47" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and cardiac oxygen demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C24">Farrell and Steffensen, 1987</xref>), (ii)â€…increasing blood residence time in the heart to favour oxygen extraction by spongy myocardium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C29">Farrell, 2007b</xref>), and (iii)â€…reducing coronary vascular compression to favour a more continuous coronary blood flow to compact myocardium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C1">Axelsson and Farrell, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C36">Gamperl <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). The possibility of a centrally mediated bradycardia should be examined using atropine injection or vagotomy. Alternatively, synergistically or perhaps secondarily, the deleterious venous blood environment associated with anaerobic swimming at high temperature could have triggered cardiac problems, including the observed decrease in <italic>f</italic><sub>Hmax</sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub>smax</sub>. Specifically, anaerobic swimming makes venous blood acidotic (low pH), hypoxaemic (low <italic>P</italic><sub>vO2</sub>) and hyperkalaemic (high K<sup>+</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C48">Kiceniuk and Jones, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C42">Holk and Lykkeboe, 1998</xref>), all of which become exacerbated at high temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C5">Brett, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C44">Jain and Farrell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C74">Steinhausen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Notably, hyperkalaemia was absent in the present study. These extracellular changes can impair cardiac contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C18">Driedzic and Gesser, 1994</xref>), and even more so at high temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C39">Hanson and Farrell, 2007</xref>). At extremely high temperatures, the decreases in <italic>P</italic><sub>vO2</sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub>vO2</sub> at warm temperatures may not have guaranteed sufficient oxygen supply to the avascular spongy myocardium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C27">Farrell and Clutterham, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C28">Farrell, 2007a</xref>), resulting in reduced contractility and perhaps dysrhythmias. In fact, the lowest <italic>P</italic><sub>vO2</sub> observed at the highest temperature (10â€…torr) is around the suggested lower limit for adequate oxygen delivery to the fish spongy myocardium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C14">Davie and Farrell, 1991</xref>). In contrast, the compact myocardium (supplied with oxygen by the coronary circulation) probably would not have suffered in a similar manner, because <italic>C</italic><sub>aO2</sub> and <italic>P</italic><sub>aO2</sub> were maintained. All told, the exact mechanisms and sequence of events leading to the <italic>f</italic><sub>H</sub> limitation are unclear and warrant further study.Why resting fish do not increase <italic>V</italic><sub>s</sub> with acute warming remains unknown (present study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C9">Cech <italic>et al.</italic>, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C7">Brodeur <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C38">Gollock <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C69">Sandblom and Axelsson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C11">Clark <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C74">Steinhausen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C57">MendonÃ§a and Gamperl, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C37">Gamperl <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Elevated temperature, <italic>per se</italic>, does not prevent an increase in resting <italic>V</italic><sub>s</sub>, because zatebradine treatment, which reduces <italic>f</italic><sub>H</sub> at the level of the pacemaker, triggered a compensatory increase in <italic>V</italic><sub>s</sub> in resting rainbow and steelhead trout at high temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C37">Gamperl <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C47">Keen and Gamperl, 2012</xref>). All the same, supra-optimal temperatures can reduce <italic>V</italic><sub>smax</sub> in swimming salmon (present study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C12">Clark <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), something that was not revealed when sockeye salmon were swimming at âˆ¼75% of <italic>U</italic><sub>crit</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C74">Steinhausen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The mechanism of the decline in <italic>V</italic><sub>smax</sub> at extremely warm temperatures is unknown, but may be related to the deleterious venous blood environment associated with anaerobic swimming at high temperature, as outlined above.The elevation in plasma lactate in both resting and swimming fish is a clear indication that the increased tissue oxygen demand was not being met by oxygen delivery at supra-optimal temperature. This mismatch between oxygen supply and demand could have resulted from a perfusion and/or a diffusion limitation to the locomotory muscles. The present study clearly showed that arterial oxygen transport was compromised above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> due to reduced <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="COT008IM36" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, leading to a muscle capillary perfusion limitation. However, insufficient tissue oxygen extraction could also lead to increased anaerobic metabolism if a diffusion limitation for oxygen existed at the locomotory muscles. Factors leading to a diffusion limitation are inadequate capillary density, ineffective muscle cellular morphology (e.g. poor mitochondria density or location), and an insufficient driving force for oxygen diffusion (low <italic>P</italic><sub>aO2</sub>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C20">Egginton and Cordiner, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C77">Taylor <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C21">Egginton, 2002</xref>). Thus, a diffusion limitation for oxygen is more likely for white rather than red muscle given the attendant âˆ¼10â€…times lower capillary density of white compared with red muscle in salmonids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C58">Mosse, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C19">Egginton and Sidell, 1989</xref>). However, none of these morphometric features was studied here, and so assessing the role of a diffusion limitation relative to a perfusion limitation is difficult with <italic>in vivo</italic> studies.Nevertheless, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C74">Steinhausen <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> suggested that a constant <italic>P</italic><sub>vO2</sub> during acute warming of resting and swimming sockeye salmon was evidence for a diffusion limitation. However, <italic>P</italic><sub>vO2</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>vO2</sub> both decreased above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> in resting and maximally swimming sockeye salmon in the present study. Likewise, <italic>P</italic><sub>vO2</sub> and/or <italic>C</italic><sub>vO2</sub> decreased with warming to high temperature in resting rainbow trout, Atlantic cod, and Chinook salmon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C41">Heath and Hughes, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C70">Sartoris <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C11">Clark <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008b</xref>). Thus, a tissue diffusion limitation may not have occurred immediately, because the tissues were able to extract more oxygen from the blood at temperatures above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub>. We caution, however, that the decrease in <italic>C</italic><sub>vO2</sub> may not have been proportional to the increased oxygen demand with warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C80">Wagner, 1996</xref>). Assessments of a diffusion limitation are complicated by the decrease in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="COT008IM45" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which potentially slows capillary transit time for blood, favouring oxygen diffusion. Furthermore, the decrease in blood pH accompanying anaerobic metabolism, which may facilitate oxygen unloading into the tissues via Bohr and Root effects, would provide further temporary relief from a diffusion limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C68">Rummer and Brauner, 2011</xref>). All told, further research examining the possibility of a tissue diffusion limitation at warm temperature is warranted. Specifically, studies on the role of muscle morphology in limiting oxygen diffusion at high temperature in exercising fish remain a ripe area for future research.This study overcame the difficult challenge of swimming a sufficient number of large fish equipped with cannulae and probes to measure critical cardiorespiratory variables directly and simultaneously in order to resolve the subtle changes in the oxygen cascade when fish swim above supra-optimal temperature. Adult sockeye salmon have proved to be an effective model, because they are large enough to carry a flow probe and support repeated but strategic arterial and venous blood sampling without haemodilution. However, migrating adult sockeye salmon naturally senesce and die 4â€“6â€…weeks after they enter freshwater, which places a logistic constraint on the duration of recovery periods. Previous work has shown that <italic>M</italic>O<sub>2rest</sub>, <italic>M</italic>O<sub>2max</sub>, and aerobic scope did not differ significantly between sockeye salmon that had undergone surgery and those that had not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C23">Eliason <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), suggesting that sockeye salmon can recover quickly from surgery.Another challenge with wild Fraser River sockeye salmon is that different populations co-migrate upstream, and individual fish are impossible to differentiate until scale and DNA analysis have been conducted several days later. Therefore, in order to ensure good statistical power, we pooled three sockeye salmon populations that all face long and difficult river migrations, have a similar <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> for aerobic scope (âˆ¼17Â°C), and have a similar maximal aerobic scope, cardiac scope, and scope for heart rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C22">Eliason <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). These three populations do not differ in <italic>M</italic>O<sub>2</sub>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="COT008IM46" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <italic>f</italic><sub>H</sub>, or <italic>V</italic><sub>s</sub> at rest, when swimming, or during recovery at <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub>. Also, great care was taken to create temperature groupings relative to the population-specific <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> such that the temperature differences were only 1â€“3Â°C across the populations within a temperature grouping above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub>. As a result, the variances for <italic>M</italic>O<sub>2rest</sub>, <italic>M</italic>O<sub>2max</sub>, and aerobic scope were small for each temperature grouping (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COT008F2">2</xref>), which would not be the case if large population differences existed. Moreover, the Chilko population had temperature responses that paralleled those for the four temperature groupings (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COT008F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COT008F6">6</xref>).Given the above constraints, sex-specific differences were not considered, but each temperature grouping contained approximately equal numbers of male and female sockeye salmon. Previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C23">Eliason <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) found no sex-specific differences in cardiorespiratory physiology and blood oxygen status at <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> for sockeye salmon, while a study on pink salmon showed that males maintain a higher <italic>M</italic>O<sub>2rest</sub> and achieve greater <italic>M</italic>O<sub>2max</sub>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="COT008IM17" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and aerobic scope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C12">Clark <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Notably, female sockeye salmon suffer higher mortality compared with males in stressful migratory conditions, such as high temperature, elevated flow, and challenging migratory obstacles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C59">Nadeau <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C67">Roscoe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C45">Jeffries <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C55">Martins <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Given that spawning success for a population is governed by females, this raises potential conservation concerns for any sex differences in the physiological response to temperature, which should be considered in future studies.The results from the present study greatly expand upon the idea of a â€˜death spiralâ€™ for salmon swimming at supra-optimal temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C32">Farrell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), which proposes a mechanistic explanation of the failure of aerobic scope above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub>. Here we provide definitive evidence that the collapse of aerobic scope above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> is associated with a cardiac limitation, triggered by a collapse in scope for <italic>f</italic><sub>H</sub>. Accordingly, a perfusion limitation for oxygen delivery to swimming muscles developed at temperatures above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub>, resulting in a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand, as evidenced by elevated lactate levels. The severity of the cardiac constraint increased with temperature to the point that elevated resting lactate, cardiac dysrhythmias, a negative scope for <italic>f</italic><sub>H</sub>, and even post-exhaustion mortality were observed at the highest temperatures. Both <italic>P</italic><sub>aO2</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>aO2</sub> were unchanged with warming above <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub>, suggesting no limitation in oxygen uptake at the gill with the present experimental design. With <italic>P</italic><sub>vO2</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>vO2</sub> (and probably blood pH, given the elevation in plasma lactate) decreasing at the highest test temperature, the possibility of a diffusion limitation also developing at the muscle remains unclear and warrants further study. We propose that a noxious venous blood environment (low pH and low <italic>P</italic><sub>vO2</sub>) further impairs cardiac function (reducing cardiac oxygen delivery, contractility, and perhaps <italic>f</italic><sub>H</sub>), which could initiate a positive feedback loop to exacerbate the perfusion limitation to locomotory muscle and perhaps lead to delayed mortality at extremely warm temperatures.In terms of salmon conservation, climate change-induced increases in Fraser River temperatures have been associated with massive mortality in sockeye salmon during their spawning migration. Nevertheless, a detailed mechanistic understanding of the causes of migration failure has remained elusive. Previous work suggests that the high <italic>en route</italic> mortality may be partly attributed to a decrease in aerobic scope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C30">Farrell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C22">Eliason <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The present study expands on this idea and suggests that salmon are unable to swim at warm temperature due to a decrease in aerobic scope caused by a cardiac limitation via insufficient scope for heart rate. While some populations of sockeye salmon have an exceptionally wide <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> window (e.g. from 13 to 21Â°C for Chilko sockeye salmon; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C22">Eliason <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), all populations studied to date are currently experiencing temperatures that exceed their population-specific <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> window, and this is expected only to worsen in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C22">Eliason <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The central importance of <italic>f</italic><sub>H</sub> in determining cardiac performance and oxygen delivery at warm temperature and the possibility of <italic>f</italic><sub>Hmax</sub> setting upper temperature limits may provide a useful, but simple measurement to move physiology into the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT008C8">Casselman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) and improve our knowledge of temperature tolerance of fishes as we try to conserve the natural resources that are left.A.
