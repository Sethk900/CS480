Polarization of visible light by desert pavementsDesert pavements can be detected through multi-spectral polarization measurements of reflected sunlight both in and out of the solar principle plane. The combination of polarization and color distinguishes desert pavements from other desert landforms and vegetation. Desert pavements linearly polarize and impart a blueness to sunlight reflected at visible wavelengths. The polarization and color of skylight reflected at high emission angles is also preserved. The polarization properties of desert pavements are dominated by Fresnel reflection at large phase angles and by multiple scattering at low phase angles, causing significant positive and small negative polarization, respectively.
