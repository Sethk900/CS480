Estimated performance shifts corresponding to recent warming broadly concur with observed abundance shifts. Performance metrics may better predict responses to climate change than coarser and oft-used proxies such as thermal tolerance.To what extent is insect hopping and feeding performance, which constrains the ability to obtain and assimilate resources, thermally adapted along an elevation gradient? Does temperature dependence vary between populations and species and can differences account for individualistic responses to past climate change? We investigate these questions for three species of grasshoppers along a Rocky Mountain elevation gradient. All species and populations exhibit warm adaptation for consumption and digestion, with only modest inter- and intra-specific differences. Species differ substantially in the temperature of peak hopping performance. Low-elevation populations of the warm-adapted species exhibit the highest performance at high temperatures and the lowest performance at low temperatures. Developmental plasticity influences the temperature dependence of performance; grasshoppers reared at higher temperatures perform better at higher temperatures and possess broader thermal tolerance. We fitted thermal performance curves to examine whether performance shifts can account for changes in abundance between initial surveys in 1958â€“1960 and recent surveys since 2006. All species and populations are able to achieve greater feeding rates now. Estimated shifts in hopping performance vary between species and along the elevation gradient. The cool-adapted species has experienced declines in hopping performance, particularly at the lower elevation sites, while the warm-adapted species has experienced increases in performance concentrated at higher elevations. These estimated performance shifts broadly concur with observed abundance shifts. Performance metrics may have a greater potential to elucidate differential responses to climate change between populations and species than coarser and oft-used proxies, such as thermal tolerance. Assessing performance directly when temperature dependence varies between processes such as the acquisition and assimilation of energy may be essential to understanding population- and species-level impacts.Environmental temperature can constrain ectothermic organisms by limiting their ability to locate, gather, consume and assimilate resources. These processes follow a hump-shaped rate function (thermal performance curve, TPC), with performance being optimal at an intermediate body temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C23">Huey and Kingsolver, 1989</xref>). Local adaptation in TPCs has been widely observed along elevation and latitudinal gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C4">Angilletta, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C28">Kingsolver, 2009</xref>), particularly for insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C20">Hodkinson, 2005</xref>). This dependence of performance and fitness on temperature has been used effectively as a basis for understanding and predicting the ecological impacts of climate change on populations and species. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C24">Huey <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)</xref> predicted declining performance for a cool-adapted tropical lizard in response to climate warming over recent decades. Related analyses suggest that restrictions in lizard performance and activity duration associated with climate change drive extinctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C44">Sinervo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>) and range shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C6">Buckley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C26">Kearney, 2012</xref>).Latitudinal and altitudinal patterns of thermal specialization and adaptation shape sensitivity to climate change. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C15">Deutsch <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> predicted that detrimental effects of climate shifts would be most intense in tropical species with narrow thermal specialization, despite the lesser magnitude of climate change experienced. Subsequent analyses suggest that more variable temperate climates may increase the incidence of thermal stress events and equalize the impacts of climate change across latitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C30">Kingsolver <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Acclimatization and adaptation of temperature-dependent performance traits is important for understanding future responses to warming climates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C21">Hofmann and Todgham, 2010</xref>) and identifying species most vulnerable to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C25">Huey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).Many analyses of the potential impacts of climate change rely on physiological metrics that are easy to measure, such as critical thermal minima and maxima (CT<sub>min</sub> and CT<sub>max</sub>); however, the body temperatures of organisms rarely approach CT<sub>min</sub> and CT<sub>max</sub> in nature owing to the severe thermal stress experienced at these extreme temperatures. Researchers often use CT<sub>min</sub> and CT<sub>max</sub> to estimate TPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C4">Angilletta, 2009</xref>) and thus responses to more ecologically relevant temperatures, but the ecological significance of CT<sub>min</sub> and CT<sub>max</sub> remains questionable.Phenological and abundance shifts by grasshoppers along a 2000â€…m elevation gradient near Boulder (CO, USA) in response to climate change over the last 50â€…years have varied in extent and direction among populations and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C35">Nufio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Thermal tolerances, thermal preferences and metabolic rate responses varied among species, but inter-population differences were insufficient to account for the individualistic responses to past climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C8">Buckley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013b</xref>). Grasshoppers, however, exhibit a pronounced temperature dependence in hopping activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C19">Harrison <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>) and feeding behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C18">Harrison and Fewell, 1995</xref>). Thus, in the present study we test whether TPCs for hopping and feeding differ within and among three species along the above elevation gradient and then consider whether these performance measures can account for the individualistic responses to observed climate change. This addresses whether more refined performance metrics offer greater promise for understanding differential responses to climate change than cruder thermal tolerance metrics.Finally, we examine the influence of developmental plasticity in shaping TPCs by rearing grasshoppers in a range of constant temperatures. Thermal performance curve are more likely to be developmentally plastic when environmental conductions during development are indicative of those experienced later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C29">Kingsolver and Huey, 1998</xref>). Plasticity in thermal traits along elevation gradients are likely to be complex, because high-altitude sites, while generally colder, are more variable, with high levels of radiation producing short periods of high body temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C7">Buckley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013a</xref>). Mean environmental conditions and extreme events combine to influence the position, breadth and shape of TPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C42">Schulte <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). We examine developmental plasticity in TPCs, which provides insight into whether acclimatization of TPCs will contribute to responses to thermal stress.Overview of the focal grasshopper species and observed shifts in their phenology and abundance between 1959â€“1960 and 2006â€“2008 (data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C35">Nufio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C8">Buckley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013b</xref>)<sup>a</sup>Low abundance during initial time period prevents comparison.We examined variation in thermal performance curves among populations and species across five sites along the following elevation gradient: Red Fox (1574â€…m, 40.05N, 105.19W), A1 (2195â€…m, 40.01N, 105.37W), B1 (2591â€…m, 40.02N, 105.43W), C1 (3048â€…m, 40.03N, 105.55W) and D1 (3739â€…m, 40.06N, 105.62W; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C1">Alexander and Hilliard, 1969</xref>; descriptions can be found at <uri xlink:href="http://niwot.colorado.edu/site_info/site_info.html" xlink:type="simple">http://niwot.colorado.edu/site_info/site_info.html</uri>). The sites are grassy clearings associated with upper prairie, foothill, montane, subalpine and alpine life zones, respectively. Adults from populations at each site were kept separately with access to organic romaine lettuce and wheat bran and acclimated overnight in an incubator to an â€˜intermediateâ€™ temperature of 25Â°C. Individuals were then transferred to polyurethane containers for assessment of their hopping performance and feeding rate. When not undergoing tests they were maintained in the same conditions described above.In order to examine how plasticity influences the temperature dependence of performance, we repeated the performance assessments for <italic>M. sanguinipes</italic> reared at constant 24 or 27Â°C and a 14â€…hâ€“10â€…h lightâ€“dark cycle in Percival I-36VL incubators. We reared the other species and, additionally, <italic>M. sanguinipes</italic> at 18 and 30Â°C, but low hatching, development or survival rates prevented analysis. Eggs were collected the previous summer by allowing females to oviposit in damp sand and then sieving the sand to collect the egg pods. Egg pods were then placed in damp vermiculite within condiment containers. The surface was periodically coated with 0.25% methyl-<italic>p</italic>-hydroxy benzoate to inhibit fungal or microbial growth. The eggs were allowed to develop for 3â€…weeks at 25â€“30Â°C and were then stored at 2Â°C for âˆ¼110â€…days to enable diapause. The egg containers were subsequently placed in a 24 or 27Â°C incubator. Upon hatching, the egg containers were placed within rectangular 2.25â€…l polyurethane containers, and romaine lettuce and wheat bran were provided. The grasshoppers were reared together until they reached third instar. Subsequently, grasshoppers were reared individually in 0.47â€…l polyurethane containers, which were changed every other day and supplied with romaine lettuce and wheat bran. Adults were acclimated to 25Â°C before commencing the performance assessments.Grasshoppers were fasted prior to each feeding trial for 12â€…h, a sufficient period to complete digestion and absorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C18">Harrison and Fewell, 1995</xref>), and provided with a damp paper towel for humidity. The feeding trials were conducted at six temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40Â°C; temperature range after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C18">Harrison and Fewell, 1995</xref>). Trials at two temperatures were run concurrently each day, with individuals from each population randomly partitioned between the two temperatures. We assessed performance for an average of 20 individuals from each population (range 14â€“22). The order of temperature trials was randomized. Grasshoppers were acclimated to the test temperature for 1â€…h prior to being provided with organic, baby romaine leaves at the start of two consecutive feeding periods each day. The first feeding period lasted for 2â€…h (reflecting rates of ingestion and of crop and mid-gut filling) and the later feeding period lasted an additional 6â€…h (reflecting rates of ingestion, crop filling and gut throughput; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C18">Harrison and Fewell, 1995</xref>). The initial feeding trials commenced between 07.00 and 09.00â€…h. We used a flatbed scanner (Canon LiDE 100) to photograph the leaves before and after each of the feeding trials. We estimated leaf areas using ImageJ software (<uri xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/" xlink:type="simple">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/</uri>).In order to assess the temperature dependence of hopping performance, grasshoppers were acclimated for 1â€…h at one of four possible temperatures (10, 17, 25 or 35Â°C). Grasshoppers were then removed individually from the incubators and immediately placed in the centre of the experimental arena at room temperature. The arena consisted of a 1.8â€…mâ€…Ã—â€…1.8â€…m sheet of fabric with a checkered pattern at an interval of 2.5â€…cm (methods follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C19">Harrison <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>). Hopping was induced by manual prodding if necessary. We marked the position of the grasshopper after each of five jumps and subsequently recorded the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> locations to an <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> resolution of 2.5â€…cm. We used the means of the five jumps for analysis, but checked that results were similar when using the median. Each individual was tested at each of the four temperatures, with the order of temperatures randomized. Performance of <italic>C. pellucida</italic> was observed to be minimal at the lowest temperature (10Â°C) and was thus not assessed.For reared <italic>M. sanguinipes</italic> individuals, we measured both CT<sub>min</sub> and CT<sub>max</sub>, which were defined as the lower and upper temperatures at which the grasshoppers were no longer able to right themselves. Grasshoppers were placed individually into 50â€…ml centrifuge tubes, which were slowly (âˆ¼0.2Â°Câ€…min<sup>âˆ’1</sup>) cooled or heated in a water bath. Given that warming rates may influence estimates of critical thermal limits, we chose an intermediate rate of warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C12">Chown <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). To minimize stress, we first cooled body temperatures and then began heating body temperatures after an hour.We used maximum likelihood to fit linear mixed-effects models describing feeding and hopping rates as a function of species, elevation, temperature and their interaction (function lme in R). We accounted for repeated measures of individuals by including an individual identifier as a random variable. For the reared grasshoppers, we additionally included a clutch identification as a random variable in which the individual identification was nested. We subsequently dropped the clutch identification as a random effect because its inclusion did not influence our results qualitatively.We assumed that the <italic>T</italic><sub>o</sub> was within 3Â°C of each species' preferred body temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C8">Buckley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013b</xref>) because the upper portion of the performance curve was poorly characterized by our data, particularly for <italic>C. pellucida</italic>. Additionally, we accounted for the minimal performance of <italic>C. pellucida</italic> at 10Â°C by including data points corresponding to zero performance at the CT<sub>min</sub> (species meanâ€…Â±â€…SDâ€…=â€…9.33â€…Â±â€…1.05Â°C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C8">Buckley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013b</xref>). The number of these data points was set at a quarter of the number of individuals included in the performance assay to avoid unduly influencing the TPC fit. Temperature values (<italic>x</italic>-axis) were drawn from a normal distribution based on the mean and standard deviation of CT<sub>min</sub> for each population of <italic>C. pellucida</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C8">Buckley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013b</xref>).We estimated performance shifts over the past 50â€…years at our study sites based on predictions of grasshopper body temperature. We used a steady-state budget of energy flux to describe the flow of energy between grasshoppers and their environments and predict operative body temperature, <italic>T</italic><sub>e</sub>, as follows: <italic>Q</italic><sub>s</sub>â€…<italic>â€‰=â€‰</italic>â€…<italic>Q</italic><sub>t</sub>â€…<italic>â€‰+â€‰</italic>â€…<italic>Q</italic><sub>c</sub>â€…<italic>â€‰+â€‰</italic>â€…<italic>Q</italic><sub>cond</sub>. Here <italic>Q</italic><sub>s</sub> is the total input of heat flux due to solar radiation; <italic>Q</italic><sub>t</sub> describes the flux of thermal radiative heat due to both incoming thermal radiation (ground and sky) and that emitted by the grasshopper; <italic>Q</italic><sub>c</sub> is the heat flux between the grasshopper and the surrounding fluid (air) via convection; and <italic>Q</italic><sub>cond</sub> is the heat flux between the grasshopper's body and the solid surfaces with which the grasshopper's body is in contact via conduction. We used this energy flux model to solve for <italic>T</italic><sub>e</sub>, because rates of thermal radiative heat flux, convection and conduction are functions of <italic>T</italic><sub>e</sub>. We omitted evaporative heat loss because it is negligible for grasshoppers in most conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C3">Anderson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1979</xref>). The detailed description and validation of our biophysical model for grasshoppers is given elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C3">Anderson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C8">Buckley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013b</xref>). We assumed the mean body size among our species to be 21â€…mm. Preliminary analysis of body size trends over time suggest that any body size shifts have been modest. We also assumed that the absorptivity of the grasshopper's body is 0.7 and the albedo of the substrate is 0.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C27">Kingsolver, 1983</xref>). These parameters determine the rate of energy exchange between the grasshopper and its environment.Many insects, including grasshoppers, use thermoregulatory behaviours to buffer environmental variation along altitudinal gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C9">Chappell and Whitman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C41">Samietz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). We bracketed the range of potential body temperatures by assuming that grasshoppers can move between full sun and full shade (no direct radiation). We also assumed that the grasshoppers can move between the ground (25% contact of surface area) and vegetation (0% contact of surface area). This assumption determines rates of conduction between the ground and the grasshopper. We assumed that individuals of each species thermoregulate to the available body temperature closest to the species' preferred body temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C8">Buckley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013b</xref>). We examined sensitivity to the assumptiuon of thermoregulation by additionally considering grasshoppers in vegetation (no conduction with the ground) that are unable to thermoregulate.We parameterized the biophysical model with daily maximum and minimum temperature data from weather stations at our study sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C33">McGuire <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). We estimated hourly air temperatures (<italic>T</italic><sub>a</sub>) using a diurnal temperature variation function based on maximum and minimum temperatures and the Julian date as modelled by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C39">Parton and Logan (1981)</xref>. Daytime temperatures were fitted using a sine wave, while night-time temperatures were modelled using an exponential function.

Thermal tolerances did not differ significantly between populations from different elevations. The CT<sub>min</sub> (8.49â€…Â±â€…0.35Â°C) and CT<sub>max</sub> (57.52â€…Â±â€…0.31Â°C) of field-collected <italic>M. sanguinipes</italic> were intermediate between the values for the laboratory-reared grasshoppers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C8">Buckley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013b</xref>).Our analyses suggest that performance metrics offer greater promise for understanding differential responses to climate change than cruder thermal tolerance metrics. Our focal grasshoppers have extremely high CT<sub>max</sub> (&gt;57Â°C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C8">Buckley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013b</xref>), presumably due to the need to tolerate high body temperatures associated with radiation spikes at altitude. We did not detect upper thermal limits for feeding performance and did not fully assess those for hopping performance, but our data suggest that upper limits occur at temperatures substantially below CT<sub>max</sub>. We previously found only limited differences in critical thermal tolerances and preferred body temperatures between the grasshopper species and populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C8">Buckley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013b</xref>). These previously observed differences were insufficient to account for differential responses to recent climate change. Although CT<sub>min</sub> and CT<sub>max</sub> reflect thermal limits for activity as measured in the laboratory, the thermal range for activity tends to be more thermally restricted in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C22">Huey, 1982</xref>). The CT<sub>max</sub> reflects the ability to withstand thermal extremes and is more closely predicted by temperature variation than mean temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C13">Clusella-Trullas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The CT<sub>min</sub> reflects both thermal means and extremes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C13">Clusella-Trullas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Another limitation is that estimates of critical thermal limits are sensitive to methology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C12">Chown <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The relevance of thermal tolerances to climate-change responses is dependent on whether individual fitness and population dynamics tend to be more limited by acute thermal stress or by chronic energetic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C22">Huey, 1982</xref>). The limiting mechansism is related to the distance between limits on activity and lethal limits and how this distance compares with environmental variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C45">Woodin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Thermal tolerances are likely to be better predictors for populations near latitudinal and elevational range limits, where individuals may be more likely to encounter stressful temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C5">Bozinovic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).We find that grasshoppers are adapted to feed at warm temperatures even in cool, alpine environments. This is consistent with grasshoppers being effective thermoregulators, able to achieve high body temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C18">Harrison and Fewell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C32">Lactin and Johnson, 1995</xref>) even at altitude. Using field-collected individuals, we found similar temperature dependence for food processing (8â€…h measurements) and consumption (2â€…h measurements). Temperature sensitivities (<italic>Q</italic><sub>10</sub>) were greater for <italic>C. pelludica</italic> and <italic>M. sanguinipes</italic> (0.8â€“1.1) than for the cool-adapted <italic>M. boulderensis</italic> (âˆ¼0.4). In contrast to our results, food processing was found to be more temperature sensitive (<italic>Q</italic><sub>10</sub>) than chewing and crop filling rates for a low-elevation population of another Colorado grasshopper species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C18">Harrison and Fewell, 1995</xref>).Grasshopper hopping performance, which corresponds to the ability to locomote for foraging and escape from predators, does not exhibit the same warm adaptation as feeding. These thermal constraints differ from those on vertebrate ectotherms, whose TPCs for assimilation tend to be narrower than those for locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C4">Angilletta, 2009</xref>). Due to the broader TPCs for assimilation than those for locomotion for grasshoppers, we estimate that recent climate change has driven declines in hopping performance but an increased capacity for feeding for species other than the warm-adapted <italic>C. pellucida</italic> at most sites. We expect that grasshoppers will face restrictions in activity time available for foraging, but that they will readily be able to consume and assimilate the vegetation obtained. What will these counteracting shifts mean for energetics and population dynamics? Integrating their effects is challenging because grasshoppers are likely to partition these activities temporally; they may forage during the cool mornings and then rapidly digest food during warm afternoons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C18">Harrison and Fewell, 1995</xref>).Do our expectations for performance shifts align with observed abundance changes in the sites between 1959â€“1960 and 2006â€“2008? Abundance has declined for the three focal species at the lower elevation sites. At the highest elevation site, <italic>C. pellucida</italic> abundance has increased and <italic>M. boulderensis</italic> abundance has remained approximately constant since initial surveys. <italic>Melanoplus sanguinipes</italic> was absent or at low abundance at the highest elevation site during the initial surveys (Fig. S1 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C8">Buckley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013b</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COU035TB1">1</xref>). We estimate hopping performance increases concentrated at high elevation for the warm-adapted <italic>C. pellucida</italic> since the initial surveys. We estimate that <italic>M. boulderensis</italic> experienced hopping performance declines at the lower elevation sites and no change in hopping performance but increased feeding performance at the high-elevation site. We estimate performance declines at lower elevations but a weak increase at the high-elevation site for <italic>M. sanuinipes</italic>. These estimates roughly correspond to the observed abundance shifts in response to recent climate change.Our findings highlight the potential importance of plasticity to responses to climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C11">Chevin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). The greater plasticity of hopping relative to feeding may result from all populations and species being selected to take advantage of the warm temperatures available across elevations by basking in sunny areas for feeding and assimilation. However, we find that the assimilation rates of high-elevation populations increase with temperature more strongly at the lower rearing temperature. This suggests the importance of taking advantage of high temperatures for assimilation when they are available in cold environments. The greater plasticity of assimilation compared with consumption may stem from differences in the potential for enzymatic alterations. Likewise, rearing at warmer temperatures increases hopping performance at high temperatures, providing additional evidence that organisms take advantage of warm temperatures. This plasticity is consistent with a hotter-is-better dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C4">Angilletta, 2009</xref>).The observed plasticity in hopping performance may mitigate some of the performance declines predicted to result from climate change. Indeed, plasticity has played a substantial role in recent responses, with most evidence coming from changes in body size resulting from shifts in growing season and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C37">Ozgul <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C38">2010</xref>) and changes in breeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C40">RÃ©ale <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C10">Charmantier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) and flowering phenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C2">Anderson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Plasticity will both enable rapid responses to climate change and buffer the selection potentially required to cope with climate change in the long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C11">Chevin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Plasticity can substantially enhance the rate of climate change that organisms can pace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C17">Gienapp <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).While less is known about how thermal acclimatization has contributed to recent responses to climate change, thermal acclimatization in response to extreme temperaturesâ€”such as cold hardeningâ€”is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C43">Sinclair <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C4">Angilletta, 2009</xref>). Both short-term reversible acclimatization and developmental acclimatization will be likely to be important to responses to climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C4">Angilletta, 2009</xref>). Less is known about the potential for developmental acclimatization because few laboratory studies have examined development and fitness in realistically variable environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU035C30">Kingsolver <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Further examination of developmental plasticity in variable environments would refine our understanding of how plasticity may alleviate performance declines resulting from climate change.<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/conphys/cou035/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary material is available at <italic>Conservation Physiology</italic> online.</ext-link>We thank Deane Bowers for use of her laboratory; Rick Levy and Kimberly Lewis for assistance with collecting the eggs used in rearing; Evan Kirk, Ethan Miller, Parth Shah, Austin Brandt, Heidi MacLean and Kate Augustine for assistance with rearing and measuring leaf areas; and members of the Buckley and Kingsolver research groups for helpful comments.
