These different components of biodiversity are described and compared to answer the following questions:Does habitat heterogeneity affect nematode community composition on a local scale?How differ the biodiversity patterns of the nematode communities from control samples compared to those from sponge samples?Do the three different approaches (abundance-based, taxonomic, functional measures) provide different interpretable information on the nematode's biodiversity patterns?Bathymetric map of the HAUSGARTEN area with 16 permanent sampling sites (red dots). The star marks the sampling position of this study at 2300 m water depth.(a.) Positions of the control cores (HG3, HG5, and HG7, open circles), and sponge cores (HG2, HG4, and HG6, closed circles). (b) Sub-sampling scheme of the sponge cores. Sub-sampling of the control cores corresponds to the sub-sampling scheme of the sponge cores.In order to allow sub-sampling at various positions around the sponges it was necessary to localise the sponges exactly in the centre of the push-cores. A precise positioning of the push-cores with the manipulator arm of the ROV was not always possible; therefore three sub-samples from the sponge cores are missing (one of each sponge core).To measure and compare biodiversity patterns of the nematodes, taxonomic composition and functional traits of the nematode species, indicated by functional groups are described as complements to diversity as number of species and their relative abundance. For the calculation of the different diversity measures of the nematode community only the uppermost sediment layers of the sub-samples from control and sponge cores were taken into account.To estimate functional diversity of the nematode communities, organisms were divided into life-form types by means of the structure of buccal cavity, tail shape and body shape. These characteristics are linked to feeding strategy, locomotion mode, and mobility of the nematodes. These connectable criteria are considered as morphological adaptation to a given life-style.1. Feeding types according to Wieser (1953) based on buccal cavity structure.2. Tail-shape groups (Iâ€“V) based on variety of tail shapes.The diversity measures for functional diversity were analysed using a randomised complete block analysis, with factors block â€œsampling siteâ€ (randomly chosen) and treatment â€œsponge/control coreâ€. The response variable was diversity per core. The null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) was that there are no differences in diversity between sponge and control samples per core, pooling across all possible blocks.S: number of species, J': Pielou's index of evenness, ES<sub>(100)</sub>: expected number of species/100 individuals, H'<sub>(log2)</sub>: Shannon-Wiener diversity index.lâ€Š=â€Šlower than expected; expâ€Š=â€Šas expected; hâ€Š=â€Šhigher than expected.Comparing functional diversity (FGR<sub>(100)</sub>) and Shannon-Wiener diversity H'(log<sub>2</sub>) between sponge and control core of each core pair, values for the sponge core were equal to or higher than for the corresponding control core. Functional evenness (J') showed no clear trend. Control and sponge core of the pair HG4/HG5 showed the same values for evenness, whereas evenness of the remaining two core pairs was in one instance higher for the sponge core (HG2) and in one instance higher for the control core (HG7). CV-values of the sponge cores were always higher than for the controls.(a) control and (b) sponge samples (sediment-depth 0â€“1 cm). R<sup>2</sup> for a linear relationship.

However, in the deep sea benthic sampling is more costly, and time consuming, and technically more difficult than to obtain samples from shallower waters. Replicate or multipoint sampling over a small area, although statistically desirable, is therefore only rarely accomplished. Despite the above mentioned difficulties in sampling the deep sea and as a result of the targeted sampling that could only be achieved by using a ROV, we were able to obtain a sufficient set of samples which allows an accurate resolution of the nematode community patterns.The diversity patterns of the nematode communities suggest that the abundance-occupancy relationship (relationship between density of individuals and distribution of nematode species) is related to the different environmental conditions and to the effects of different interspecific interactions in control sediments and around the sponges.Although abundance-based diversity measures can easily be criticised on the grounds that they do not account for phylogenetic, taxonomic, and functional variability among species and are heavily dependent on sample size/effort, they are simple and intuitively sensible measures of species diversity.Our comparison of sponge associated nematode assemblages with those from adjacent control sediments revealed that sub-samples from controls as well as from sponge cores tended to show low to expected values for taxonomic distinctness (AvTD). However, the control samples predominantly showed low values for taxonomic variance (VarTD), whereas sub-samples from sponge cores showed higher than expected variance values.Obviously, coexistence of taxonomically similar species is promoted in the control cores, whereas more dissimilar species coexist in the sponge cores. More heterogeneous habitat conditions of the sediments around the sponges might operate as a force that interrupts the process of competitive exclusion and thus causes higher taxonomic variability and species richness of the sponge cores. Restricted available resources would have a stronger limiting effect on the control than on the sponge-associated communities and would cause a nematode community with reduced species richness in connection with a lower taxonomic variability.Coexistence of the species within the sponge cores mainly depends on the response of the species to the heterogeneous environment. Thus the interactions between the species might be conditioned by the extent of ecological requirements overlap (or not overlap) along the relevant environmental parameters. This could lead to a negative correlation of taxonomic similarity and local coexistence within the sponge cores. The biogenic structure â€œspongeâ€ creates a heterogeneous environment on a local scale compared to the regional level. On local scale, (taxonomically) similar competitors (low or rather expected AvTD-values) are being affected differently by the heterogeneous environment within the sponge cores, which is expressed by a more variable distribution of the nematode species across the genera (increased VarTD-values).Diversity values for the functional structure of the nematode community only show differences at a 10% level between the communities of the control and sponge cores. Together with the higher CV values for the sponge communities, this might nevertheless be an indication not only for a higher functional diversity, but also for a higher functional divergence within the sponge-associated nematode community. Higher functional divergence induces a higher degree of niche partitioning and therewith a lower degree of resource competition. There is a high probability that a more efficient resource utilisation could cause a higher ecological community function within the sponge cores.The relationship between species richness and functional diversity differs in the nematode communities from control and sponge samples. This relationship is linear within the control sediments: the higher the species richness, the greater the functional diversity (as number of functional groups). In contrast, the correlation between number of species and number of functional groups appears to be weaker with a lower slope within the community from sponge samples. This could be an indication that under homogeneous environmental conditions functional niches of the species do not overlap or rather less strong (control cores) than under heterogeneous environmental conditions, where niches of the species seem to overlap more broadly (sponge cores). These differences imply that for the community function of the sponge cores the species identity effect is less important than the functional identity of the species compared to control cores. The functional habitat structure of the sponge-associated sediments seems to favour a community in which diversity was not so much determined by the number of species but by the coexistence of individual species as well as their interactions. Increasing species richness was becoming possible due to a stronger differentiation of the available niche space. By contrast in the control cores an increase of species richness depends on the variety of ecological niches and was, therefore, related to an increasing functional diversity.Compared to the sponge-associated nematode community, the community of the controls is defined by a lower number of functional groups and number of species within the functional groups along with a lower rate of species, whose certain individuals occur in more than one functional group. This is an indication that under the more homogeneous environment of the control sediments less (functional) niche space is available. The functional niches are narrower but more different, and there is less empty niche space. This could mean that less interaction takes place between the species of the control cores.By contrast, overall more functional groups occur within the sponge cores. The particular functional groups contain more species and the portion of species, whose individuals occur in more than one functional group, is higher in the sponge cores compared to the control cores. This is a further indication that the heterogeneous environmental conditions in the sponge-associated sediments are quite likely to provide a larger functional niche space and niche overlapping is thus stronger than in the control cores.Results for functional diversity showed a higher level of ecological function within the nematode community from the sponge cores (higher functional diversity and more interaction between the species) compared to control cores. As long as the degree of environmental heterogeneity does not reach a point where the individuals of different species no longer interact, these mechanisms cause a certain redundancy within the functional groups.A combination of multiple disequilibrium processes and mechanisms, interacting in complex ways, affects the nematode community structure in different ways in control and sponge-associated sediments. Under the rather homogeneous environmental conditions of the control sediments species diversity is associated with an increase of ecological different groups. However, the number of species and the functional richness is lower than under comparably heterogeneous environmental conditions of sponge-associated sediments.Comparing the different approaches to describe diversity, we demonstrated that at least for local scale studies the traditional species-level approach alone is less conclusive. Although our examination of the nematode communities from control and sponge-associated sediments is only a snapshot, our findings show that more emphasis should be placed on the various aspects of diversity (e.g. as physiological, morphological, behavior related and other traits which are represented by the species of a community), to evaluate the effects of diversity on community or ecosystem functioning and to identify the underlying mechanisms and processes on a spatial (and temporal) scale.Nematode genera and families identified in control and sponge samples (mean values including standard deviation, 0â€“5 cm sediment depth) and their functional classification.(DOC)We thank the operational team of the Remotely Operated Vehicle â€˜Victor 6000â€™ (IFREMER/GENAVIR) and the crew of RV â€˜L'Atalanteâ€™ for their helpful support during the expedition.
