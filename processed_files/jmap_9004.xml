Groundwater fluctuations induced by ecological water conveyance in the lower Tarim River, Xinjiang, ChinaData from 40 monitoring wells across 9 sections of the lower Tarim River from 2000 to 2006 were analyzed to investigate the relationship between the transmission loss per unit river length and the change in groundwater depth. The relationship between the rise of the groundwater table (y) and the distance from the main river reach (x) was then assessed through regression analysis. We concluded that the maximum affected area was 1933 m away from the main river reach in the Alagan section, and the minimum affected area was 576 m away in the Kaogan section. In addition, after 8 water deliveries, the volume for recharging the groundwater was 78 248.7 × 104 m3. Using the Yingsu section as an example, we found that the volume for recharging the groundwater decreased with additional periods of delivery except after the second and sixth water delivery The results revealed that the beneficial effect of an ecological water conveyance project on the ecosystem in the lower Tarim River is a long-term process. These findings may be useful for guiding studies on instream flow requirements and provide a scientific basis for implementing similar ecological projects in other areas.
