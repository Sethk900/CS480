Reduced leaf diffusive resistance with re-exposure of maize (Zea mays L.) to atrazineApplication and subsequent removal of atrazine in a nutrient solution resulted in changes in leaf diffusive resistance in maize. Re-exposure to atrazine elicited lower responses in leaf diffusive resistance, suggesting an improved tolerance to atrazine by maize. The time elapsed between removal and re-application of atrazine to maize influenced the response of leaf diffusive resistance.
