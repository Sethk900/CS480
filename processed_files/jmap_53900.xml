Mercury content of soils in Western Britain with special reference to contamination from base metal miningMercury was determined in 51 soil samples from historic base metal mining areas of England and Wales, together with cadmium, copper, lead, zinc, pH and organic content. Background mercury was calculated as 0.093 ppm whence 51% of the samples were judged to be contaminated. A very strong statistical correlation between mercury and lead and weaker but significant correlations between mercury and copper and zinc were found. Highest levels of mercury (maximum, 1.78 ppm Hg) and other metals occurred in soils derived from the floodplain of a river which was at one time badly polluted by mine waste. In a profile pit near a lead mine in the west of England both mercury and lead were enriched in surface horizons. It is concluded that land contaminated by heavy metals, especially lead, in the historic metal mining areas of England and Wales is also likely to be contaminated by mercury.
