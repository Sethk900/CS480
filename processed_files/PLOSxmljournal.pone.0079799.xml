No vertebrates were collected in this study; surveys were through visual census only. No â€œtakingâ€ of any flora or fauna was conducted except for samples of seawater. This study was conducted under a research license from Belize Fisheries, which was obtained by the Smithsonian Institution's Caribbean Coral Reef Ecosystems Program.Tube length (cm, mean Â± SE) (A). Growth over a one-year period (cm, mean Â± SE) (B). Common superscripts indicate groups not significantly different from each other.Depth-dependent concentrations of total picoplankton (A). Instantaneous total cells consumed per individual at each depth (B). Instantaneous intake of total particulate carbon per individual (C). Daily intake of total energy (J) per individual (D). Common superscripts indicate groups not significantly different from each other.Notes: Data presented are the mean number of fish Â± SE per 2Ã—10 m band transects (nâ€Š=â€Š5 replicates at each of three depths: 10 m, 30 m and 46 m). Percent of bites on sponges for each fish species are based on 15 min bite count observations of five fish on the shallow- and deep- reefs (na â€Š=â€Š not applicable: no fish observed at depth); the number of sponge species sampled during that period are included in parentheses. The average number of bites per 15 min observation period, and the average number of focal bites on individual sponges are recorded. In all cases where numbers are separated by a hash (â€œ/â€), the first number refers to the shallow depths and the second number refers to the deep depth.We thank Deborah Gochfeld for constructive comments on the manuscript.
