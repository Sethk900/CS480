Effect of soil tillage, crop rotation and nitrogen application rates on soil mineral-N levels in the Swartland wheat producing area of South AfricaStudies on nitrogen (N) levels in soil were conducted from 1997 to 2000 in a long-term tillage and crop rotation trial, which started in 1976. Three tillage methods namely conventional tillage (CT), tine tillage (TT), and notillage (NT) were compared. Crop rotation systems used were continuous wheat (WW) and wheat/lupin/wheat/canola (WLWC). Three rates of N-fertilisers (60, 100 and 140 kg N ha−1) were applied. All treatments received 60 kg N ha−1 at planting, while the 100 and 140 kg N ha−1 treatments received additional top-dressings of 40 kg N ha−1 at tillering and stem elongation stages respectively. Soil samplings were done at 14-day intervals, starting immediately before planting and continued till harvesting each year. Samplings at planting were done before N-fertiliser was applied and therefore regarded as pre-planting (Pp). The effect of tillage methods on mineral-N was variable and inconsistent among the soil samplings and years. During the four-year-period of this study, higher values of total mineral-N were found with conventional tillage at the pre-planting (Pp) samplings. Crop rotation did not significantly influence total mineral-N, which may be explained by the cultivation of a legume crop (lupins) once every four years only. In general the application of N-fertiliser resulted as expected in an initial increase in the mineral-N content of the soil. However, this was soon followed by a rapid decline as crops start to utilise the added nitrogen, resulting in values of less than 10 mg kg−1 soil during the grain filling stages with application rates of 60 and 100 kg N ha−1. These values may be regarded as deficient for grain yields of 4000 to 5000 kg ha−1.
