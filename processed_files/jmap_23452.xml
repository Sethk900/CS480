Typhlonesticus gocmeni sp. n., a new cave-dwelling blind spider species from the Aegean region of Turkey (Araneae, Nesticidae)Abstract A new species of the troglobitic spider genus Typhlonesticus is described from specimens found in KeloÄŸlan Cave (Denizli Province, Dodurgalar Town), Turkey. Typhlonesticus gocmeni sp. n. is described on the basis of both sexes; and its phylogenetic relationships with closely related European genera and species are discussed based on morphological and molecular data (the cox1, rrnL and H3 genes). Three new combinations are proposed: Typhlonesticus idriacus (Roewer, 1931), comb. n., Typhlonesticus morisii (Brignoli, 1975) comb. n. and Typhlonesticus obcaecatus (Simon, 1907), comb. n. all ex Nesticus.
