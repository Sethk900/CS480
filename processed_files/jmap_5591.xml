Hibernation and emergence pattern of Tupinambis merianae (Squamata: Teiidae) in the Taim Ecological Station, southern BrazilThe emergence period and winter aggregations of a population of Tupinambis merianae from southern Brazil as well as some behavioural aspects from its postâ€emergence period are examined. Fiftyâ€six individuals were captured and marked in 64 days (640Â h) of field study. Most of the hibernacula identified were beneath human constructions. The first individuals emerged in August and the last active ones were observed in April. The population's emergence shows a protandric pattern, where males emerge before females, both in adults and juveniles. After emerging, males basked in aggregations of up to 13 individuals, in which individuals changed positions following audible resonant signals emitted by the lizards. Sibilated sounds were emitted in stress situations or in agonistic interactions. Future studies are necessary to elucidate behaviour patterns of the species in the natural environment, mainly related to the utilization of sound communication.
