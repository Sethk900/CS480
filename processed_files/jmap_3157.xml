A pressure-operated drop net for capturing Greater Sage-GrouseA pressure-operated drop net was developed to capture endangered Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) in Alberta, Canada. A drop net was developed because other capture methods, such as night lighting and walk-in traps, have largely been unsuccessful in Alberta, and rocket netting was too dangerous to be used with an endangered population. Nets (one black and one gray) were used to capture 13 birds (12 males and 1 female) in six attempts. Nets dropped quickly (about 1 s) and quietly and captured all birds under the net. More birds (N = 12) were captured using a gray net than a black net, probably because it was less conspicuous. The presence of a drop net on the lek did not alter the behavior of the birds at the lek or influence lek attendance. The cost of a net, including all supplies, tools, and equipment needed, was $790 US ($900 CAN). This pressure-operated drop net system should prove effective for capturing other lekking species and other ground-dwelling birds that will respond to baiting.
