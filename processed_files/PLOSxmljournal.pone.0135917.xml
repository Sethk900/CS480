The diversity of plant species and their distribution in space are both thought to have important effects on the function of wetland ecosystems. However, knowledge of the relationships between plant species and spatial diversity remains incomplete. In this study, we investigated relationships between spatial pattern and plant species diversity over a five year period following the initial restoration of experimental wetland ecosystems. In 2003, six identical and hydrologically-isolated 0.18 ha wetland â€œcellsâ€ were constructed in former farmland in northeast Ohio. The systems were subjected to planting treatments that resulted in different levels of vascular plant species diversity among cells. Plant species diversity was assessed through annual inventories. Plant spatial pattern was assessed by digitizing low-altitude aerial photographs taken at the same time as the inventories. Diversity metrics derived from the inventories were significantly related to certain spatial metrics derived from the photographs, including cover type diversity and contagion. We found that wetlands with high cover type diversity harbor higher plant species diversity than wetlands with fewer types of patches. We also found significant relationships between plant species diversity and spatial patterning of patch types, but the direction of the effect differed depending on the diversity metric used. Links between diversity and spatial pattern observed in this study suggest that high-resolution aerial imagery may provide wetland scientists with a useful tool for assessing plant diversity.  Our goal in this study was to quantify relationships between species diversity and spatial heterogeneity of wetland plants under controlled conditions. Over a five year period following planting, we assessed spatial patterning of vegetation and plant species diversity in six constructed wetland ecosystems that had been managed to achieve different levels of diversity. We expected that measures of plant species diversity in individual wetlands would be related to measures of spatial diversity, such as cover type diversity and aggregation.  â€œHigh-intensityâ€ cells 2 and 5 were subjected to repeated plantings starting in 2003. â€œLow-intensityâ€ cells 3 and 6 received initial planting and replanting the subsequent year. Cells 1 and 4 were unplanted. Cells 2, 3, and 4 were fertilized in 2010 and 2011.  Permanent rebar posts marked the edges of 10 x 10 m quadrats in each cell. Quadrats in which the annual species surveys were conducted are delineated in grey and identified with odd numbers. Analyses were conducted at the level of whole cells and by zone. The â€œcentralâ€ zone (quadrats inside the dotted line) has no adjacency to upland regions (quadrats 5, 8, 11, and 14). The â€œedgeâ€ zone contains or is bordered by upland terrain outside of the cell (all remaining quadrats). The â€œdeepâ€ zone encompasses regions containing deeper water (quadrats 1â€“12), while the â€œshallowâ€ zone is comprised of regions that were seasonally dry (quadrats 13â€“18).  Species planted originally as vegetative propagules were replanted in high-intensity cells in 2004, 2005, and 2006.  This example is of cell 3, a high-intensity planted cell, from a photograph taken in 2010.  SHDI is a combined measure of cover type richness and evenness in a landscape. Higher values indicate higher diversity and more even distribution of cover types, while lower values indicate lower diversity and less even distribution. SHDI considers the proportion of a landscape occupied by patches of different cover types, but not the spatial configuration of those patches within the landscape. It is thus very similar to the standard ground-based Shannon-Wiener index used to quantify species diversity, but quantifies diversity based on the smaller number of cover types identified through aerial photography and on total area occupied rather than percent cover within an area. In this study, SHDI was calculated based on the 11 cover types distinguished from aerial photographs, versus the 98 distinct species identified in our species diversity inventories.  SHAPE_AM is a metric that measures the mean complexity of patch shape within a landscape. To accomplish this, the actual shape of each patch is compared to a standard (square) shape of the same area, and SHAPE_AM quantifies the degree to which its edge-to-area ratio differs. An advantage of using SHAPE_AM over other similar metrics like perimeter-to-area ratio is that it is standardized to be independent of patch size.
