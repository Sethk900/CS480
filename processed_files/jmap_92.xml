Management of Microstegium vimineum Invasions and Recovery of Resident Plant Communities.Restoration of communities invaded by exotic plants requires effective eradication of the invader and reestablishment of the resident plant community. Despite the commonly cited need for techniques to accomplish such goals, studies that test strategies for removing invasive plants, monitor effects on resident communities, and incorporate replicate sites are generally lacking. <em>Microstegium vimineum</em> is an exotic annual grass that is rapidly invading forests in the eastern United States and threatening to reduce biodiversity and inhibit forest regeneration. I conducted a field experiment at eight sites over two growing seasons in southern Indiana to evaluate hand-weeding (HW), a postemergent grass-specific herbicide (POST), and the postemergent herbicide plus a preemergent herbicide (POST + PRE) for removing <em>Microstegium</em>. Compared to reference plots (REF), the three treatments each reduced <em>Microstegium</em> biomass at the end of the growing seasons to relatively low levels. However, after the second year of the experiment, POST and POST + PRE resulted in very little spring cover of <em>Microstegium</em>, but HW plots were significantly reinvaded. HW and POST, but not POST + PRE, increased resident plant community productivity and spring resident community cover compared to reference plots. The amount of light at the research sites did not alter the effectiveness of treatments, but the recovery of resident communities was positively correlated with light availability under HW and POST + PRE. These results indicate that natural systems invaded by <em>Microstegium</em> can be restored using the POST or HW treatments, which will effectively remove the invasion and allow the resident plant community to recover when used over multiple growing seasons.
