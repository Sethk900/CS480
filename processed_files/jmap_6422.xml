Spatial pattern and variability of soil and hillslope properties in a granitic landscape 2. Pretoriaâ€”Johannesburg areaUsing a transect design, a detailed examination was made of nine hillslopes and 64 soil profiles in the granitic area between Johannesburg and Pretoria to assess the spatial pattern and variability of soil and hillslope properties. The land surface was found to be fairly homogeneous with the soils strongly site-related and occurring as a catena. Consequently, it was possible to use a single model to depict the main soil-hillslope features of the area. Evidence of the relatively ancient character and complex history of the landscape was found in the form of paleo soil features, stonelines and African erosion surface relics.
