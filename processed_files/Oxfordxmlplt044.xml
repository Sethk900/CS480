Photoautotrophic micropropagation is an effective means of increasing the biomass of <italic>Oncidesa</italic> orchids. Using 10,000 µmol mol<sup>−1</sup> CO<sub>2</sub> and a photosynthetic photon flux density of 60 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, the number of leaves and roots and shoot and root fresh and dry weights could be considerably increased, but only when cultured on Kyoto medium rather than Vacin and Went medium. Super-elevated CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment and growth under cold cathode fluorescent lamps can positively affect the efficiency and quality of commercial production of clonal <italic>Oncidesa</italic> plantlets.As interest in how to increase biomass production through biotechnological means gains traction, focus is turning towards the use of photoautotrophic micropropagation under elevated levels of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) to maximize plant growth and productivity. The effect of super-elevated CO<sub>2</sub> with cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) on the photoautotrophic growth of <italic>Oncidesa in vitro</italic> has been studied using a gas-permeable film culture vessel, the ‘Vitron’. The growth of <italic>Oncidesa</italic> (formerly <italic>Oncidesa</italic> Gower Ramsey ‘U-1’) plantlets on Vacin and Went (VW) medium was stimulated by 10 000 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup> CO<sub>2</sub>. In particular, increasing the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) from 45 to 60 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> under 10 000 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup> CO<sub>2</sub> in the growth chamber remarkably increased the number of leaves and roots, and shoot and root fresh and dry weights compared with plantlets under the same level of CO<sub>2</sub> under low PPFD (45 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>). However, there was a remarkable decrease in photosynthetic capacity, and chlorosis and browning of leaves. In stark contrast, plantlets grown on Kyoto medium at 10 000 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup> CO<sub>2</sub> under high PPFD had a higher photosynthetic rate than plantlets grown on VW medium, and no chlorosis or browning was observed. Furthermore, shoot growth was remarkably enhanced. Therefore, super-elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (10 000 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup>) enrichment and growth under CCFLs can positively affect the efficiency and quality of commercial production of clonal <italic>Oncidesa</italic> plantlets.The use of plant tissue culture as a way to increase plant biomass in a short span of time is an attractive application of biotechnology practised by many plant scientists. The ability to induce greater biomass by increasing the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentration through photoautotrophic micropropagation—which has proven benefits in terms of productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C20">Kozai <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>)—has wide practical applications for ornamental and other horticultural crops.<italic>Oncidium</italic> is an epiphytic and terrestrial orchid. This genus comprises about 400 species distributed mainly in tropical and subtropical South and Central America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C8">Endress 1996</xref>). Many hybrid <italic>Oncidium</italic> have been produced, the most attractive having become commercially important as potted plants and cut flowers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C10">Fast (1973)</xref> first reported that <italic>Oncidium</italic> plantlets could be induced by shoot tips, and several effective protocols for clonal propagation have been developed since then (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C1">Arditti 2008</xref>) and are now used for commercial micropropagation. However, relatively high production costs continue to hamper the expansion of hybrid <italic>Oncidium</italic> production since it may take almost one year for plantlets to reach the acclimatization stage. Since orchids such as <italic>Oncidium</italic> are inherently slow growers, there are considerable energy costs spent on controlling air temperature and lighting in the culture room. To overcome these limitations, despite several studies existing on efficient multiplication and regeneration of <italic>Oncidium</italic> plantlets (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C2">Chen and Chang 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C3">Chen <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C19">Jheng <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>), it is also important to enhance the growth of plantlets regenerated <italic>in vitro</italic>.Over two decades, many studies have been conducted on photoautotrophic culture in various species, including <italic>Oncidium</italic> hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C14">He <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>), which has several advantages over photomixotrophic culture: promotion of growth and photosynthesis, high survival percentage <italic>ex vitro</italic>, elimination of physiological and morphological disorders, and less microbial contamination (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C45">Xiao <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Under photoautotrophic culture, CO<sub>2</sub> is one of the most important factors directly affecting the growth and photosynthesis of plantlets because they should produce complex organic compounds from CO<sub>2</sub> as a carbon source using energy from light. Therefore, it is necessary for enhancing photoautotrophic growth to provide a sufficient optimal concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C35">Tanaka (1991)</xref> developed several film culture vessels that had high gas and light permeability. The photoautotrophic growth of several orchid plantlets was stimulated using 3000 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup> CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment: C<sub>3</sub> <italic>Cymbidium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C33">Tanaka <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C37">Teixeira da Silva <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>), C<sub>3</sub> <italic>Epidendrum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C11">Giang and Tanaka 2004</xref>), CAM <italic>Phalaenopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C34">Tanaka <italic>et al.</italic> 1993</xref>) and C<sub>3</sub> <italic>Oncidium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C14">He <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>). It was previously demonstrated in CAM <italic>Phalaenopsis</italic> that an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration from 3000 to 5000 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup> remarkably enhanced the photoautotrophic growth of plantlets in film culture vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C25">Norikane and Tanaka 2010</xref>), implying that higher CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment (&gt;3000 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup>) could have a positive effect on the photoautotrophic growth of orchid plantlets.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C15">Hew <italic>et al.</italic> (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C12">Gouk <italic>et al.</italic> (1997)</xref> conducted detailed plant physiological studies on the effect of super-elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels (10 000 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup>) on the <italic>in vitro</italic> growth of CAM orchids Mokara White and Mokara Yellow, concluding that these levels were able to stimulate the growth of plantlets on sugar-added medium (i.e. photomixotrophic conditions). A similar trend was noticed for the <italic>Cymbidium</italic> hybrid but at a lower CO<sub>2</sub> level (3000 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C37">Teixeira da Silva <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). In the photoautotrophic culture of <italic>Cymbidium</italic>, 10 000 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup> CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment remarkably enhanced the growth of plantlets in a conventional glass bottle with a TPX cap having a hole covered with a gas-permeable membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C24">Norikane <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). However, beyond these studies, little is known about the effect of super-elevated CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment on the photoautotrophic growth of orchid plantlets (or any other crop for that matter) in film culture vessels. Thus, one key objective of our study was to ascertain whether super-elevated CO<sub>2</sub> would have further positive effects on the photoautotrophic growth of <italic>Oncidesa</italic> plantlets in film culture vessels.Light is also an essential factor for plant growth and development. Recently, the use of cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) as a radiation source for plants has been attempted because of their attractive features, including their small diameter (1.6–3.0 mm), long life (50 000 h) and low heat generation, with an estimated 40 % reduction in electric energy consumption used for lighting and air conditioners during micropropagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C31">Tanaka <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C25">Norikane and Tanaka 2010</xref>). Those studies demonstrated that <italic>Cymbidium</italic> and <italic>Phalaenopsis in vitro</italic> plantlets cultured under CCFLs showed enhanced photoautotrophic growth compared with plantlets cultured under conventional heat fluorescent lamps. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C6">Ding <italic>et al.</italic> (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C42">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> (2011)</xref> also reported the usefulness of CCFLs as a lighting source for the micropropagation of tree peony and <italic>Gerbera</italic>. Our present study is the first report on the use of CCFLs as a radiation source for <italic>Oncidesa</italic> plantlet growth <italic>in vitro</italic>.The aim of the present study was to achieve more efficient and higher-quality commercial clonal orchid plantlets, in this case, an <italic>Oncidium</italic> hybrid (<italic>Oncidesa</italic>), by super-elevated CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment under CCFLs on two different media.The explants used in this study were shoots with 2–3 leaves obtained from a mass of protocorm-like bodies of <italic>Oncidesa</italic> (formerly <italic>Oncidesa</italic> Gower Ramsey ‘U-1’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C26">Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) 2013</xref>) derived from shoot-tip culture. This is a sympodial orchid hybrid, thin-leaved and with a C<sub>3</sub> mode of photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C17">Hew and Yong 1997</xref>). Twenty-five shoots were cultured in each culture vessel for 3 months, and two culture vessels were used for each treatment.Vacin and Went (VW) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C41">Vacin and Went 1949</xref>) sugar-free liquid medium was used as the basal medium. To examine the effect of basal medium under super-elevated CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment, Kyoto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C40">Tsukamoto <italic>et al.</italic> 1963</xref>) sugar-free liquid medium was also used. VW and Kyoto media are two of the most commonly used media in orchid biotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C38">Teixeira da Silva <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). The pH of the media was adjusted to 5.3 with 1 N NaOH or HCl before autoclaving at 121 °C for 17 min.The film culture vessel ‘Vitron’ (122 mm × 122 mm × 140 mm) consists of a three-dimensional injection-moulded polypropylene frame covered by a heat-sealed OTP film (Otsuka Techno Co. Ltd, Tokushima, Japan) on all sides, except the top (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C11">Giang and Tanaka 2004</xref>). OTP is a multi-layer film consisting of three layers: the outer layer of TPX (4-methyl-1-pentane polymer) and the inner layer of CPP (a polypropylene) which are bonded together by a middle layer of polyolefin resins. The top seal film (OTP) is affixed to the top of the vessel after removing the paper backing to expose the adhesive. The medium substrate was rockwool (a 25 joined block, 5 × 5, of Grodan<sup>®</sup> Rockwool Multiblock™ AO 18/30, Grodania A/S, Denmark) with 180 mL of liquid medium. The rockwool was previously sterilized in a dry sterilizer (150 °C, 1 h), and placed in the ‘Vitron’. Then, sterilized liquid medium was poured evenly over the rockwool.CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment system under a CCFL light source.The photosynthetic light response curve and net photosynthetic rate were measured in the second leaf, counting from the top downwards, of plantlets, in which a pseudobulb was not formed, after culturing for 90 days. It was measured in at least five plants using a portable infrared gas analyser (LI-6400, Li-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). For obtaining the photosynthetic light response curve, the photon flux density that was provided from a red LED light source built into the top of the leaf chamber was changed from 300 to 0 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. The net photosynthetic rate was measured at 300 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (saturating or near-saturating PPFD). The CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and temperature in the leaf chamber were adjusted to maintain 400 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup> and 25 °C, respectively. The relative humidity in the leaf chamber was kept as close to 65–70 % as possible. The air flow rate was 200 mL min<sup>−1</sup>.Means were separated by ANOVA and significant differences were assessed by Tukey's multiple range test and a Student's <italic>t</italic>-test at <italic>P</italic> = 0.05.Effects of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and PPFD on the <italic>in vitro</italic> growth of <italic>Oncidesa</italic> plantlets under CCFL. <sup>x</sup>Chlorophyll content in the second leaf, counted from the top downwards, of the plantlets. <sup>y</sup>Different letters within a column indicate significant differences at <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05 by Tukey's multiple range test. <italic>n</italic> = 50. <sup>z</sup>Non-CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment.In <italic>Cymbidium</italic>, an increase in PPFD (using CCFLs) under 10 000 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup> CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment further enhanced the <italic>in vitro</italic> growth of both shoots and roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C24">Norikane <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). A similar trend was observed in <italic>Oncidesa</italic> plantlets in the present study; the number of leaves and roots, and shoot and root fresh and dry weights of the plantlets grown at 10 000 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup> CO<sub>2</sub> under high PPFD increased remarkably, although plant height, root length, and pseudobulb volume, fresh and dry weights and formation frequency did not differ between both PPFD levels under 10 000 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup> CO<sub>2</sub> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLT044TB1">1</xref>). Thus, we concluded that super-elevated CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment (10 000 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup> in the ‘Vitron’) with high PPFD (provided by CCFLs) also has a positive effect on the growth of both shoots and roots in <italic>Oncidesa</italic>.Effects of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and PPFD on the <italic>in vitro</italic> growth of <italic>Oncidesa</italic> plantlets under CCFLs.

In addition, CCFLs have several advantages over existing lighting systems used for plant tissue culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C31">Tanaka <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). In particular, CCFLs emit much less heat through their unique properties, allowing plants or cultures (culture vessels) to be placed very close to the light source, making more efficient use of the culture room and intensifying the efficiency of CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment. Our results indicate that there is great hope for using super-elevated CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment under CCFLs for more efficient and higher-quality commercial production of clonal orchid plantlets, which is a key objective of orchid biotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C18">Hossain <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT044C39">Teixeira da Silva 2013</xref>).All authors have made a substantial contribution to the manuscript and the research presented.
