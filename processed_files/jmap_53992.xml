Clay mineralogy of a soil sequence in slope deposits derived from hauptdolomit (dolomite) in the bavarian alpsClay mineralogy was determined in a sequence of soils formed in slope deposits derived from Hauptdolomit and ranging from a Mullrendzina (Rendoll) to a Terra fusca (Eutrochrept) and a Parabraunerde-Terra fusca (Hapludalf). Results indicated an alteration of illite to hydroxyl-Al interlayered clay in the course of soil formation. No evidence was found of formation of kaolinite in these soils. This clearly confirms all soils to have been formed under a recent cold humid climate. Furthermore clay mineral weathering starts even before carbonates are dissolved and completely removed from these soils.
