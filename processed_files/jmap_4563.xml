Effects of potassium and early-season nitrogen applications on young ‘Keisie’ canning peach trees on a sandy, infertile soilThe effects of different rates of potassium (K) and early season nitrogen (SN) were investigated in a ‘Keisie’ canning peach orchard on a sandy, infertile soil, at 1111 trees ha−1, in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Over the first four reasonably consistent bearing seasons (tree age 4 to 7 years) vegetative growth (trunk circumference) and yield were found to be sensitive to both × and SN. To sustain a crop of approximately 301 ha−1, annual × applications, in spring, at the rate of 124 g tree−1 were required. Nitrogen applications at full bloom (FB) at 133 g N tree−1, 42 days after FB at 67 g N tree−1, and again after shoot growth had ceased in autumn gave the best results (at 67 g N tree−1). At higher crop loads (c. 35.5 tons ha−1) × application rates of 300 g tree−1 season−1 may be required on similar sandy soils, possibly in association with rates of N application which exceed 267 g tree? season−1 (297 kg ha−1). Fruit quality was neither beneficially nor adversely affected by × and N fertilisation over the range of application rates utilised. High and low rates of application of K and N were nevertheless reflected by their concentrations in the leaves and fruit.
