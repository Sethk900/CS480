Reflections on the genus Amaga Ogren and Kawakatsu 1990, and description of a new genus of land planarian (Platyhelminthes: Tricladida: Geoplanidae)Amaga amagensis, the type species of the genus Amaga, and Amaga bogotensis are re-described. Detailed analysis of the morphology of A. amagensis revealed important taxonomic features, such as testes located dorsally to the supraintestinal parenchymal muscular layer, and secretory accumulations opening through the lateral margins of the body. These characters, as well as other morphological features, are discussed, culminating in an emendation of the generic diagnosis of Amaga. Amaga bogotensis exhibits a characteristic set of morphological features, namely an eversible penis, a male atrium lined with large musculosecretory papillae, and independent muscular coats around both male and female atrium. Therefore, a new genus is proposed for this species.
