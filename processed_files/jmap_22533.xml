Patterns of harvesting foliage and bark from the multipurpose tree Khaya senegalensis in Benin: Variation across ecological regions and its impacts on population structureNon-timber forest products (NTFPs) represent important resources for millions of communities worldwide. Concerns over NTFP overexploitation has led to a growing number of studies on the ecological impacts of harvest. Few studies however, have addressed species harvested for multiple parts or investigated how spatial variation affects harvest patterns and their impacts. We documented rates and patterns of pruning and debarking and their impacts on density and population structure, for 12 populations of the multiuse tree, Khaya senegalensis (Meliaceae) in two ecological regions (Sudano-Guinean versus Sudanian) of Benin, West Africa. Half of the populations had low or no harvest and half were highly harvested. Patterns of pruning and debarking were size-specific, with harvesters tending to prefer larger trees. Foliage harvest pressures were very high across both regions, with >70% of trees harvested for 100% of their crowns. A significantly greater proportion of trees were harvested for foliage in the wetter Sudano-Guinean region than in Sudanian region. The reverse was true for the proportion of foliage and bark-harvested per tree. In the Sudano-Guinean region, high harvest populations had significantly lower densities of seedlings and saplings than low harvest populations. The size-class distribution coefficient of skewness was significantly correlated with rainfall, habitat, and soil type. Variation in harvesting patterns and their ecological impacts can be explained in large part by differences in water availability between the two regions. Effective conservation plans for K. senegalensis require close consideration of the environmental and land-use context in which populations occur.
