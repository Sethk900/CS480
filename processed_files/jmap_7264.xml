A validade de Czosnowia Zdzitowiecki, 1967, a redescri√ßao de C. paraguayensis (Fischthal e Martin, 1978), n. comb. (Trematoda: Lecithodendriidae) e aspectos de sua patologia no f√≠gado do morc√™go, Molossus ater (Geoffrey), no BrasilThe validity of the genus Czosnowia Zdzitowiecki, 1967 (Trematoda: Lecithodendriidae), is discussed. Several authors have considered this genus a synonym of Postorchigenes Tubangui, 1928, but the position of the genital pore and the form of the cirrus sac indicate that both should be recognized as valid and distinct. P. mbopi Vaucher, 1981, and P. paraguayensis Fischthal & Martin, 1978, are transferred to Czosnowia. The species of Postorchigenes are listed and the distinguishing characteristics of the species of Czosnowia are indicated. C. paraguayensis n. comb, is re‚Ädescribed on the basis of material from livers of the bat, Molossus ater, taken in Manaus, Brazil. Our specimens differ from previous descriptions in the following ways: 1) the total length is from 1.3 to 4.7 times greater; 2) the metraterm has three visible regions, two being glandular and one muscular and 3) the cirrus sac lacks a prostatic vesicle. Additionally, our specimens are from a different host species and a new infection site. Infected livers are easily separated from uninfected ones by their yellowish coloration. His‚Ätologically, the walls of the infected bile ducts show thickening, metaplasia, with an increase in mucous cells, and a gradual deposition of collagen fibers.
