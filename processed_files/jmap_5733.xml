Arctic cheilostome bryozoan species of the genus EscharoidesThis investigation focuses on the diversity and identity of species of Escharoides found north of the Arctic Circle. Study of type and other material from this region using SEM shows that only two Arctic species can be recognized, Escharoides bidenkapi (Kluge) and E. jacksoni (Waters). The first of these is characterized by the distolateral orientation of the avicularia located beside the orifice, and by the suboral shelf on the distal border of the autozooidal orifice which is crenulated. Escharoides jacksoni differs in having slightly larger avicularia that are directed laterally, and a smooth suboral shelf.
