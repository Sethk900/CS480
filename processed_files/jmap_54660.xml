Quartz thermal activation energy as a tool in locating lithological discontinuities in Kentucky soils (U.S.A.)The enthalphy (ΔH) and the apparent activation energy (Ea) of the thermal inversion of soil quartz were investigated as a means of identifying lithological or age discontinuities in western and southwestern Kentucky soils. Five pedons were studied representing loess over limestone, loess over sandstone, and loess over siltstone lithological sequences. The Ea of quartz appeared to be more consistent than ΔH in marking the depth of the lithological discontinuity predicted by field morphology, particle size distribution, and Ti/Zr ratios in most pedons. In addition, three pedons formed completely in loess were analyzed, and an argument is presented that the Ea of quartz can be used to identify loess-loess contacts. The applicability of the method appears to rely on the sensitivity of Ea to reflect geothermal as well as geogenic and pedogenic alterations of quartz.
