Comparisons of using fitted (calculated) and determined (measured) genetic coefficient G2 in CERES-MaizeGenetic coefficients reflect simulated differences in cultivar growth and development. These are not readily available for most South African maize cultivars. They could either be fitted or determined experimentally. This study showed that the determined values of genetic coefficients are valuable starting points during evaluation and calibration, but that more work is needed to close the gap between determined and fitted values.
