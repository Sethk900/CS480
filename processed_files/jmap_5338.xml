Reproductive aspects of Leptodactytus hylaedactylus (Anura: Leptodactylidae), a member of the Leptodactylus marmoratus species group, with a description of tadpoles and callsIn this paper we describe some aspects of the reproductive biology of Leptodactylus hylaedactylus from open areas of Central Amazonia, Brazil. We describe the calling site, reproductive season, daily pattern of calling activity, chamber structure, vocalizations and tadpole morphology. Males of Leptodactylus hylaedactylus called amidst grasses and bushes in open and urban areas, throughout the year, and a greater number of males were heard in the period from 16:00 to 20:00 h. The eggs are deposited in underground chambers, which are spherical or elliptical. Larval development occurs inside the chambers. Two types of vocalizations were detected, the advertisement and the territorial call. The advertisement call of the species studied herein differs from other calls described for L. hylaedactylus from other localities of Brazil, but is very similar to that described from Peru. Tadpole morphology is similar to that described from individuals in French Guiana.
