Trogossitidae: A review of the beetle family, with a catalogue and keysAbstract The family Trogossitidae (Coleoptera: Cleroidea) is reviewed to species level. Keys to its genera, tribes and subfamilies are presented for the first time. All known species and subspecies are listed, together with complete taxonomic references back to 1910, the date of issue of the last catalogue of Trogossitidae. Higher taxa reviews are accompanied by remarks on phylogeny, distribution and biology as well as a brief description of adults and larvae. All known fossil records of Trogossitidae are reviewed and discussed. The work includes maps of distribution, colour photographs of generic representatives, morphological illustrations, SEM photographs and phylogenetic trees.
