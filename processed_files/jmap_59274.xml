Corn Yield Simulation Using the STICS Model under Varying Nitrogen Management and Climate-Change ScenariosAbstractThis study evaluated the performance of the simulateur multidisciplinaire pour les cultures standard (STICS) crop model for predicting grain yield and dry biomass of corn under three nitrogen (N) treatments—low, medium, and high N levels—applied on a conventional drainage field in eastern Canada over a 2-year period. The impacts of climate change on simulated grain corn and biomass yield in eastern Canada under tile-drained conditions was also evaluated over a 30-year future period (2040–2069). The 2008 data set was selected for calibration, whereas the 2009 data set was used for validation of the model. Corn grain yield was underestimated by 1.5–2.6  Mg ha−1 for the 2 years of measurement. Total dry biomass was also underestimated by 0.9–2.6  Mg ha−1. Tukey’s studentized range (HSD) test of corn grain yield indicated that yields at high and low N and high and medium N were different at the 95% confidence level. Grain and biomass production from 2040–2069 under B1 emission scenarios responded differently (P<0.05) for the three N treatments. A Mann–Kendall, nonparametric test performed on simulated corn grain and biomass yields attributable to climate change under B1 emission scenarios showed neither an increasing nor a decreasing trend at a 95% confidence level.
