Light responses of Carex planostachys from various microsites in a Juniperus communityJuniperus communities are found on over 50 × 106 ha in arid and semiarid habitats in southwestern North America. The drought tolerant sedge Carex planostachys occurs below the canopy in some of these communities. Cover and biomass of C. planostachys are high below the canopy and low in associated gaps. The purposes of this study were to investigate the temporal and spatial physiologic response of C. planostachys to abiotic changes, and determine it's light response characteristics from four contiguous microsites. Net photosynthesis was highest in spring when temperature was cooler and soil water higher, but low carbon uptake continued during summer drought. In addition, C. planostachys demonstrates a capacity to recover from extreme drought, despite water potential measured below −9.0 MPa. Based on physiological light response curves and gas-exchange measurements, C. planostachys appears tolerant of shaded and full sun habitats. Light levels below the canopy were reduced compared to the gaps, but light saturation of C. planostachys did not change and net CO2 uptake was only reduced slightly. Carbon uptake was coupled to light levels and not soil moisture. Observed differences in physiological attributes and variation in C. planostachys cover and biomass correspond to the presence or absence of the canopy. Low light compensation points, coupled with reduced respiratory demand, maximize photosynthetic gain in low light microsites. C. planostachys appears to acclimate across a range of light regimes, suggesting photosynthetic plasticity, allowing growth and survival in diverse light microhabitats. C. planostachys, tolerant of drought, appears anisohydric and demonstrates a capacity to acclimate to sun and shaded habitats, which could allow it to occur across a wider range of arid areas.
