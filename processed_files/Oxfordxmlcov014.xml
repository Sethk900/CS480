We evaluated effects of translocation on plasma corticosterone in a rare reptile (the tuatara). We found that translocated tuatara are resistant to cumulative stressors and show no hormonal sign of chronic stress.Translocations are an important conservation tool used to restore at-risk species to their historical range. Unavoidable procedures during translocations, such as habitat disturbance, capture, handling, processing, captivity, transport and release to a novel environment, have the potential to be stressful for most species. In this study, we examined acute and chronic stress (through the measurement of the glucocorticoid corticosterone) in a rare reptile (the tuatara, <italic>Sphenodon punctatus</italic>). We found that: (i) the acute corticosterone response remains elevated during the initial translocation process but is not amplified by cumulative stressors; and (ii) the long-term dynamics of corticosterone secretion are similar in translocated and source populations. Taken together, our results show that translocated tuatara are generally resistant to cumulative acute stressors and show no hormonal sign of chronic stress. Translocation efforts in tuatara afford the potential to reduce extinction risk and restore natural ecosystems.Translocations are human-assisted movements of living organisms from one area to another and are an important tool for conservation efforts and population restoration of species at risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C4">Armstrong and Seddon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C26">Ewen <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C65">Seddon <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recognizes two types of conservation translocation to restore populations, namely (i) reinforcements, in which individuals are released into an existing population of conspecifics to enhance the sustainability of populations, and (ii) reintroductions, in which individuals are released in a historically occupied area in order to re-establish a population after extirpation. Although these types of movements are ultimately aimed at helping species, the translocation process is inherently stressful, because associated procedures, such as habitat disturbance, capture, handling, processing, captivity, transport and release to a novel environment, are necessary and unavoidable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C35">Germano and Bishop, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C21">Dickens <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C55">Parker <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). In a recent review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C69">Tarszisz <italic>et al</italic>. (2014)</xref> identified physiology as a key disciplinary area that is lacking attention in conservation translocations and also highlighted how physiological data can improve short- and long-term translocation success.In vertebrates, the acute stress response produces a rapid increase in glucocorticoid hormone secretion [corticosterone (CORT) or cortisol] to help individuals cope with immediate stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C79">Wingfield <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>); consequently, non-essential processes (such as reproduction and growth) are suspended until homeostasis returns. Although the stress response serves to promote immediate survival, prolonged or sustained CORT secretion (typically expected during translocations) can manifest as &lsquo;chronic stress&rsquo; and is generally considered detrimental to overall health and fitness (i.e. the CORT-Fitness Hypothesis; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C63">Sapolsky <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C78">Wingfield and Sapolsky, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C10">Bonier <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C55">Parker <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C2">Almasi <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). In a recent review of the associations between stress and movement of animals, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C71">Teixeira <italic>et al</italic>. (2007)</xref> concluded that stress is a contributing factor to the success or failure of a translocation project. Stress induced by the initial translocation process and relocation to a novel environment increases the vulnerability of individuals to reproductive failure, disease, starvation, predation and long-range dispersal, thereby decreasing the chance that individuals will survive and that a self-sustaining population will result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C71">Teixeira <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C20">Dickens <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C21">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C55">Parker <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>).Measuring and monitoring CORT secretion is the most widely used method for assessing stress in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C76">Wikelski and Cooke, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C21">Dickens <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C66">Sheriff <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Although several factors relevant to translocation efforts influence CORT secretion, studies that assess and monitor stress (by way of CORT secretion) throughout and after the translocation process are limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C35">Germano and Bishop, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C36">Harrington <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C69">Tarszisz <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Numerous studies have shown that associated procedures commonly applied in translocation programmes (such as capture, handling and transport) stimulate a significant stress response and influence CORT secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C27">Fazio and Ferlazzo, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C48">Langkilde and Shine, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C52">Narayan and Hero, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C9">Bliley and Woodley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C5">Baker <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C28">Fazio <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>).

In addition to experiencing acute stressors during the initial translocation process, translocated individuals released into new environments are faced with several survival challenges (such as finding food and shelter and avoiding predators); therefore, physiological stress is inevitable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C71">Teixeira <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).Here, we examine the acute CORT response and long-term dynamics of CORT secretion through the translocation process in a rare reptile, the tuatara (<italic>Sphenodon punctatus</italic>). The tuatara is a protected reptile endemic to New Zealand and is the only living representative of the reptilian order Rhynchocephalia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C43">Jones and Cree, 2012</xref>). Although the tuatara is now considered non-threatened but &lsquo;at-risk &ndash; relict&rsquo; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C39">Hitchmough <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>), translocations contribute to conservation and ecological restoration efforts and serve to re-&shy;establish tuatara within their pre-human range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C39">Hitchmough <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C15">Cree, 2014</xref>). In addition to easing extinction pressure, translocations also offer a chance to examine and address relevant research questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C35">Germano and Bishop, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C51">Miller <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C15">Cree, 2014</xref>). In 2012, wild tuatara were translocated to six island and mainland sanctuaries from two source populations (Lady Alice Island and Stephens Island/Takapourewa, New Zealand; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C15">Cree, 2014</xref>), which presented an excellent opportunity to examine the CORT response to translocation in multiple populations. Previous studies have examined patterns of CORT secretion in tuatara; in general, baseline CORT in tuatara is fairly low (with plasma concentrations typically 2&ndash;5&emsp14;ng/ml), a significant CORT response to capture restraint is observed, and female reproductive condition, body temperature and season (but not time of day) are influential factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C73">Tyrrell and Cree, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C74">Tyrrell <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C3">Anderson <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). In a recent study examining CORT secretion in four populations of tuatara, we found that baseline CORT was similar among all populations; however, the CORT response varied with latitude, seabird density, sex ratio and genetic diversity (L. Anderson, N. Nelson, D. Towns and A. Cree, unpublished data). Although translocations of tuatara continue to take place, CORT secretion (as an indicator of stress) during and after the translocation process has not been examined. Comparing CORT secretion simultaneously in translocated and source populations of tuatara would allow detection of altered CORT secretion that is correlated with environmental and/or habitat change and that would be an indication of chronic stress.This study had two aims. First, we examined the acute CORT response in tuatara at different stages of the initial translocation process and tested the prediction that the acute CORT response would be amplified with cumulative stressors. Second, we tested whether long-term changes in CORT secretion provide evidence of &lsquo;chronic stress&rsquo; in three translocated populations (compared with the corresponding source populations as control animals). We made the following predictions: (i) baseline CORT (post-translocation) would be similar among all populations; and (ii) the CORT response (post-translocation) would be amplified in translocated populations that experienced a marked environmental and/or habitat change (e.g. a greater latitudinal shift). Moreover, body condition indices (mass relative to snout&ndash;vent length) in translocated populations (along with source populations as control animals) were examined, because chronic stress can influence energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C62">Romero, 2002</xref>).Populations involved in short- and long-term monitoring of physiological data (corticosterone) throughout a conservation translocation programme in New Zealand. Source populations (open circles) and translocated populations (filled circles) are shown.Schematic diagram of short-term (upper panel) and long-term monitoring (lower panel) during the translocations to Motuihe Island from Lady Alice Island in March 2012 (translocation &lsquo;A&rsquo;) and to Cape Kidnappers and Sanctuary Mountain Maungatautari from Stephens Island in October 2012 (translocation &lsquo;B&rsquo;). Short-term monitoring was carried out during translocation A only. Comparisons for long-term monitoring were made between source (dark grey) and translocated populations (light grey). The sex ratio (M:F) for each population is shown.In translocation A only, we examined the acute CORT response (i.e. CORT secretion above baseline) through all stages of the initial translocation process, during which standard translocation protocols were followed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C72">Towns <italic>et al</italic>., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C16">Cromarty and Alderson, 2013</xref>). In summary, adult tuatara (snout&ndash;vent length &ge;170&emsp14;mm) that had emerged from their underground burrows were captured by hand (between 20.00 and 04.00&emsp14;h), and sex was identified by examining secondary sex characteristics, such as head size/shape, body shape, spine shape and crest development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C15">Cree, 2014</xref>).All individuals in the translocation programme were subjected to a capture-restraint &lsquo;hold&rsquo; [which involved capture of individuals and initial holding (between 40 and 60&emsp14;h) in cloth capture bags], processing (which involved handling, weighing, measuring and implantation of a passive integrated transponder tag) and transfer to the release site [which involved holding (between 6 and 10&emsp14;h) in perforated cardboard postal tubes (10&emsp14;cm&emsp14;&times;&emsp14;50&emsp14;cm), movement by foot to the helicopter pick-up site, a 30&emsp14;min helicopter flight, unloading and a 30&emsp14;min &shy;handing-over ceremony upon arrival at Motuihe Island].To determine the acute CORT response at different stages of the translocation programme, we collected baseline CORT samples (following the blood sampling protocol described below in the &lsquo;<italic>Sampling protocol</italic>&rsquo; section) from tuatara at capture (0&emsp14;h; <italic>n</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;54) and collected a second sample after one of the following: (i) an 18&emsp14;h hold (<italic>n</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;15); (ii) a 42&emsp14;h hold (<italic>n</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;14); (iii) a 42&emsp14;h hold&emsp14;&plus;&emsp14;process&emsp14;&plus;&emsp14;transfer (<italic>n</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;11); or (iv) a 66&emsp14;h hold&emsp14;&plus;&emsp14;process&emsp14;&plus;&emsp14;transfer (<italic>n</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;14). Tuatara do not show significant daily variation in baseline CORT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C73">Tyrrell and Cree, 1998</xref>); therefore, the time of day at sampling is unlikely to contribute to variation in CORT secretion in this study.Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COV014F2">2</xref> presents a schematic diagram of samples obtained during translocations A and B and displays sex ratios (M:F) for each population. For all samples, adult tuatara (both sexes) were captured at night by hand (between 20.00 and 04.00&emsp14;h). Upon capture, a baseline CORT sample was obtained, and after 3&emsp14;h capture restraint in a cloth bag, a second sample was obtained to determine the CORT response. In translocation A, we collected samples from the source population (Lady Alice Island; LA) before translocation (March 2012) and from the source (LA) and translocated (Motuihe Island; Mot) populations at 12&emsp14;months post-translocation (March 2013). In translocation B, we collected samples from the source population (Stephens Island; ST) before translocation (October 2012) and from the source (ST) and translocated [Cape Kidnappers (CK) or Sanctuary Mountain Maungatautari (MT)] populations at 6&emsp14;months post-translocation (March 2013). Given that significant seasonal variation in CORT secretion has been observed between the breeding (March) and non-breeding (October) seasons in tuatara (L. Anderson, N. Nelson, D. Towns and A. Cree, unpublished data), we also analysed samples from the ST source population (obtained in a previous study; March 2012) for annual comparison. In order to determine whether the release site (within a translocated population) had a significant effect on CORT secretion, we collected post-&shy;translocation samples from two separate release-site locations on Mot (site 1&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;Orchards Bush and site 2&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;Von Luckner&apos;s Bush) and at MT (site 1&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;Tuatarium and site 2&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;Northern Enclosure).Depending on field conditions (i.e. electricity available or not), blood samples were separated either by centrifuge (5&emsp14;min at 480 <italic>g</italic>) or under normal gravity for 6&ndash;8&emsp14;h at 4&deg;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C60">Reimers <italic>et al</italic>., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C66">Sheriff <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C3">Anderson <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Plasma was transferred into cryogenic vials with a micropipette, stored in a cryogenic dry shipper (Thermo ScientificTM, Arctic ExpressTM Dual 10) or in a freezer at &minus;20&deg;C until return to the laboratory, and then stored at &minus;80&deg;C until assayed. Corticosterone was analysed with commercial enzyme immunoassay kits (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI, USA) using a previously described method validated for tuatara (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C3">Anderson <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Briefly, CORT was extracted from plasma samples with redistilled dichloromethane, and each sample was assayed in duplicate. For each extraction, a subset of tritiated CORT samples were analysed to measure extraction recovery. Extraction recovery was 106&emsp14;&plusmn;&emsp14;8&percnt; (mean&emsp14;&plusmn;&emsp14;SD) with an overall coefficient of variation of 7&percnt;. Intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation were 9.9 and 14.2&percnt;, respectively.Data analyses were carried out using R v3.2.0 statistical software (R Development Core, 2013) and Prism 6 (Graphpad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). All data were checked for assumptions of normality and were transformed if necessary. Linear mixed effects regression (LMER) models were fitted using the &lsquo;lme4&rsquo; package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C6">Bates, 2013</xref>) in R to analyse the following: (i) the acute CORT response during the initial translocation process; and (ii) the long-term dynamics of CORT secretion in translocated populations. Models were constructed through forward/backward stepwise regression procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C29">Field <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). In all LMER models, a random effect of tuatara identity was included to account for repeat sampling of individuals. The &lsquo;lmerTest&rsquo; package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C46">Kuznetsova, 2013</xref>) was used to compute <italic>P</italic>-values for coefficients in final models, and significance was assumed at <italic>P</italic>&emsp14;&lt;&emsp14;0.05.In analysis 1 (short-term monitoring), log-transformed CORT was the response variable, and sample (baseline, 18&emsp14;h hold, 42&emsp14;h hold, 42&emsp14;h hold&emsp14;&plus;&emsp14;processing&emsp14;&plus;&emsp14;transfer or 66&emsp14;h hold&emsp14;&plus;&emsp14;processing&emsp14;&plus;&emsp14;transfer) was the input variable. In analysis 2 (long-term monitoring), we first examined whether CORT secretion varied by release site within translocated populations, with log-transformed CORT the response variable and input variables of hour (0 or 3&emsp14;h), site (site 1 or site 2) and an interaction term of hour&emsp14;&times;&emsp14;site. Models were fitted to data from Motuihe Island and Sanctuary Mountain Maungatautari, because these translocated populations had two separate release locations. Then, we compared CORT secretion between translocated and source (control) populations, with log-transformed CORT the response variable and input variables of hour (0 or 3&emsp14;h), sample (source pre-, source post-, translocated pre- or translocated post-) and an interaction term of hour&emsp14;&times;&emsp14;sample. Lastly, we compared body condition pre- and post-&shy;translocation, with body condition score (log mass/log snout&ndash;vent length) the response variable and sample (source pre-, source post-, translocated pre- or translocated post-) the input variable.

Dynamics of corticosterone (CORT) secretion (shown as means&emsp14;&plus;&emsp14;SEM) in populations of tuatara (<italic>S. punctatus</italic>) translocated to: (<bold>a</bold>) Motuihe Island from Lady Alice Island (LA); and (<bold>b</bold>) Cape Kidnappers Sanctuary (CK) and Sanctuary Mountain Maungatautari (MT) from Stephens Island (ST). Sample size (<italic>n</italic>) is indicated by the number at the base of each bar and represents a paired sampled of baseline CORT (black bars) and the CORT response (3&emsp14;h minus 0&emsp14;h; grey bars) taken from all individuals. Bars that share identical letters are not significantly different (<italic>P</italic>&emsp14;&gt;&emsp14;0.05).In translocation B, CORT secretion varied between translocated (CK and MT) and source (ST) populations at 6&emsp14;months post-translocation. Baseline CORT was significantly lower in one translocated population (CK; LMER, <italic>t</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;&minus;2.345, <italic>P</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;0.020), but was similar in the other translocated population (MT; LMER, <italic>t</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;&minus;0.925, <italic>P</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;0.356) compared with the source (ST) population (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COV014F4">4</xref>b). The CORT response was similar in one translocated population (CK; LMER, <italic>t</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;&minus;1.247, <italic>P</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;0.213), but was significantly higher in the other translocated population (MT; LMER, <italic>t</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;1.991, <italic>P</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;0.048) compared with the source (ST) population (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COV014F4">4</xref>b). Corticosterone secretion (both baseline CORT and the CORT response) was similar between the two translocated populations (CK and MT; baseline CORT, LMER, <italic>t</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;1.210, <italic>P</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;0.227; and CORT response, LMER, <italic>t</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;0.745, <italic>P</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;0.457; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COV014F4">4</xref>b). Corticosterone secretion in the source (ST) population was similar between both pre-translocation samples (March 2012 vs. October 2012; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COV014TB2">2</xref>b and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COV014F4">4</xref>b). In all populations, baseline CORT was significantly higher at 6&emsp14;months post-translocation (March 2013) compared with both pre-translocation samples (March 2012 and October 2012; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COV014TB2">2</xref>b and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COV014F4">4</xref>b). The CORT response was similar pre- and post-translocation in the two translocated populations (CK and MT), but was significantly lower post-translocation in the source (ST) population (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COV014TB2">2</xref>b and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COV014F4">4</xref>b).Body condition scores (log mass/log snout&ndash;vent length) in populations of tuatara (<italic>S. punctatus</italic>) translocated to: (<bold>a</bold>) Motuihe Island from Lady Alice Island (LA); and (<bold>b</bold>) Cape Kidnappers Sanctuary (CK) and Sanctuary Mountain Maungatautari (MT) from Stephens Island (ST). Data points (means&emsp14;&plusmn;&emsp14;SEM) that share identical letters are not significantly different (<italic>P</italic>&emsp14;&gt;&emsp14;0.05).In translocation B, body condition at 6&emsp14;months post-translocation was similar in one translocated population (CK; LMER, <italic>t</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;&minus;1.351, <italic>P</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;0.179) but was significantly lower in the other translocated population (MT; LMER, <italic>t</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;&minus;3.058, <italic>P</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;0.003) compared with the source (ST) population (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COV014F5">5</xref>b). Furthermore, body condition in the translocated populations (CK and MT) varied, because body condition was significantly lower in the MT population compared with the CK population (LMER, <italic>t</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;&minus;4.022, <italic>P</italic>&emsp14;&lt;&emsp14;0.001; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COV014F5">5</xref>b). Body condition was similar post-translocation (March 2013) compared with pre-translocation (March 2012 and October 2012) in the translocated (CK) and source (ST) populations, but was significantly lower in the translocated (MT) population (CK, LMER, <italic>t</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;1.261, <italic>P</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;0.210; and MT, LMER, <italic>t</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;&minus;3.083, <italic>P</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;0.003; ST: LMER, <italic>t</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;&minus;0.077, <italic>P</italic>&emsp14;&equals;&emsp14;0.938, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COV014F5">5</xref>b).Here, for the first time, we examined CORT secretion throughout the entire translocation process in a rare reptile (the tuatara, <italic>S. punctatus</italic>). Our findings were as follows: (i) plasma CORT concentrations remain elevated throughout the initial translocation process (short-term monitoring between 18 and 66&emsp14;h) but are not amplified by cumulative stressors; and (ii) the long-term dynamics of CORT secretion are similar in translocated and source populations. Taken together, our results show that tuatara are generally resilient to cumulative acute stressors and to chronic translocation stress.To our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify the effect of cumulative stressors (routinely experienced in a translocation) on the acute CORT response in a reptile. We expected to see an effect of additive stressors on the acute CORT response, but this was not the case. The CORT response peaked at 18&emsp14;h of holding/captivity restraint, and additional processing procedures of measurements, microchip insertion and air transfer did not increase CORT secretion further, suggesting resistance to cumulative stressors in this species. Some species show diel variation of CORT secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C13">Breuner <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C44">Jones and Bell, 2004</xref>), which can confound interpretation of results if samples are not taken at 24&emsp14;h intervals; however, no evidence of a diel cycle has been found in the tuatara (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C73">Tyrrell and Cree, 1998</xref>). Nevertheless, a significant CORT response was observed throughout all stages of the translocation process, and at no point did CORT returned to baseline concentrations. This observation is consistent with results from our previous study examining the acute CORT response to capture restraint in tuatara, in which a return to baseline CORT concentrations was not observed over 24&emsp14;h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C3">Anderson <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we recommend that animal disturbance, holding time, transport duration and post-translocation disturbance be minimized in tuatara to mitigate potentially harmful effects of sustained CORT secretion in individuals directly following translocation.In the present study, we did not examine patterns of CORT secretion in the immediate weeks following translocation (our first follow-up sampling occurred at 6&emsp14;months post-translocation). Consequently, we are lacking information on the speed of recovery to baseline CORT secretion levels. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C48">Langkilde and Shine (2006)</xref> found that CORT secretion in male and female lizards (<italic>Eulamprus heatwolei</italic>) subjected to microchip &shy;implantation remained elevated at 14&emsp14;days (post-treatment) and &shy;subsequently increased in response to additional stressors at that time. Likewise, tortoises (<italic>Testudo hermanni</italic>) that experienced handling plus ground transport had increased baseline CORT at 4&emsp14;weeks (post-stressor), compared with a control group that experienced handling only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C28">Fazio <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). These studies have shown that short-term CORT secretion dynamics are significantly altered by processes experienced during a translocation; therefore, obtaining supplementary information on short-term patterns (within 4&emsp14;weeks post-translocation) of CORT secretion in tuatara would shed light on the presence of a sustained CORT response and speed of recovery/negative feedback dynamics following translocation.Summary of long-term dynamics of baseline CORT, the 3&emsp14;h CORT response and body condition at 12&emsp14;months post-translocation in source (Lady Alice Island or Stephens Island) and translocated populations (Motuihe Island, Cape Kidnappers or Sanctuary Mountain)Arrows indicate direction of change and asterisks denote level of significance (&ast;&ast;<italic>P</italic>&emsp14;&lt;&emsp14;0.01 and &ast;&ast;&ast;<italic>P</italic>&emsp14;&lt;&emsp14;0.001). Abbreviation: CORT, corticosterone.Unexpectedly, through long-term monitoring in this study, we observed a significant annual increase in baseline CORT among all source and translocated populations (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COV014TB3">3</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COV014F4">4</xref>), probably indicating a ubiquitous environmental effect. The CORT response was unaltered in all populations, with the exception of the Stephens Island source population, where the CORT response was reduced at 12&emsp14;months post-&shy;translocation (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COV014TB3">3</xref>). Body condition declined in the Lady Alice source population and the Motuihe Island and Cape Kidnappers translocated populations. Moreover, these results highlight the importance of collecting information simultaneously from source populations (as a control), because without this our results of increased baseline CORT in all translocated populations and reduced body condition in two out of three translocated populations could have been erroneously interpreted as an indication of chronic stress.It is probable that we detected an unplanned/unexpected effect of drought on baseline CORT secretion in tuatara. In 2012&ndash;2013, New Zealand experienced its worst drought in 40&emsp14;years, with the North Island affected more severely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C56">Porteous and Mullan, 2013</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C47">Lance <italic>et al</italic>. (2010)</xref> observed increased plasma CORT in alligators (<italic>Alligator mississippiensis</italic>) experiencing a severe drought, and recovery of CORT concentrations (to within normal limits) was observed after substantial rainfall. Although dehydration stress was not directly measured (by way of CORT secretion), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C18">Davis and DeNardo (2009)</xref> found that water supplementation in a long-lived desert lizard (the Gila monster, <italic>Heloderma suspectum</italic>) led to greater hydration, tail-fat reserves and surface activity. In a recent experimental study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C24">Dupoue <italic>et al</italic>. (2014)</xref> examined CORT secretion in water-deprived snakes (<italic>Antaresia childreni</italic>) and found that the CORT response, but not baseline CORT, was significantly higher in dehydrated snakes, and the loss of body mass was two to four times greater, compared with controls. The authors suggest that baseline CORT in snakes may respond only to a more severe degree of dehydration and that reduced locomotion (to reduce levels of dehydration) may explain the amplified CORT response in water-deprived snakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C24">Dupoue <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>).Reptiles, including tuatara, can moderate water loss through behavioural adaptations, such as limiting movement/locomotion and retreating to (or not emerging from) burrows, caves, fallen logs or undersides of rocks, where humidity is higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C77">Wilson <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C11">Bonnet and Brischoux, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C18">Davis and DeNardo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C15">Cree, 2014</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C23">Dunlap (1995)</xref> found that lizards (<italic>Sceloporus occidentalis</italic>) that were more active (compared with less active) during a drought experienced greater changes in physiological measures (e.g. CORT, weight loss, haematocrit and osmolality). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C23">Dunlap (1995)</xref> suggested that individual variation in behavioural responses of reptiles (e.g. remaining active during drought) can lead to biased analysis of stress in natural populations. Burrowing in tuatara reduces water loss by up to three times the rate experienced when emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C15">Cree, 2014</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the increased baseline CORT observed in our study is influenced by sampling bias (capturing active individuals out of burrows rather than inactive individuals remaining in burrows).Contrary to our prediction, an amplified CORT response (post-translocation) was not observed in translocated populations experiencing a shift to warmer climates/lower latitudes, specifically the Cape Kidnappers and Sanctuary Mountain translocated populations. In previous studies, we observed an amplified CORT response in tuatara at higher temperatures (L. Anderson, N. Nelson and A. Cree, unpublished data) and at lower latitudes (L. Anderson, N. Nelson, D. Towns and A. Cree, unpublished data). The Stephens Island (40&deg; 40&prime; S) source population showed a reduced CORT response (from pre-translocation to post-translocation), which was not observed in the Cape Kidnappers (39&deg; 64&prime; S) and Sanctuary Mountain (38&deg; 30&prime; S) translocated populations (in which the CORT response was unaltered). Likewise, individuals translocated to Motuihe Island (35&deg; 58&prime; S) from Lady Alice Island (35&deg; 53&prime; S) did not show an altered CORT response. It is possible that the individuals translocated from Stephens Island (to Cape Kidnappers and Sanctuary Mountain) would have shown a dampened CORT response (at 12&emsp14;months) if they remained on Stephens Island or were translocated to equal or higher latitudes. Examining CORT secretion in tuatara populations translocated to equal/higher latitudes [e.g. to Orokonui Ecosanctuary (45&deg; 77&prime; S) from Stephens Island; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C15">Cree, 2014</xref>], might clarify the effects of latitudinal/climate change on the CORT response.Although body condition did not statistically influence CORT secretion in our study, the sustained body condition in the Cape Kidnappers translocated population and in the Stephens Island source population suggests better hydration at these sites in the midst of a drought. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C56">Porteous and Mullan (2013)</xref> report that New Zealand&apos;s South Island (close to where Stephens Island is located) was not affected as severely as the North Island, and better hydration in the Cape Kidnappers population was probably achieved through provision of supplementary water sources (L. Anderson, personal observation). Reduced body condition has been observed in dehydrated/water-restricted reptiles, including snakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C24">Dupoue <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C50">Lillywhite <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>), lizards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C68">Summers and Norman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C23">Dunlap, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C18">Davis and DeNardo, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C19">2010</xref>), alligators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C47">Lance <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>) and turtles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C58">Ray <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C59">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COV014C75">van de Merwe <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Clearly, information on relationships among water availability/dehydration, body condition, stress and CORT secretion is lacking and should be considered in light of imminent &shy;climate change.This work was supported by <grant-sponsor>Victoria University of Wellington</grant-sponsor>, the <grant-sponsor>Allan Wilson Centre for Molecular Ecology and Evolution</grant-sponsor>, the <grant-sponsor>Centre for Biodiversity and Restoration Ecology</grant-sponsor> and the <grant-sponsor>San Diego Zoo</grant-sponsor>.We would like to thank Ng&#x0101;ti K&#x014D;ata iwi, Ng&#x0101;ti wai iwi, Te &#x0100;ti Awa iwi, Ngai Tai Ki Tamaki iwi, Ngati Paoa iwi, the New Zealand Department of Conservation (DOC) and the Natural Heritage Management Committee (Sanctuary Mountain Maungatautari) for permission to carry out this research.
