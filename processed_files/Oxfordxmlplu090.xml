We found that Citrus flower buds smaller than 8 mm long have constitutive structural and biochemical barriers to <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> spp. infection.

Our study shows that natural terpenes of Citrus flowers present a potential use for chemical control of <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> spp.The constitutive characters of plants can be structural or biochemical and play an important role in their defence against pathogens. Citrus postbloom fruit drop (PFD) caused by <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> spp. is one of the most important fungal diseases of citrus. The pathogen infects the flowers, leading to premature fruit drop and reducing citrus production. However, flower buds smaller than 8 mm long are usually not infected by <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> spp. Thus, this study investigated whether there are constitutive mechanisms in flower buds related to <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> spp. infection. We studied flower buds that were 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 and 15 mm long and petals, after anthesis, of sweet orange â€˜ValÃªnciaâ€™ using light and scanning electron microscopy and histochemistry. We evaluated the effect of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in flowers (R-limonene and linalool) on the <italic>in vitro</italic> growth of <italic>Colletotrichum acutatum</italic>. We found that the arrangement of the epidermal papillae in the petal primordia, the occurrence of prismatic crystals and the distribution of oil glands are the main differences between buds smaller than 8 mm and buds 8â€“15 mm long. Osmophores at the tips of petals produced and accumulated phenols, terpenes and lipophilic compounds. Flower buds smaller than 8 mm long have constitutive structural and biochemical barriers to <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> spp. infection. In addition, this is the first time that osmophores have been reported in citrus. Our study shows that natural terpenes of <italic>Citrus</italic> flowers inhibit the fungal growth <italic>in vitro</italic>, highlighting the potential use of terpenes for the chemical control of PFD in citrus.Plant species are attacked by a wide range of pathogens and herbivores, which can alter host survival, growth and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C58">Wittstock and Gershenzon 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C1">Agrios 2005</xref>). Plants defend themselves against these enemies using a combination of structural characters and biochemical reactions, which can be either constitutive or induced by attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C58">Wittstock and Gershenzon 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C1">Agrios 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C24">Hanley <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). Constitutive structural traits important to pathogen resistance include cell walls with different compositions, waxy epidermal cuticles, cuticles thickness, trichomes, idioblasts, sclereids and crystalliferous cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C26">Hudgins <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C53">Smith <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C23">Freeman and Beattie 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C33">Koch and Ensikat 2008</xref>).Citrus postbloom fruit drop (PFD) is a disease caused by <italic>Colletotrichum acutatum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C5">Brown <italic>et al</italic>. 1996</xref>) and <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C38">Lima <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C41">McGovern <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>), both from phylum Ascomycota. The disease causes serious economic production losses of sweet oranges and is considered a limiting factor for producing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C55">Timmer <italic>et al</italic>. 1994</xref>). In Brazil, losses caused by PFD can reach 80 % when the flowering coincides with periods of heavy rainfall in areas without the disease control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C16">De Goes <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C52">Silva-Junior <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>).These pathogens can infect flower buds that are still closed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C21">Fagan 1979</xref>), although most symptoms are observed during anthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C17">Denham and Waller 1981</xref>). In the petals, the pathogen penetrates intra- and intercellularly, and also through the stomata. After invasion, acervuli (asexual fruiting bodies) are observed on both sides of the petals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C40">Marques <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). Typical symptoms are orange-brown lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C21">Fagan 1979</xref>). The lesions bearing salmon pink acervuli expand rapidly in favourable weather and soon involve all the petal tissues. This stage of the disease is often called blossom blight. The blighted petals remain firmly attached to the basal disc and become hard, dry and reddish brown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C17">Denham and Waller 1981</xref>). In the stigma, small peach-brown to dark-brown necrotic spots are formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C39">Lin <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>), but the pathogen does not penetrate through the epidermal cells of the stigma. A protective lipophilic layer rich in phenolic compounds is formed under the necrotic area, and crystals of calcium oxalate (CaO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic>) are produced where the pathogen is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C40">Marques <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). After infection, hormonal changes occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C37">Li <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C35">Lahey <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>) leading to premature fruit drop and calyx retention for long periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C55">Timmer <italic>et al</italic>. 1994</xref>).The developmental stages of flower buds are directly related to the infection caused by <italic>C. acutatum</italic> and efficiency of PFD control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C21">Fagan 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C48">Roberto and Borges 2001</xref>). Flower buds smaller than 8 mm are considered resistant to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C21">Fagan 1979</xref>) and as the flower bud size increases, the buds become more susceptible to the infection. Thus, preventive applications of fungicides are recommended when most petals emerge above the calyx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C52">Silva-Junior <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>).Citrus plants produce volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as secondary metabolites that play an important role in interaction routes with microorganisms. In citrus plants, the quantity of VOCs is variable and depends on the organ age and type. In the pericarp of green fruits, the oil is composed of Î²-pinene, sabinene and linalool; however, in ripe fruits, R-limonene and linalool become the most prevalent oils. In petals, the oils include terpenes R-limonene, myrcene, sabinine, linalool, terpineol and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C3">Attaway <italic>et al</italic>. 1966</xref>). To date, there is no evidence of the site where the synthesis and/or emission of volatiles occur on citrus petals. In several families, the sites where the synthesis occurs are called osmophores or scent glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C62">Vogel 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C19">Dudareva and Pichersky 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C20">Effemert <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>). Osmophores have been reported only once for the Rutaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C6">Bussell <italic>et al</italic>. 1995</xref>). Volatile organic compounds are produced naturally in plants and may be associated with constitutive biochemical defence mechanisms. They can also be extracted and used as an alternative to conventional chemical control, as they present fewer environmental hazards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C57">Wightwick <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>).Floral buds smaller than 8 mm are considered resistant to pathogen infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C21">Fagan 1979</xref>). However, the mechanisms involved in this resistance have never been determined. We hypothesized that floral buds smaller than 8 mm have constitutive structural and chemical barriers that are associated with the resistance of those buds. This study aims to describe the anatomical structure of flower buds at different developmental stages to identify the presence of constitutive defences to infection caused by <italic>C. acutatum</italic>. We also evaluated the effect of the most common VOCs in flowers on the <italic>in vitro</italic> growth of <italic>C. acutatum</italic>, to verify their contribution to bud resistance.Five-year-old potted sweet orange plants [<italic>Citrus sinensis</italic> var. ValÃªncia] were grown in 5-L plastic pots and maintained in a greenhouse at the Fund for Citrus Plant Protection (FUNDECITRUS), located in the municipality of Araraquara, SÃ£o Paulo State, Brazil. Flowering was induced by pruning and water restriction. Small flower buds with 2, 3 and 4 mm, flower buds with expanded corolla (8, 12 and 15 mm), and petals after anthesis were collected for anatomical analyses.The flower buds and the petals were collected, longitudinally sectioned and fixed in Karnovsky fixative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C31">Karnovsky 1965</xref>; modified by phosphate buffer pH 7.2) for 48 h. During this phase, the samples were placed in a vacuum pump to remove air bubbles formed in the tissues. The samples were then dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and embedded in Leica historesin<sup>Â®</sup> (Heraeus Kulzer, Hanau, Germany). Flower buds were also fixed in formalin-ferrous sulfate solution to detect phenolic compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C30">Johansen 1940</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C28">Jensen 1962</xref>). The infiltration time of the flower buds was 1 month or more, depending on the developmental stage of the buds. The blocks were sliced in a Leica RM 2045 rotary microtome to produce 5â€“7-Î¼m thick sections. The sections were mounted on glass slides and stained with 1 % Toluidine Blue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C50">Sakai 1973</xref>) for histological analyses. The slides were mounted in synthetic resin Entellan<sup>Â®</sup> (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).For histochemical analysis, Sudan black B was used to detect lipophilic compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C44">Pearse 1968</xref>), 10 % ferric chloride was used to detect phenolic substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C30">Johansen 1940</xref>) and Ruthenium red for pectic compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C11">Chamberlain 1932</xref>). After staining, the slides were embedded in the synthetic resin Entellan<sup>Â®</sup>. Calcium oxalate crystals were visualized under polarized light and their chemical nature was confirmed by analyzing their solubility in 1 % sulfuric acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C30">Johansen 1940</xref>). To confirm the presence of osmophores on the petal primordia and petal apex, samples were collected and immediately cross-sectioned on a sliding microtome Leica MS 2000R. To identify and characterize the osmophores' secretions the following histochemical techniques were used: rhodamine B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C29">Jin <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>) for sugar esters; Neutral Red (0.01 % in aqueous solution pH 8.0) to detect secretory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C19">Dudareva and Pichersky 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C20">Effemert <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>); Nadi reagent for terpenoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C15">David and Carde 1964</xref>); Nile blue sulfate for acidic and neutral lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C8">Cain 1947</xref>); and 10 % ferric chloride for phenolic compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C30">Johansen 1940</xref>). Images from slides were captured digitally through a Leica DMLB microscope with a video camera attached to a PC, using Leica IM50 image analysis software.Ten samples of each developmental stage of the flower buds and the petals were fixed in a Karnovsky solution adjusted to pH 7.2 using phosphate buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C31">Karnovsky 1965</xref>, modified), dehydrated using a series of graded ethyl alcohols (10, 30, 50, 70, 90 and 100 %), critical point-dried using CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C25">Horridge and Tamm 1969</xref>), mounted on aluminium stubs using double-sided carbon tape and coated with a 30â€“40 nm gold film. Images were captured using a LEO VP 435 scanning electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV.Volatile organic compounds of plants found in petals of sweet orange â€˜ValÃªnciaâ€™ were tested <italic>in vitro</italic> for antifungal activity against <italic>C. acutatum</italic>. Two compounds were selected according to the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C3">Attaway <italic>et al</italic>. (1966)</xref>: the R-limonene, 97 %, Sigma-Aldrich and linalool, 97 %, Sigma-Aldrich. R-limonene is one of the main components of essential citrus oils, the group of monoterpene hydrocarbons. Linalool is also found in essential oils from different citrus organs and belongs to the chemical group of monoterpene alcohols. Glass slides with doses of 1, 10, 100 and 1000 Âµg mL<sup>âˆ’1</sup> of active ingredient of each compound were placed on one side of the polystyrene plate. On the other side of the plate, the culture medium BDA was added and a disc of mycelium of 0.5 cm diameter of <italic>C. acutatum</italic> (isolate Ca142 of Fundecitrus collection) was added to the medium. Plates containing water blades with and without the compounds served as control. The plates were sealed with Parafilm and maintained in growth chambers at 25 Â°C. After 7 days, the diameter of the colony was measured. Growth inhibition was calculated and the values were used to estimate the EC<sub>50</sub> (effective concentration to reduce growth by 50 %) and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). The experiment was performed in triplicate with three replications; each plate was considered one repetition.Scanning electron micrographs (A, C, E, I), photomicrographs under non-polarized light (F, L) and polarized light (D, G, H, K) and photographs (B, Mâ€“Q) of flower buds of sweet orange (<italic>C. sinensis</italic> â€˜ValÃªnciaâ€™).

This grouping occurs near the apexes of the petal primordia. The crystals are also observed inside the cells surrounding substomatal chambers (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU090F1">1</xref>H).In the buds 8 mm long (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU090F1">1</xref>I and J) or longer (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU090F1">1</xref>M and N), petal primordia are exposed, distal papillate regions begin to separate (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU090F1">1</xref>K and L) and few CaO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> crystals are seen (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU090F1">1</xref>K).Flower buds up to 8 mm long have uniform distribution of oil glands (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU090F1">1</xref>J). However, as the flower buds develop, oil glands nearer the petal base spread, whereas oil glands at petal tips remain clustered (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU090F1">1</xref>M and N). This pattern continues in subsequent stages of flower development (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU090F1">1</xref>O and P). The flower buds expose only the abaxial face where oil glands are present. Anthesis exposes the adaxial petal surface, which is free of oil glands (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU090F1">1</xref>Q).Oil glands contain phenolic (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU090F2">2</xref>A) and lipophilic (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU090F2">2</xref>B) compounds. In flower buds 4 mm long, glands are concentrated near each other (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU090F2">2</xref>C), but become more spread out as petals enlarge in 8 mm- (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU090F2">2</xref>D) and 12-mm-long buds (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU090F2">2</xref>E). The distribution pattern of glands in buds 12 mm long is uneven, as most glands are observed near the apex of the petal primordia (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU090F2">2</xref>E).Scanning electron micrographs (A, B, F) and photomicrographs (Câ€“E, G, H) of osmophores in different developmental stages of flower buds of sweet orange (<italic>C. sinensis</italic> â€˜ValÃªnciaâ€™).

Dots represent the average of three experiments and three replicates for each rate.The anatomical analyses of the flower buds show structural characteristics that may explain the lower incidence of infection in buds smaller than 8 mm. The compact arrangement of papillae in the petal primordia in young flower buds could be considered a structural barrier to infection caused by <italic>C. acutatum</italic>. On the other hand, buds longer than 8 mm show loose arrangement, thus offering less resistance to the infection caused by this pathogen. These results corroborate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C21">Fagan (1979)</xref> in Belize, where flower rot symptoms were expressed only in flower buds during the expansion stage of the corolla and only in those buds longer than 8 mm. The author states that flower buds smaller than 8 mm may be more resistant to infection; however, susceptibility increases dramatically as the flower buds age, remaining high until anthesis.The lower infection rate of flower buds smaller than 8 mm caused by <italic>C. acutatum</italic> can also be associated with the presence of CaO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> crystals in the petal primordia. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C10">Ceita <italic>et al</italic>. (2007)</xref>, crystal degradation produces H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in specific points in the tissue and plays an important role in programmed cell death, acting effectively in pathogen control. The application of Ca in large quantities leads to the formation of intracellular CaO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C12">Choi <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C22">Faheed <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). There is a positive correlation between the Ca concentration provided to the plant and the number of crystals formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C60">Zindler-Frank <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>), as well as with their length and width (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C22">Faheed <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). Therefore, <italic>C. sinensis</italic> plants receiving high doses of Ca possibly show a large number of CaO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> crystals in flower buds and, consequently, are more resistant to infection caused by <italic>C. acutatum</italic>. Studies on nutrition based on different Ca sources could be conducted to further investigate this possibility.The occurrence of osmophores at the petal apexes, consisting of papillary cells and glandular trichomes, has not yet been documented for <italic>C. sinensis</italic>. These osmophores are morphologically similar to those described in some Orchidaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C46">Pridgeon and Stern 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C61">Pansarin <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C42">Melo <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>). In smaller flower buds, cells in the mesophyll of petal primordia accumulate starch in the early developmental stages of the osmophores. This accumulation may supply carbon for later production of VOCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C45">Pridgeon and Stern 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C54">Stern <italic>et al</italic>. 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C20">Effemert <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C32">Knudsen <italic>et al</italic>. (1993)</xref> the VOCs released by osmophores in 60 families of plants are: hydrocarbons, esters, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, terpenes, benzenoids, phenylpropanoids, isoprenoids and nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds. Among the terpenes, the mono- and sesquiterpenes stand out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C19">Dudareva and Pichersky 2000</xref>). The osmophores of <italic>C. sinensis</italic> produce and accumulate phenols, terpenes and lipophilic compounds in their cells (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU090F4">4</xref>). These substances have a recognized role as antifungal agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C7">Caccioni <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C36">Lattanzio <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>). In addition to their ecological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C47">Proctor <italic>et al</italic>. 1996</xref>), the compounds accumulated by osmophore cells may act as a constitutive chemical barrier. Further studies need to be conducted to identify the compounds secreted by <italic>C. sinensis</italic> osmophores.In flower buds smaller than 8 mm, oil glands are nearer to each other when compared with larger flower buds. The low incidence of lesions in flower buds smaller than 8 mm could possibly be linked to the concentrated oil glands, which may defend the tissues against pathogen attack. Essential oils of <italic>C. sinensis</italic> represent a constitutive defence against pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C7">Caccioni <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>). Some terpenes in citrus oil glands have been shown to inhibit bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C14">Dabbah <italic>et al</italic>. 1970</xref>) and fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C43">Moleyar and Narasimham 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C7">Caccioni <italic>et al</italic>. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C51">Sharma and Tripathi 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C56">Viuda-Martos <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>).Linalool is expressed in petals and in green and ripe fruit, while limonene appears mostly in ripe fruit. Linalool showed high antifungal activity against <italic>C. acutatum</italic> at doses higher than 100 Âµg mL<sup>âˆ’1</sup>; conversely, limonene showed low antifungal activity at 1000 Âµg mL<sup>âˆ’1</sup>. Linalool is usually the predominant VOC in flowers of different citrus species, mainly in sweet orange. However, there is a wide variation in concentration of this compound, from 22 to 52 % depending on the cultivar and the developmental stage of the flower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C2">Alissandrakis <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C27">Jabalpurwala <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C4">Azam <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). In tangerines, limonene and myrcene did not inhibit <italic>in vitro</italic> germination of conidia of <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic> at the dose of 130 Âµg mL<sup>âˆ’1</sup>. However, linalool showed an antifungal effect, inhibiting &gt;97 % of the germination of conidia by &gt;97 % at a similar dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C59">Yamasaki <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). In addition, limonene showed a stimulating effect on the germination of <italic>Penicillium digitatum</italic> and <italic>P. italicum</italic>, causal agents of mould in citrus fruits, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C18">Droby <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). The presence of alcoholic terpenes such as linalool in oil glands on petals of the ValÃªncia orange may be linked to the resistance of flower buds smaller than 8 mm. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the presence of limonene in flowers of <italic>C. sinensis</italic> is not associated with the mechanisms of resistance to infection caused by <italic>C. acutatum.</italic> Transformed orange plants that accumulated a smaller amount of limonene in the fruit peel have a higher resistance to fungus <italic>P. digitatum</italic> and bacterium <italic>Xanthomonas citri</italic> subsp. citri, causal agent of citrus canker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C49">Rodriguez <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>).The high susceptibility of the fully open flower to infection caused by <italic>C. acutatum</italic> may be related to structural features of the petal flower after opening that promote exposure of the adaxial face of the petal (which has no oil glands). In addition, this surface is composed of depressions and protrusions, which may facilitate the deposition of conidia and the formation of appressoria that occur preferentially along the anticline walls of epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU090C40">Marques <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). Petals could be more vulnerable to fungal infection because of softened cell walls (due to auxin-induced cell expansion). Ultrastructural studies of the parenchyma cell wall may contribute to better understanding of the vulnerability of the parenchyma cell to fungal infection.We conclude that the difference in response to infection caused by the fungus <italic>C. acutatum</italic> in flower buds of <italic>C. sinensis</italic> at different developmental stages may be linked to constitutive structural and biochemical barriers. The presence of CaO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> crystals, the pattern of papilla and the distribution, density and composition of citrus glands should be taken into consideration in further studies on disease control, once these constitutive natural defences are more evident in flower buds smaller than 8 mm in relation to flower buds longer than 8 mm, susceptible to the disease. For instance, spraying fungicides to control the disease can be delayed until the flower buds are longer than 8 mm. In addition, this study showed for the first time the site where synthesis and emission of volatiles occur in citrus petals. The site is characterized as an osmophore that produces and accumulates phenol, terpenes and lipophilic compounds. In addition, we demonstrate that alcoholic compounds such as monoterpenes present in citrus flowers have antifungal action against <italic>C. acutatum</italic> and may be associated with constitutive biochemical defences. These compounds have the potential to be used in further studies on chemical control of the pathogen or on genetic transformation and their overexpression in tissues.This work was supported by <grant-sponsor id="cs1" rid="cn1" xlink:type="simple">SÃ£o Paulo Research Foundation</grant-sponsor> (FAPESPâ€”projects <grant-num id="cn1" rid="cs1" xlink:type="simple">2008/541764, 2009/00425-6</grant-num>).J.P.R.M. conceived of the project, planned the research, carried out the techniques and drafted the manuscript.
