Mazama gouazoubira (Cervidae) diet during the dry season in the arid Chaco of CÃ³rdoba (Argentina).Grey brocket deer diet selection was studied during a period of water scarcity in the arid Chaco of COrdoba province, Argentina. Sampling took place during the dry season in and around Chancani Provincial Reserve (Pocho department). Forty-eight fresh fecal samples were collected from 85 sampling plots located at random. Plant cover and abundance were used to estimate food availability. Diet composition was determined using microscopic analysis of brocket feces and resource selection was calculated using Ivlev's Selectivity Index. Thirty-three plant species were identified in the diet. Fruits were found in high proportion (12.4%). Woody plants made up 67.7% of the diet; the most consumed species were Castela coccinea (23.1%), Maytenus spinosa (10.2%), Condalia microphylla (9.5%), Schinus fasciculatus (8.5%) and Ximena americana (7.4%). Mazama gouazoubira selects woody and succulent plants, while herbs are consumed according to availability and grasses in a proportion that is below what is available.
