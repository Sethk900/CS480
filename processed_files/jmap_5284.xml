The generic affiliation of Japanese species of the subfamily Psyllinae (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) with a revised checklistThe generic affiliations of all the Japanese species of the psyllid subfamily Psyllinae are re-examined under the current generic recognition of the subfamily based mainly on adult morphological characters. Twenty-two species of the genus Psylla Geoffroy are newly combined with the genus Cacopsylla Ossiannilsson. Psylla wulinensis Yang and Aphalara akebiae Shinji are newly synonymized with Psylla multipunctata Miyatake and Cacopsylla hakonensis (Kuwayama), respectively. In addition, Cacopsylla toddaliae (Yang) is newly recorded from Japan. In all, 62 species of the Japanese Psyllinae are recognized and classified into three genera Psylla, Cacopsylla and Chamaepsylla Ossiannilsson, which include 11, 50 and one species, respectively. A key to Japanese psylline genera and a revised checklist of all the Japanese species of Psyllinae are presented with their distribution and host plant information and also with their synonymies.
