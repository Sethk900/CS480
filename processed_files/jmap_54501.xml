A soil chronosequence in northwestern Italy: Morphological, physical and chemical characteristicsA chronosequence of soils developed on fluvial terraces dating from lower Middle Pleistocene to upper Upper Pleistocene was studied to identify the morphological, physical and chemical soil properties most sensitive to soil development and to further test the usefulness of iron oxides as indicators of relative age. A relative horizon distinctness (RHD) index and the Buntley-Westin and Hurst colour indices clearly reflected differences in soil development with age. Among physical characteristics, clay content and aggregation, obtained by comparison of clay dispersion before and after removal of cementing agents, were most efficient in indicating differences in duration of pedogenesis. Cation exchange capacity, as related to clay content, was the chemical property most useful to distinguish soils of different terraces. Iron-oxide ratios were again useful as indices of soil development.
