Palaeoecological analysis of a Late Quaternary sediment profile in northern Oman.High resolution palaeoecological studies of the Arabian Peninsula for the late Quaternary period are scarce. Consequently, little is known about time-dependent relationships between vegetation, environment and the development of human settlements in this area. To help fill this gap for the arid Hajar mountains of northern Oman, a 20 m deep profile in a sediment-filled depression near an oasis settlement was analysed for its physico-chemical properties, pollen and spores and other palynomorphs. Charcoal frequencies in combination with geochemical data provided evidence of an Early Holocene increase of rainfall. The onset of dryer conditions at about 8 ka was indicated by charcoal frequencies and geochemical data as were previously unrecognised short humid periods dated to 5.7, 5 and 4.4 ka. The upper 4 m of sediments contained a 4300 year-old pollen profile reaching into the archaeologically important Umm al-Nar period characterized by increased settlement activities throughout Oman. Variation in mollusc shell frequency and periodic peaks of NH4-N suggested only minor local variations of rainfall throughout the last 2000 years. The sudden appearance of Olea spec., Ziziphus and Fabaceae pollen since about 500 years ago points to a late onset of oasis agriculture nearby.
