Flexible responses of insects to changing environmental temperature - early season development of Craspedolepta species on fireweed.Developmental response to temperature during the critical early season growing period was investigated in two congeneric species of <em>Craspedolepta</em> feeding on <em>Epilobium angustifolium</em> at three sites at different altitudes in Norway and the UK. The larval development reaction norm to temperature, measured as accumulated day degrees, was not significantly different between <em>Craspedolepta nebulosa</em> and <em>Craspedolepta subpunctata</em> at sites where they co-occurred but <em>C. nebulosa</em> development was consistently more advanced at any site. For individual species the reaction norms at the lowest site (Ainsdale, UK) were similar to the intermediate site (Geilo, Norway): and there were no differences between years. Insect size remained relatively constant. However, at the highest site (Haugast&oslash;l, Norway), where <em>C. subpunctata</em> is unable to complete its development, the reaction norm for <em>C. nebulosa</em> was significantly higher than at Geilo and the individual insects produced were smaller. These adaptations allow life-history completion under limiting temperature conditions. An experiment at Ainsdale, to raise the mean temperature by around 2.5Â°C during the early growing season, resulted in accelerated development in both <em>C. nebulosa</em> and <em>C. subpunctata</em> but development in <em>C. nebulosa</em> was accelerated proportionately more. <em>C. nebulosa</em> thus displays the greater plasticity in developmental response to environmental temperature that allows it to occupy a greater altitudinal and latitudinal range than <em>C. subpunctata</em>, in which the response is less plastic and more canalized. The likely individualistic responses of the two species to climate warming are considered.
