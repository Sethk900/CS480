Apparatus for non-destructive measurement of grapevine trunk cross-sectional areaMeasuring sap flow in grapevine trunks, using the heat pulse velocity technique, requires accurate, non-destructive measurement of trunk cross-sectional areas. A profile measuring apparatus (PMA) was constructed to improve the accuracy of these measurements, particularly for irregular cross-sections. The low-cost PMA provided accurate, non-destructive measurements of grapevine trunk cross-sectional areas when compared to actual areas. Trunk cross-sectional areas estimated from diameter or circumference measurements proved to be less accurate than those obtained using the PMA. Results showed that estimated areas could result in large errors in the case of thick (greater than 30 cm2), irregular trunks.
