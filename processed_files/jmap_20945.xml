A new species of the genus Himertosoma from the Ryukyus, Japan, with a key to species from the Palaearctic and Oriental Regions (Hymenoptera,Â Ichneumonidae, Banchinae)Abstract A new species of the genus Himertosoma Schmiedeknecht, Himertosoma kuslitzkii sp. n., was discovered in Amamioshima Island, the Ryukyus. This new species resembles two Oriental species, Himertosoma philippense Chandra & Gupta and Himertosoma townesi Chandra & Gupta, in the colour pattern of the head and metasoma, number of flagellomeres, and the relatively slender first metasomal tergite, but can easily be distinguished from them by the nearly evenly punctate propodeum, different length/width ratio of the first metasomal tergite, different length of the ovipositor sheath, tricoloured mesosoma, and the whitish band along the posterior margin of the second and following metasomal tergites. A key to the Palaearctic and Oriental species of Himertosoma is also provided.
