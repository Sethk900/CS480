Abundance, Habitat Use and Conservation of the Olingo Bassaricyon sp. in Marac√° Ecological Station, Roraima, Brazilian AmazoniaWe censused olingos (Bassaricyon sp., Carnivora, Procyonidae) in a seasonally-dry forest in four habitats along a 5 km trail, in the northern Brazilian Amazonia. Data were collected on density, the use of the forest types and strata, and biomass was estimated. We interviewed local people and professionals in environmental organisations in order to assess the olingo's conservation status. Olingos, which occurred at very high densities (about 11 groups, or 20 individuals/km 2), were recorded in groups of up to six animals; they ate fruit, and appeared to be high- canopy dwellers.
