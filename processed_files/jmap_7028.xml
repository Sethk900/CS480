Aphid parasitoid fauna (Hymenoptera, Aphidiidae) of the Southern Beech (Nothofagus) forestAphid parasitoid fauna of the Nothofagus forests (Chile) consists of two groups: One is formed by several species of Pseudephedrus Stary that are parasitoids of Neuquenaphis aphids associated with various Nothofagus species. The other group includes a number of parasitoid species that may occur in the forest undergrowth and ecotones, but their aphidâ€parasitoid associations are prevalently outside of the forest. The parasitoidâ€host associations and derived ecosystem relationships of both groups are reviewed. New parasitoid species, Pseudephedrus andensis sp. n. (from Neuquenaphis palliceps H.R.L. on Nothofagus dombeyi) and P. longivalvus sp.n. (from Neuquenaphis staryi Q. & R. on Nothofagus alessandri) are described. The parasitoid complex associated with Nothofagus forests is wellâ€defined and typical of the Nothofagus area; the only faunal (known) connection outside the area is with the tropical cloud forest through P. neotropicalis Stary, a parasitoid of Neolizerius acunai Holman (Lizerini) associated with some Lauraceae (Cuba). The endemic Nothofagus â€ aphid â€ parasitoid associations were found not to be affected by any of the parasitoid biocontrol agents introduced into Chile against various aphid pests.
