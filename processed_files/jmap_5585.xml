Genetic diversity of Atherina hepsetus (Osteichthyes: Atherinidae) populations as determined by RFLP analysis of three mtDNA regionsThe genetic differentiation of 11 Greek Atherina hepsetus populations have been investigated at the mtDNA level. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of three mtDNA regions (12S rRNA, 16S rRNA and Dâ€loop) amplified by PCR was used. Eighteen restriction endonucleases were found to have at least one recognition site at the three mtDNA regions studied. Fifteen different composite haplotypes were detected among the populations studied while 80.6% of the individuals were grouped in two common haplotypes. The estimated net nucleotide sequence divergence values between the populations ranged from 0.003 to 0.379%, while the Nst value of 0.092 indicates the existence of low interpopulation genetic differentiation. The findings clearly support the existence of a single panmictic population in the sampling area.
