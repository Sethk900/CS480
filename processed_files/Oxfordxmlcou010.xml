We found that stress and reproductive hormones in grizzly and black bears varied with salmon availability and consumption by bears but patterns differed between species. On-going salmon declines might affect bears via nutritional and social stress.Food availability can influence the nutritional and social dynamics within and among species. Our investigation focused on grizzly and black bears in coastal British Columbia, Canada, where recent and dramatic declines in their primary prey (salmon) raise concerns about potentially negative effects on bear physiology. We examined how salmon availability relates to stress and reproductive hormones in coastal grizzly (<italic>n</italic>â€…=â€…69) and black bears (<italic>n</italic>â€…=â€…68) using cortisol and testosterone. In hair samples from genotyped individuals, we quantified salmon consumption using stable isotope analysis and hormone levels by enzyme immunoassay. To estimate the salmon biomass available to each bear, we developed a spatially explicit approach based on typical bear home-range sizes. Next, we compared the relative importance of salmon consumption and salmon availability on hormone levels in male bears using an information theoretical approach. Cortisol in grizzly bears was higher in individuals that consumed less salmon, possibly reflecting nutritional stress. In black bears, cortisol was better predicted by salmon availability than salmon consumption; specifically, individuals in areas and years with low salmon availability showed higher cortisol levels. This indicates that cortisol in black bears is more strongly influenced by the socially competitive environment mediated by salmon availability than by nutritional requirements. In both species, testosterone generally decreased with increasing salmon availability, possibly reflecting a less competitive environment when salmon were abundant. Differences between species could relate to different nutritional requirements, social densities and competitive behaviour and/or habitat use. We present a conceptual model to inform further investigations in this and other systems. Our approach, which combines data on multiple hormones with dietary and spatial information corresponding to the year of hair growth, provides a promising tool for evaluating the responses of a broad spectrum of wildlife to changes in food availability or other environmental conditions.Resource availability can affect animal physiology via complex interactions among nutritional, ecological and social conditions. Notably, the abundance, distribution and quality of resources mediate energy gain, behaviour and social dynamics within and among species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C46">Koenig and Borries, 2006</xref>). Moreover, nutritious resources that are clumped or easy to monopolize are expected to increase competition and can lead to rank-related differences in energy gains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C40">Janson and van Schaik, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C90">van Schaik, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C28">Gende and Quinn, 2004</xref>). Accordingly, understanding how organisms respond physiologically to the abundance and distribution of resources could provide insight into the social and nutritional consequences of changes in food availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C94">Wikelski and Cooke, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C38">Hofer and East, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C86">Seebacher and Franklin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C15">Cooke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C19">Dantzer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).Stress and reproductive hormones are well suited for studies of wildlife ecophysiology. Specifically, the glucocorticoid steroid hormone, cortisol, is a general indicator of physiological responses to variation in internal or external conditions, including social challenges (i.e. allostatic load; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C83">Sapolsky <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C80">Romero, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C76">Reeder and Kramer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C18">Creel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). The androgen, testosterone, which may reflect male reproductive investment and activity during the breeding season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C43">Kempenaers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), also can be modulated by social challenges, such as those that occur over access to mates or fitness-enhancing resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C96">Wingfield <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C65">Oliveira, 2004</xref>). Both hormones can be measured in hair, which is thought to primarily reflect chronic hormone levels integrated over the period of hair growth (i.e. several months to years, depending on population-specific patterns of hair growth; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C47">Koren <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C51">Macbeth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C61">Meyer and Novak, 2012</xref>). Steroid hormones are incorporated into hair via one or more mechanisms, including diffusion from the blood vessel that feeds the hair follicle, local synthesis of steroids by the hair follicle, and secretion from sebaceous and eccrine glands surrounding hair follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C71">Pragst and Balikova, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C42">Keckeis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C61">Meyer and Novak, 2012</xref>). A number of recent studies have demonstrated that hormonal measurements of hair reflect biologically meaningful endocrine activity in wildlife (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C61">Meyer and Novak, 2012</xref>), including bears (<italic>Ursus</italic> spp.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C51">Macbeth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C52">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C10">Bourbonnais <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C12">Bryan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C58">Malcolm <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).In areas of North America where they still co-occur, coastal populations of grizzly (<italic>Ursus arctos</italic>) and black bears (<italic>Ursus americanus</italic>) have co-evolved with spawning Pacific salmon (<italic>Oncorhynchus</italic> spp.) as a nutritious but spatially and temporally constrained food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C39">Jacoby <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C77">Reimchen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C20">Darimont <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C50">Levi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). The fat and protein from salmon come at a critical time for bears before hibernation; pre-denning fat stores are positively correlated with the reproductive success of females the following year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C37">Hilderbrand <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C6">Belant <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). In these systems, body size is a strong predictor of reproductive success (determined by paternity and encounters with females) in male grizzly and black bears, suggesting that eating salmon is related to male fitness in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C49">Kovach and Powell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C97">Zedrosser <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C16">Costello <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).In addition to being an important food, seasonal salmon availability influences inter- and intra-population dynamics in bears. Although typically solitary, bears cluster on salmon streams when salmon become available, leading to increased potential for direct or indirect social encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C22">Egbert and Stokes, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C79">Rogers, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C17">Craighead <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). Feeding aggregations often lead to establishment of social hierarchies where bears may be tolerant or extremely aggressive towards other bears, depending at least in part on availability and spatial configuration of food resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C34">Herrero, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C79">Rogers, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C28">Gende and Quinn, 2004</xref>). Physical encounters at food sources can lead to injury or death, especially of juveniles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C79">Rogers, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C60">Mattson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C59">Mattson and Reinhart, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C8">Ben-David <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Between species, grizzly bears tend to dominate salmon spawning streams, with black bears using alternative food sources, fishing sites or times of day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C55">Machutchon <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C6">Belant <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C26">Fortin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C85">Schwartz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Within species there may also be a dominance hierarchy, with some individuals being excluded from prime fishing areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C28">Gende and Quinn, 2004</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C29">Gill and Helfield, 2012</xref>).Several studies have linked food availability with cortisol in bears. Specifically, cortisol in serum is typically elevated during hibernation when bears do not eat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C32">Harlow <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C33">Hellgren <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). Moreover, cortisol metabolites in faeces were elevated in grizzly and black bears that ate foods of low nutritional quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C91">Wasser <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C88">Stetz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). In hair, higher cortisol was associated with lower salmon consumption by grizzly bears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C12">Bryan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013b</xref>) and poorer body condition in polar bears (<italic>Ursus maritimis</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C52">Macbeth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). In addition, human landscape disturbance also affects cortisol levels in grizzly bear hair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C10">Bourbonnais <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). In serum of male bears, testosterone rises during the breeding season (typically Mayâ€“July) and remains relatively low during other parts of the year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C57">McMillin <italic>et al.</italic>, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C67">Palmer <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C93">White <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Annual patterns in testosterone are thought to be regulated largely by photoperiod; however, social conditions can also influence testosterone in bears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C27">Garshelis and Hellgren, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C12">Bryan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013b</xref>).Main hypotheses tested and associated predictions examining the effects of salmon consumption and availability on cortisol and testosterone in grizzly and black bears<sup>a</sup>We considered an hypothesis to be supported if the predictor of interest was included in the top model set and showed a significant trend in the predicted direction, partly supported if the predictor was included in the top model set but was not significant, and not supported if the predictor did not occur in the top model set or was opposite to our prediction. <sup>b</sup>Salmon consumption provides an estimate of a bear's yearly protein assimilation from salmon and is derived from stable isotope analysis of hair samples genetically linked to individual bears in each year. <sup>c</sup>Salmon availability is a measure of the salmon biomass available to a bear in a given year relative to the average salmon biomass in that bear's home range. The metric was derived from a principal components analysis. <sup>d</sup>Watershed productivity is a measure of average salmon biomass available within each bear's home range. <sup>e</sup>Testosterone might be linked positively or negatively with traits such as age, body size and social rank, depending on the nature of social interactions and stability of the dominance hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C82">Sapolsky, 1993</xref>).We also tested a working hypothesis that testosterone would be influenced by social density, which is mediated by salmon availability among coastal bears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C36">Hilderbrand <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Specifically, higher social density might lead to more intense competition for mates or other fitness-enhancing resources (such as salmon) and consequently, higher testosterone. This hypothesis was premised on our previous finding that testosterone was higher in coastal bears with access to salmon compared with interior bears without access to salmon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C12">Bryan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013b</xref>). Accordingly, we investigated whether testosterone varied in relationship to salmon availability within coastal populations. We specifically evaluated the relative importance of two possible mechanisms by which salmon availability might influence testosterone. Based on the established positive relationship between bear population densities and salmon availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C36">Hilderbrand <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>), we first predicted that areas with higher average salmon biomass (i.e. â€˜watershed productivityâ€™) would support more bears, possibly reflecting or promoting a more competitive social environment (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COU010TB1">1</xref>, Hypothesis C). Second, we tested whether testosterone varied with salmon availability, estimated for individual bears based on year and location of capture and standardized relative to the average salmon biomass for a given watershed (i.e. â€˜salmon availabilityâ€™). This allowed us to investigate whether testosterone levels might be modulated specifically by competition for salmon (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COU010TB1">1</xref>, Hypothesis D). In addition, we estimated the relative density of bears across regions of our study area using bears detected at hair-snagging stations. This allowed us to test whether hormone levels are influenced by variables related to bear social density, such as access to mates, independent of salmon abundance. To differentiate among these measured components of the social and ecological environments, we referred to average salmon biomass as â€˜watershed productivityâ€™, salmon biomass available to bears when sampled hair was grown as â€˜salmon availabilityâ€™, and density estimates from our grid-based study area as â€˜bear densityâ€™. Finally, we tested hypotheses relating testosterone to salmon consumption, which could be driven by individual traits, such as age, social rank and body size, and/or by social conditions mediated by salmon availability (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COU010TB1">1</xref>, Hypothesis E).Our study area and sample collection protocol followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C12">Bryan <italic>et al.</italic> (2013b)</xref>. Briefly, we collected hair samples from black and grizzly bears on the central coast of British Columbia in May and June of 2009â€“2011. We divided our study area into a regular grid of square cells, within which we place barbed wire fences (i.e. hair snags) for hair collection following standard protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C44">Kendall <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C74">Proctor <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). During our 2009 pilot year, we sampled from 92 5â€…kmâ€…Ã—â€…5â€…km grid cells over âˆ¼2500â€…km<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C2">2</xref></sup>, and in 2010 and 2011 we sampled from 71 7â€…kmâ€…Ã—â€…7â€…km grid cells over âˆ¼5000â€…km<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C2">2</xref></sup>. We checked the snags and collected hair twice in each year at intervals of 10â€“14â€…days. Snags were disassembled between consecutive years. This âˆ¼4â€…week collection period occurs during the shedding phases of the annual moult. Accordingly, we assumed that hair samples represent diet and hormones assimilated in the previous year during the hair growth stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C35">Hilderbrand <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C84">Schwartz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C41">Jones <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Additional spring hair samples from grizzly bears, obtained from the BC provincial government between 2004 and 2010, were originally collected via compulsory inspection of remains from grizzly bears hunted in coastal BC. Samples were collected under approved animal care protocols at the Universities of Santa Cruz (WILMc0904) and Calgary (BI10R-01). In addition, we obtained permission from the Heiltsuk Integrated Resource Management Department on behalf of the Heiltsuk Nation and BC Parks (Park Use Permit Number 103586).Samples used in analysesHair samples were collected from grizzly and black bears from coastal British Columbia, Canada. Sample sizes represent hair from unique individuals collected in spring of a particular year. Hair samples collected from the same individual during one 4â€…week sampling period during the annual moult were pooled because they reflect diet and hormone levels in hair grown during the previous year. Recaptures are individuals detected in more than 1â€…year of the study. <sup>a</sup>Results from six separate model selections are presented for male grizzly and black bears (Tables 3 and 4 and Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU010F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU010F4">4</xref>). <sup>b</sup>Only male bears were included in model selection because of the small sample size for female bears. <sup>c</sup>Model sets excluding one recapture gave similar results to those including both recaptures; recaptured bears were retained in analyses.We obtained data on numbers of spawning salmon in coastal BC from Fisheries and Oceans Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C25">FOC, 2012</xref>). This database contains yearly abundance estimates of the five Pacific salmon species over 60â€…years in &gt;6000 watersheds in coastal BC; however, âˆ¼30% of species estimates from streams that are monitored regularly are missing, making comparisons over space and time inconsistent for our desired scale of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C73">Price <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Consequently, we developed an imputation method for missing data points (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/conphys/cou010/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary material, Table S1</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C81">Ruggerone <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Validations revealed adequate agreement between imputed and existing salmon abundance estimates, with a mean coefficient of variability of 12.2% on log-transformed data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/conphys/cou010/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary material, Fig. S1</ext-link>). We then calculated salmon biomass in each watershed by multiplying abundance estimates by the average mass of salmon (in kilograms) and summing across species. We used measurements made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C30">Groot and Margolis (1991)</xref>, which are based on average mass of both sexes and assume a 1:1 sex ratio. We then divided salmon biomass by the length of the spawning area at each stream to obtain a measure of biomass per stream length for use in further calculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C3">BCGOV, 2006</xref>).We estimated salmon biomass available to each bear by placing a buffer around each location where bears were detected, and calculated the spawning salmon biomass within the buffer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/conphys/cou010/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary material, Figs S1, S2, and S3</ext-link>). Given that most bears were detected only once (<italic>n</italic>â€…=â€…50 of 59 black bears and <italic>n</italic>â€…=â€…22 of 27 grizzly bears), we were not able to calculate home ranges individually for each bear. Consequently, we based buffer sizes for each species and sex on the largest home-range estimates calculated using the 100% minimum convex polygon method in available studies of coastal bears (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/conphys/cou010/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary material, Fig. S3 and Table S2</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C54">Machutchon <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; H. Davis, unpublished data). We generated a regular grid of 40 candidate buffers for each bear because our detection locations could have occurred anywhere within a bear's home range. We then selected the buffer containing the highest total salmon biomass, based on average biomass in the last 10â€…years, assuming that bears would maximize their access to this fitness-enhancing resource. Likewise, for bears detected at multiple locations within the same year, we selected the location with the highest salmon biomass. Using the buffer containing the maximum 10â€…year average biomass, we calculated salmon biomass in the year of hair growth and the year before hair growth. Notably, salmon availability can be affected by many factors, such as water levels, the configuration of fishing sites, the diversity of salmon species present and social interactions. For our purposes, we considered our measure of salmon abundance as the only component of availability.All analyses were carried out using R statistical software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C75">R Development Core Team, 2011</xref>). Variables relating to hormone levels, salmon abundance and salmon consumption were not normally distributed, and the two species showed different degrees of skewness. Consequently, we used non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum tests to compare the distributions of salmon consumption, cortisol and testosterone between species and sexes. To control for the number of comparisons, we adjusted <italic>P</italic>â€…values using a Holmâ€“Bonferroni correction factor.In our subsequent model selection approach, we focused only on males, because of the small sample size for female grizzly (<italic>n</italic>â€…=â€…14) and black bears (<italic>n</italic>â€…=â€…9; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COU010TB2">2</xref>). Our data analysis protocol generally followed that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C98">Zuur <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)</xref>. Initial descriptive analyses included examining variables for evidence of collinearity using pairwise correlation coefficients and variance inflation factors. Salmon biomass variables were collinear, so we used a principal components analysis on log-transformed variables to allow examination of both watershed productivity and salmon availability (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/conphys/cou010/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary material, Fig. S4 and Table S3</ext-link>). The salmon consumption variable for grizzly bears was highly left skewed, with most bears eating high proportions of salmon. Accordingly, we applied an arcsine transformation of salmon consumption, which improved normality of residuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C53">McCune <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Cortisol and testosterone concentrations were highly right skewed, with most individuals having low concentrations of both steroids. To improve normality of residuals, a natural log transformation was adequate for black bear cortisol and testosterone. In grizzly bears, the distribution was more highly skewed, and a stronger, negative reciprocal transformation improved the normality of residuals. Four grizzly bear samples and one black bear sample had extreme values for cortisol or testosterone (&gt;2â€…SD from the mean) and were not included in the analysis. An explanation for excluding these outliers and potential effects of doing so is provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C12">Bryan <italic>et al.</italic> (2013b)</xref>. All variables were standardized before analysis to a mean of zero and standard deviation of one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C98">Zuur <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).To address our specific hypotheses (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COU010TB1">1</xref>), we developed sets of <italic>a priori</italic> candidate models describing testosterone and cortisol and grouped models into three categories (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/conphys/cou010/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary material, Tables S4â€“S9</ext-link>). In the first group, we examined the relative importance of different environmental variables (watershed productivity, salmon availability, year and bear density). In the second group, we evaluated the most important individual variables (salmon consumption or hormone levels). Specifically, we predicted that cortisol and testosteroneâ€”both of which can influence or be affected by social interactionsâ€”should be associated positively except when nutritional stress becomes a more important modulator of cortisol than social stress. Finally, the third group of models investigated whether a combination of environmental factors, individual factors and their interactions are associated with cortisol and testosterone levels. To determine the relative importance of individual and environmental variables, we compared the top models from each group and identified associated parameters with most predictive utility.We used multiple linear regression and Akaike's information criterion, corrected for small sample size (AICc), to rank candidate models within and among <italic>a priori</italic> hypotheses. The weight of evidence for individual models was calculated based on AICc scores of all models considered for each comparison. In competing top models (Î”AICcâ€…&lt;â€…2) from each group, model weights were calculated relative to the top model from each group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C1">Anderson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). We evaluated the adequacy of top models based on normality of residuals and plots of residuals vs. predicted values and residuals vs. each predictor variable (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/conphys/cou010/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary material, Figs S5 and S6</ext-link>). We examined Cook's distance as an indicator of influential observations. To improve comparisons between species, we performed the analysis twice for grizzly bears, once on individual bears sampled over 8â€…years (<italic>n</italic>â€…=â€…54) at a larger spatial scale and once on a subset of individuals collected between 2008 and 2010 (<italic>n</italic>â€…=â€…27) at a smaller spatial scale (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COU010TB2">2</xref>). We also performed the analyses on subsets of the data excluding individuals detected in multiple years (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COU010TB2">2</xref>). Including individual as a random intercept term in the models was not possible, because only five bears were captured more than once. Randomly excluding data from one of the captures had little effect on our interpretation, so we treated bears captured in more than 1â€…year as independent cases in the analyses presented below.Salmon availability and consumption in male grizzly and black bears from coastal British Columbia. (<bold>A</bold>) Spawning salmon biomass (in kilograms) in the estimated home ranges of both species has generally decreased over the last decade, with an exception in 2009.

Other analyses were performed on grizzly bear data in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C12">Bryan <italic>et al.</italic> (2013b)</xref>.Species and sexes showed notably different hormone levels.

Year was the most important predictor of black bear cortisol and showed a similar trend to that in grizzly bears, with cortisol being higher in 2009 and lower in 2010 relative to 2008 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COU010TB4">4</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU010F3">3</xref>D). Cortisol decreased with salmon availability (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU010F3">3</xref>B) and increased with testosterone (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COU010TB4">4</xref>). Cortisol was marginally higher in areas with higher black bear density compared with areas of lower black bear density (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COU010TB4">4</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU010F3">3</xref>F).

(<bold>A</bold>) In grizzly bears, testosterone generally decreased with increasing salmon availability in productive and less productive watersheds; however, two bears with low testosterone and low salmon availability appeared to drive a modest positive trend in watersheds with low productivity. (<bold>B</bold>) In black bears, testosterone increased with increasing watershed productivity. (<bold>C</bold>) In grizzly bears, a lack of data on bears with low salmon consumption and high salmon availability caused an interaction between the two variables. (<bold>D</bold>) In black bears, testosterone decreased with increasing salmon consumption. (<bold>E</bold> and <bold>F</bold>) Testosterone and cortisol were positively associated in both grizzly and black bears; however, the strength of the association varied with salmon availability. Relationships were predicted from the top model for each species. Other terms in the model were held constant at their mean. Interacting terms were split into high or low at their mean values. All models were fitted on variables standardized and transformed (see Materials and methods). Other analyses were performed on grizzly bear data in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C12">Bryan <italic>et al.</italic> (2013b)</xref>.Male grizzly bears that consumed high amounts of salmon had lower testosterone when salmon availability was high compared with when salmon availability was low. Other analyses were performed on these data in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C12">Bryan <italic>et al.</italic> (2013b)</xref>.As with grizzly bears, testosterone in male black bears was predicted by both individual and environmental variables (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COU010TB3">3</xref>). In addition, in a similar manner to grizzly bears, testosterone in black bears decreased with salmon availability and increased with cortisol (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COU010TB5">5</xref>). However, a non-significant interaction term (<italic>P</italic>â€…=â€…0.15) suggested that the relationship between testosterone and cortisol was stronger when salmon availability was low, which was opposite to the trend in grizzly bears (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU010F4">4</xref>E and F). Moreover, black bear testosterone increased more strongly with watershed productivity compared with grizzly bears (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COU010TB5">5</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU010F4">4</xref>B). The amount of salmon consumed was also included in the top model set; black bears with higher testosterone consumed less salmon (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COU010TB5">5</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU010F4">4</xref>D).Conceptual model describing how salmon availability might affect social and nutritional stress in coastal grizzly bears and black bears. For simplicity, we assume a population with stable density where salmon availability varies on a yearly basis from low to super-abundant relative to the number of bears. Furthermore, we assume that cortisol represents either social or nutritional stress and that testosterone reflects social stress (i.e. stress due to social conditions). Although many other variables affect testosterone and cortisol, we focus here on the relationship with salmon availability. (<bold>A</bold>) When salmon availability is low (at symbol â€˜aâ€™), nutritional stress would be high and social density would be low because bears would use other, more dispersed, resources or move elsewhere to access salmon. When salmon availability is intermediate relative to the number of bears, competition would be high and nutritional stress would be intermediate (symbol â€˜bâ€™). Both social and nutritional stress would be low when enough salmon is available that most bears meet their nutritional requirements (symbol â€˜câ€™). We suggest that variations in this model could explain the differences we observed between grizzly and black bears as follows: grizzly and black bears might have different nutritional requirements (<bold>B</bold>), population densities (<bold>C</bold>) or habitat and resource use (<bold>D</bold>). We note that no single model completely explains our data; combinations of these models plus other factors described in the text are probably important.We hypothesized that cortisol in grizzly bears would increase with decreasing salmon consumption via the following two possible mechanisms: (i) bears that consume less salmon would be nutritionally stressed (an individual variable); and/or (ii) bears experience increased social stress when salmon are less abundant (an environmental variable). Our model selection approach showed that the amount of salmon that grizzly bears consumedâ€”a direct measure of a bear's nutritional contextâ€”better predicts cortisol than salmon availability and watershed productivity, which would affect the number of bears present and the type of intra-specific interactions. These findings support our nutritional hypothesis and are consistent with studies attributing elevated cortisol to nutritional stress in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C33">Hellgren <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C45">Kitaysky <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C5">Behie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C2">Ayres <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Notably, elevated cortisol could be an adaptive response to food shortages by mobilizing fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C32">Harlow <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>), by promoting bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C21">Donahue <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) or by influencing food-seeking behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C70">Pfeffer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C78">Reneerkens <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C72">Pravosudov, 2003</xref>) and appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C23">Epel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>).In contrast to grizzly bears, cortisol in black bears was more strongly predicted by salmon availability than salmon consumption; cortisol was lower when more salmon were available. These findings indicate that cortisol in black bears is influenced more strongly by the social environment mediated by yearly trends in salmon abundance than by the nutritional context alone. Social stress in black bears would occur if lower salmon availability leads to increased real or perceived competition over access to salmon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C19">Dantzer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Although not significant, higher cortisol levels in areas with higher black bear densityâ€”where social density would be higherâ€”support this explanation. Interestingly, grizzly bears also had higher cortisol in areas with higher black bear density, which could relate to inter-specific interactions or to habitat differences in areas with higher black bear densities. Among grizzly bears, salmon availability was lower in areas with higher black bear densities, supporting this latter possibility.Although grizzly and black bears showed different trends in relationship to salmon consumption and availability, both had a similar pattern over time, with higher cortisol after years of low salmon abundance compared with a year of very abundant salmon. Based on our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C12">Bryan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013b</xref>), we hypothesized that the cortisol differences among years in grizzly bears related to salmon consumption in the previous year. If bears consumed less salmon when less was available in 2007 and 2008, they would have entered hibernation in poorer body condition compared with 2009, which would lead to higher nutritional stress in 2008 and 2009. Changes in salmon consumption over time support this explanation in grizzly bears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C12">Bryan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013b</xref>); however, diet in black bears changed little among years, providing further evidence that different factors influence cortisol in black bears.Several possibilities could explain the differences we observed between grizzly and black bears. Black bears, which are smaller than grizzly bears, might be better able to meet their energetic requirements from plant-based diets alone and would therefore be less likely to experience nutritional stress (cortisol) due to lower salmon consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C92">Welch <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C7">Belant <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C56">McLellan, 2011</xref>). We present this option in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU010F6">6</xref>B; however, this is unlikely to be the only explanation, because like grizzly bears, black bears can gain energy much more efficiently on a diet of salmon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C92">Welch <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). Moreover, where the two species are allopatric, black and grizzly bears eat similar amounts of salmon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C39">Jacoby <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). A more likely explanation for the differences between species is higher social density in black relative to grizzly bears (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU010F6">6</xref>C). We detected more than twice as many black as grizzly bears in our grid-based study area, a pattern predicted by known differences in densities of both species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C62">Miller <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>).Social stress in black bears could also be more pronounced because of inter-specific interactions with grizzly bears (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU010F6">6</xref>D). Grizzly bears have a competitive advantage due to their larger body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C39">Jacoby <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C6">Belant <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C7">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C26">Fortin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) and occasionally prey on black bears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C60">Mattson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C31">Gunther <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). To avoid encountering grizzly bears, black bears often use alternative foraging locations or times of day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C55">Machutchon <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C6">Belant <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C26">Fortin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C85">Schwartz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). If these alternative foraging strategies are less profitable or if fishing sites are easier to monopolize, black bears would experience more intense intra-specific social stress related to accessing salmon. Lower salmon consumption among black than grizzly bears supports this possibility. Moreover, black bears might risk exposure to grizzly bears when habitat quality is extremely high (e.g. where salmon is available), which could lead to stress levels induced by fear of predation or interference competition with grizzly bears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C14">Clinchy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Although grizzly bear density was not an important predictor of cortisol in black bears, our density estimates were averaged over space and time and might not reflect densities on salmon spawning streams (see Marerials and methods).Patterns in testosterone are consistent with higher social density and/or reproductive activity in black relative to grizzly bears. In grizzly bears, coastal individuals had higher testosterone than non-salmon-eating individuals from the interior, which we attributed to higher social density mediated by salmon availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C12">Bryan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013b</xref>). Between species, black bears had higher testosterone than grizzly bears. We posit that, similar to density-related testosterone differences among grizzly populations, higher densities or higher reproductive activity in black relative to grizzly bears might explain this trend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C95">Wingfield <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C96">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C65">Oliveira, 2004</xref>). However, more data are warranted on testosterone levels to determine whether inter-specific patterns could be due to different baseline concentrations, hair structure or reproductive cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C67">Palmer <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C27">Garshelis and Hellgren, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C93">White <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Surprisingly, male bears did not have higher hair testosterone than females in either bear species, probably because of the small sample size for females and our lack of data on age and reproductive status. Moreover, hair reflects testosterone integrated over the breeding and non-breeding seasons in males, when testosterone levels vary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C27">Garshelis and Hellgren, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C93">White <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), as well as the delayed implantation stage of pregnancy in females, when corpora lutea are capable of producing androgens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C89">Tsubota <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>). Differences in testosterone between sexes might therefore be less distinct in hair than in samples collected at a single time point, such as serum (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C12">Bryan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013b</xref>).Within bear species, we used a model selection approach to explore whether testosterone levels varied in relationship to watershed productivity. In particular, we hypothesized that testosterone would increase with watershed productivity, which might reflect higher bear social density or higher reproductive activity in watersheds where more salmon, on average, is available. Consistent with our prediction, testosterone increased with watershed productivity in black bears. In contrast, there was little evidence that testosterone in grizzly bears increased with watershed productivity; possibly because grizzly population density is generally low or grizzly bears consistently occupy productive watersheds where important resources, such as salmon, are sufficiently abundant that bears do not have to compete over them.We also investigated whether testosterone varied in relationship to salmon availability, which would suggest that elevated testosterone is related to competition for salmon. Based on an established link between fitness and salmon consumption, combined with strong competition observed among bears at spawning salmon streams, we hypothesized that yearly changes in salmon availability would affect the social environment, leading to changes in testosterone. Consistent with our prediction, both bear species showed lower testosterone when more salmon was available, probably reflecting a less competitive social environment when salmon numbers were above average (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU010F6">6</xref>).In addition to the environmental variables described above, testosterone was related to individual variables (salmon consumption and cortisol) in both species. We did not detect a positive association between testosterone and salmon consumption in either species, a relationship that would occur if salmon consumption relates to reproductive activity or if bears with high testosterone are more likely to consume salmon. This result, however, must be interpreted with caution for several reasons. First, we did not have data to control for effects of age, social rank, body size or reproductive activity, all of which would be related to salmon consumption and testosterone. Second, our measure of testosterone in hair is integrated over the breeding and non-breeding period in males and might therefore mask trends related directly to reproductive activity. Finally, the majority of salmon consumption would occur after the breeding season in bears; consequently, measuring salmon consumption in longitudinal hair samples collected from the same individuals in different years would provide a better understanding of the timing of any effect of salmon consumption on reproductive activity.Notably, model selection revealed that testosterone was lower among bears that consumed more salmon in both species. This trend would occur if testosterone levels are lowered by environmental contaminants found in salmon, an effect detected in polar bears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C66">Oskam <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Indeed, coastal salmon-consuming grizzly bears have higher levels of persistent organic pollutants than grizzly bears that do not consume salmon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C13">Christensen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). However, we found previously that testosterone was higher in coastal salmon-consuming grizzly bears than in a grizzly population that does not consume salmon, suggesting that salmon consumption does not decrease testosterone overall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C12">Bryan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013b</xref>). Moreover, the trend was weaker in grizzly bears than in black bears, even though grizzly bears consumed more salmon. Alternatively, the decreasing trend in testosterone with increasing salmon consumption would occur if bears with low testosterone are consistently more successful at consuming salmon, which might occur if social conditions are stable and dominant bears have low testosterone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C82">Sapolsky, 1993</xref>).Though individual traits would certainly contribute to testosterone levels and should be investigated further, our findings can also be interpreted as further evidence that the social competitive environment is mediated by salmon availability. When salmon is abundant, there would be lower perceived or real competition; consequently, testosterone would be lower and salmon consumption would generally be high (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU010F6">6</xref>A, symbol â€˜câ€™). In contrast, when competition over salmon is more intense, testosterone would be higher and salmon availability would be lower (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU010F6">6</xref>A, letter b). An interaction term in the top model for grizzly bears reflected the trend in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU010F6">6</xref>A (symbol â€˜bâ€™) where testosterone was higher among bears with high salmon consumption when salmon availability was low compared with periods of high salmon availability (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU010F5">5</xref>).Interestingly, the relationship between testosterone and cortisol varied in magnitude as a function of salmon availability in grizzly bears, as our conceptual model predicts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU010F6">6</xref>A, symbols â€˜aâ€™ and â€˜bâ€™). Specifically, cortisol and testosterone are dissociated at low levels of salmon availability, whereas they are correlated positively when salmon abundance is high. This suggests that nutritional stress overwhelms the signal of social stress when salmon availability is low. In contrast to grizzly bears, there was weak evidence that the relationship between cortisol and testosterone varied in magnitude in relationship to salmon availability in black bears. This provides additional evidence that social density or other stressors are stronger among black bears compared with grizzly bears.In conclusion, our findings provide insight into the physiological effects of resource declines on wildlife and could inform future hypothesis testing in this and other systems. In particular, we suggest that parameters in the graphical explanation for our findings would be context dependent, would differ between species, and could be determined empirically with more data. Specifically, future studies could include longitudinal behavioural and ethological observations as well as direct measures of social density, resource availability and resource consumption (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C19">Dantzer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). This would enable incorporation of other aspects of salmon availability, such as stream characteristics and the number of fishing sites, as well as information on age, social status, sex ratios and body size of the bears. The inclusion of female bears, which were not well represented at the hair-snag stations, would provide additional needed insight into population-level processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C10">Bourbonnais <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).Our findings also highlight the potential conservation value of fisheries management practices and quotas that ensure adequate salmon for bears and other salmon consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C20">Darimont <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C50">Levi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Although physiological responses are adaptive mechanisms by which bears cope with environmental heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C9">Boonstra, 2013</xref>), hormone levels in hair might serve as useful early indicators of the welfare of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C68">Paquet and Darimont, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C58">Malcolm <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), potential fitness implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C48">Koren <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) and population trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU010C24">Fefferman and Romero, 2013</xref>). Ultimately, the models presented here can serve in monitoring bear populations over time in relationship to salmon declines, especially when strengthened by expansion and corroboration through further research. Moreover, similar approaches may be valuable in elucidating the complex mechanisms by which resource availability and other human disturbances affect physiology, behaviour and population dynamics in a broad array of species and systems.<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/conphys/cou010/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary material is available at <italic>Conservation Physiology</italic> online</ext-link>.This work was supported by the Raincoast Conservation Foundation; Animal Welfare Institute; Blue Planet Links; Environment Canada Science Horizons; Explorers Club; Habitat Conservation Trust Foundation; Hakai Beach Institute; McLean Foundation; Moore Foundation; Norcross Foundation; National Science and Engineering Council (NSERC) [grant numbers 435683 to C.T.D., RGPIN-106386-2008 to K.E.W.-E. and RGPIN-22876-20 to J.E.G.S.]; Spirit Bear Research Foundation; Tides Canada Wild Salmon Ecosystem Funds; University of Calgary; Willow Grove Foundation; and Wilburforce Foundation.
