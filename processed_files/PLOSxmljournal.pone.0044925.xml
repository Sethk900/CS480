Moreover, BEF research has been mainly derived from studies measuring a single ecosystem process that often represents resource consumption within a given habitat. Focus on single processes has prevented us from exploring the characteristics of ecosystem processes that can be critical in helping us to identify how novel pathways throughout BEF mechanisms may operate. Here, we investigated whether and how the effects of biodiversity mediated by non-trophic interactions among benthic bioturbator species vary according to community biomass and ecosystem processes. We hypothesized that (1) bioturbator biomass and species richness interact to affect the rates of benthic nutrient regeneration [dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP)] and consequently bacterioplankton production (BP) and that (2) the complementarity effects of diversity will be stronger on BP than on nutrient regeneration because the former represents a more integrative process that can be mediated by multivariate nutrient complementarity. We show that the effects of bioturbator diversity on nutrient regeneration increased BP via multivariate nutrient complementarity. Consistent with our prediction, the complementarity effects were significantly stronger on BP than on DIN and TDP. The effects of the biomass-species richness interaction on complementarity varied among the individual processes, but the aggregated measures of complementarity over all ecosystem processes were significantly higher at the highest community biomass level. Our results suggest that the complementarity effects of biodiversity can be stronger on more integrative ecosystem processes, which integrate subsidiary â€œsimplerâ€ processes, via multivariate complementarity. In addition, reductions in community biomass may decrease the strength of interspecific interactions so that the enhanced effects of biodiversity on ecosystem processes can disappear well before species become extinct.The experiment was carried out in accordance with Brazilian regulatory standards for animal ethics, and was approved by the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte Animal Welfare Units. No licenses were necessary for the collection of animals, because species are widely distributed in South America and commonly found even in highly impacted urban aquatic ecosystems such as the sampling site.The bioturbation-mediated fluxes of DIN and TDP were then estimated by subtracting the DIN and TDP fluxes quantified in the individual experimental chambers containing fauna from the average DIN and TDP fluxes calculated from the defaunated controls, respectively.(DIN) Dissolved inorganic nitrogen; (TDP) Total dissolved phosphorus.(TIF)We are indebted to JoÃ£o Marcelo and Alexandre Lopes for field assistance.
