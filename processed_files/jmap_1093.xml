Population dynamics of the Mongolian gerbils: Seasonal patterns and interactions among density, reproduction and climate.The Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) is one of key rodents widely distributed in semi-arid, typical steppes, and desert grasslands in Inner Mongolia, China. We studied population dynamics of Mongolian gerbils under semi-natural conditions using monthly live trapping from 2001 to 2004 in south-central Inner Mongolia. Mongolian gerbils displayed seasonal fluctuations of density and population growth rate. Reproduction and recruitment of gerbils occurred primarily from March-August with a breeding lull in autumn. Population growth rates of Mongolian gerbils were not related to population density but were negatively related to temperature and precipitation. Enhanced reproductive performance and success of females increased population growth of gerbils in our enclosure. We also found that increased temperature and precipitation during the plant growing season negatively affected recruitment and rate of pregnancy. Mongolian gerbils prefer habitats with short, sparse vegetation and dry, loose and sandy soil. Increases in temperature and rainfall enhance vegetation growth; consequently, tall, dense and moist vegetation might reduce the suitability of habitats and retard population growth of Mongolian gerbils. Pronounced seasonal climatic fluctuations in northern latitudes may be the main cause of seasonal population dynamics of Mongolian gerbils.
