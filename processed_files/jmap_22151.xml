Review of the Palaearctic members of the Lispe tentaculata species-group (Diptera, Muscidae): revised key, synonymy and notes on ecologyAbstract The taxonomic reasons for regarding Lispe draperi SÃ©guy, 1933, sp. rev., as a valid species instead of a synonym of Lispe tentaculata (De Geer, 1776) and for treating Lispe quaerens Villeneuve, 1936, syn. n., as a junior synonym of Lispe sericipalpis Stein, 1904 are given. A revised key for the Palaearctic members of the Lispe tentaculata species-group is given. Data on ecology, distribution and feeding preferences are provided.
