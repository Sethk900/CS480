The bee genus Arhysosage Br√®thes (Apidae: Andreninae: Calliopsini): new species, taxonomic notes and new distribution records from BrazilA new species, Arhysosage biguttulata sp. nov., is described and illustrated based on adult specimens collected in the Chaco region of Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil. This new species can be distinguished by its coloration pattern, pilosity and integumental sculpture. Field observations have revealed several aspects of its life history, such as mating behaviour (similar to other Arhysosage species) and its association with the host plant Opuntia sp. (Cactaceae). In addition, Arhysosage flava is recorded for the first time in Brazil, and type-specimen photographs of Arhysosage cactorum Moure, 1999 and Arhysosage melanothricha Moure, 1999 are provided, along with taxonomic notes. http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:4E7C7FF9-44C0-4D77-8C78-B4E0F9C4831F
