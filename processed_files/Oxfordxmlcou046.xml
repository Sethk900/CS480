Our data suggest that the reduction of natural riparian corridor habitats and subsequent increased reliance of woodland migrants on anthropogenic woodlots for stopover is not detrimental to the stress physiology of these birds in a region with limited woodland habitats.Anthropogenic alterations of woodland habitat may influence stopover biology, which in turn could alter the stress physiology of migratory landbirds. Woodland stopover habitats are scarce in the Northern Prairie region of North America and consist of native riparian corridor woodlands (corridors) and smaller, more isolated woodlots of anthropogenic origin around farmsteads (woodlots). Corridor habitats have been greatly reduced since the time of European settlement, but woodlot habitats have appeared over this same time period. In this study, we compared stopover biology and stress physiology of migratory landbirds using natural and anthropogenic woodland habitats. We first tested for differences between birds in the two habitats for baseline corticosterone (CORT<sub>B</sub>) and the magnitude of the stress response for individual species, taxonomic families and foraging guilds. Plasma corticosterone increased significantly for all bird groups in both habitats following 30 min of restraint stress (CORT<sub>30</sub>), and neither CORT<sub>B</sub> nor the magnitude of the stress response (CORT<sub>30</sub> − CORT<sub>B</sub>) differed significantly between birds in the two habitats. Secondly, because CORT<sub>B</sub> levels are often elevated and CORT secretion following a stressor is often suppressed for birds in poor body condition, we hypothesized that woodland migrants with higher fattening rates would show reduced CORT<sub>B</sub> and a robust stress response. We tested this hypothesis by assessing the relationships between plasma corticosterone and plasma metabolites associated with refuelling. We found that CORT<sub>B</sub> was negatively associated and the magnitude of the stress response positively associated with plasma triglycerides (an indicator of fat deposition), with opposite patterns for corticosterone and plasma β-hydroxybutyrate (an indicator of fat catabolism). These data suggest that both corridor and woodlot habitats serve as effective stopover habitat and that the reduction of corridor habitat and increased reliance on anthropogenic woodlots is not detrimental to the stress physiology of migrants in a region with limited woodland habitats.Migration is energetically expensive, and woodland migrant birds must refuel at stopover habitats along the migratory route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C63">Moore and Woodrey, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C102">Yong and Moore, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C62">Moore and Aborn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C97">Wikelski <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C22">Faaborg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Woodland habitats are scarce in the Northern Prairie region of North America and consist of natural riparian corridor woodlands (hereafter corridors) and small anthropogenic woodlots (hereafter woodlots; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C6">Castonguay, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C92">Swanson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C28">Gentry <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). These natural corridors have been greatly reduced and degraded since the time of European settlement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C43">Johnson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C35">Hesse, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C16">Dixon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). The reduction of corridor habitats, however, has occurred simultaneously with an increase in the number of small woodlots of anthropogenic origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C2">Bakker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C92">Swanson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Given that woodland migrants occupy both corridor and woodlot habitats in this region during migratory stopover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C58">Martin, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C13">Dean, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C2">Bakker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C91">Swanson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C92">2005</xref>), these woodlots have the potential to provide a partial substitute for lost and degraded riparian woodlands as stopover habitat for woodland migrant birds.One aspect of the biology of migratory birds that may be influenced by anthropogenic alterations to the natural landscape is their stress physiology, which can impact the timely and successful completion of migration, with potential fitness consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C32">Heglund and Skagen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C5">Carlisle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C19">Eikenaar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Corticosterone (CORT) is the major glucocorticoid secreted in birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C40">Holmes and Phillips, 1976</xref>) and is a primary component of the stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C101">Wingfield <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). In general, plasma CORT levels are low prior to a stressor and increase rapidly (within minutes) in response to stress, reaching a peak after 30–60 min (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C37">Holberton <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). The increase in plasma CORT in response to a stressor is known as the stress response and acts to direct the organism away from energetically costly activities, such as migration, breeding or courtship, to focus on activities that will promote immediate condition improvement and enhance the probability of survival, such as foraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C99">Wingfield <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C100">1995</xref>). Indeed, high plasma CORT may enhance fattening during migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C1">Astheimer <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C54">Long and Holberton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C48">Landys <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C53">Lõhmus <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C38">Holberton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C39">2008</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C18">Eikenaar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C19">2014</xref>). However, plasma CORT levels and stopover duration may show a U-shaped relationship, with migrants potentially having higher baseline CORT (CORT<sub>B</sub>) upon arrival at stopover sites, showing a decline as their body condition improves and an increase shortly before their departure, when fat stores are high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C73">Piersma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C49">Landys-Ciannelli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C18">Eikenaar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Such a U-shaped relationship between stopover duration and plasma CORT may still be consistent with CORT promoting fattening if fat migrants decrease foraging and fattening rate prior to departure (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C55">Loria and Moore, 1990</xref>), concurrent with elevated plasma CORT concentrations to stimulate departure. The elevated plasma CORT concentrations upon departure may function in relationship to other hormones as the cue to induce migratory flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C83">Schwabl <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C49">Landys-Ciannelli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C18">Eikenaar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).Plasma CORT levels in birds may be related to body condition, and many studies suggest that fat birds may show lower levels of CORT<sub>B</sub> and a greater stress response than lean birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C83">Schwabl <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C57">Marra and Holberton, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C36">Holberton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C41">Jenni <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C73">Piersma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C61">Mizrahi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C49">Landys-Ciannelli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C54">Long and Holberton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C77">Raja-aho <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C24">Fokidis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Migrants in corridor and woodlot sites in the present study showed similar refuelling rates, as indicated by plasma metabolite analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C52">Liu and Swanson, 2014</xref>), but whether the foraging effort required to achieve similar refuelling rates differs between corridors and woodlots is unknown. Highly fragmented landscapes, such as the woodlots in the present study, often reduce food availability and require increased foraging effort in comparison to more contiguous habitats, such as the corridor habitats in the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C21">Ellis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). If differences in foraging effort exist between corridor and woodlot habitats, such differences could influence the stress physiology of migrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C45">Kitaysky <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C75">Pravosudov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C56">Mark and Rubenstein, 2013</xref>), despite similar refuelling rates.Differences in the size and structure of corridor and woodlot habitats could also affect other ecological factors, which could, in turn, influence stress physiology of migrant birds. In southeastern South Dakota, the average size of corridor woodlands is more than three times larger than woodlots, which results in much greater amounts of woodland edge for woodlot habitats, and corridors also harbour more diverse vegetation than woodlots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C6">Castonguay, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C28">Gentry <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C52">Liu and Swanson, 2014</xref>). These differences in size, structure and vegetative diversity of corridors and woodlots may produce differences in predation pressure, competition among migrants and thermal microclimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C21">Ellis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), all of which could potentially influence stress physiology. Predation pressure can alter the stopover biology of migrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C50">Lank <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C74">Pomeroy, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C93">Taylor <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) and influence the stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C10">Cockrem and Silverin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C9">Clinchy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C66">Newman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Smaller woodland parcel size and increased edge facilitate the access of predators to smaller woodlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C17">Donovan <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C94">Tewksbury <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), so predation pressure is expected to be higher in woodlots than in corridors in our study area. Such differences in predation pressure could result in differences in stress physiology between migrants in corridors and woodlots in the present study.Competition may also influence stress physiology, and better competitors, such as birds with better body condition or of larger size, may show lower CORT<sub>B</sub> and a greater magnitude of the stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C51">Lehnen and Krementz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C4">Braasch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Hatch-year birds are usually socially subordinate to adults, which may restrict the former's access to limited resources due to competitive interactions with adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C64">Moore <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C22">Faaborg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). In addition, because juveniles in autumn are experiencing their first migration, foraging efficiency during stopover may be lower than that of experienced adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C103">Yong <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C33">Heise and Moore, 2003</xref>). Consequently, the stress response might differ between ages, with higher CORT<sub>B</sub> and a lower stress response in juveniles than in adults. The age ratios of migrants at woodlot and corridor study sites differ, with higher proportions of juveniles at woodlot sites, perhaps resulting from competition with adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C14">Dean <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C52">Liu and Swanson, 2014</xref>); therefore, differences in stress physiology between birds in corridors and woodlots as a function of differing competitive interactions or differing age ratios might be expected.Finally, the smaller size and increased edge of woodlots relative to corridors could affect thermal microclimates of birds in the two habitats. These changes would be likely to contribute to increased penetration of wind into woodlot habitats, which would function to reduce operative temperatures for birds in woodlots relative to corridors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C68">Olson and Grubb, 2007</xref>). Such reduced temperatures may have metabolic consequences for woodland birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C69">Olson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), and thermal stress can influence the stress response in birds, particularly during periods of inclement weather (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C98">Wingfield <italic>et al.</italic>, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C78">Rogers <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C80">Romero <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Thus, differences in microclimate could also contribute to differences in stress physiology for migrants in corridor and woodlot study sites.In the present study, therefore, we tested for differences between birds in corridors and woodlots for CORT<sub>B</sub> and the magnitude of the stress response for individual species, taxonomic families and foraging guilds to determine whether migrants in anthropogenic habitats demonstrate different stress physiology from those in natural riparian corridor habitats. As an additional objective, we also examined whether stress physiology in migrants was correlated with refuelling rates in the two habitats, as measured by plasma metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C52">Liu and Swanson, 2014</xref>).Study sites in Clay County, SD, USA. Open circles denote corridor sites and filled circles woodlot sites. Contiguous woodland areas for the study sites ranged from 1 to 1.6 km<sup>2</sup> for corridor sites and from 0.17 to 0.2 km<sup>2</sup> for woodlot sites.Migrants were captured with 9 m, 36-mm-mesh, nylon mist nets. Each of the six study sites was sampled once per week, and we rotated through the sites in the same order, with woodlot and corridor sites sampled on alternating days during spring (mid-April to early June, 2010–2012) and autumn (mid-August to mid-October, 2010–2011) migration periods. Mist nets were operated for a few hours, beginning at sunrise, and during similar weather conditions, i.e. no rain and relatively low wind speed (&lt;30 kph). We erected up to three nets per individual field worker at each site, and monitored nets continuously so that we could extract birds from the nets immediately upon capture. The initial blood samples for CORT<sub>B</sub> determination were collected within 3 min of birds hitting the net. We collected blood samples with 50 µl heparinized capillary tubes via venipuncture from the brachial vein on the underside of the wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C83">Schwabl <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C99">Wingfield <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C70">Palm <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). A second sample was taken 30 min after capture (CORT<sub>30</sub>), with birds held in cloth bags during the 30 min restraint stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C99">Wingfield <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>). Depending on bird body mass, a maximum of 100–200 µl blood was sampled from each individual bird (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C96">Voss <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). After collection, blood samples were transferred into microcentrifuge tubes and stored on ice while in the field. Upon return to the laboratory, blood samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4°C and 3000<bold><italic>g</italic></bold>. The plasma was then removed to new microtubes and immediately stored at −60°C until later measurement of plasma CORT.Prior to release following blood sampling, we banded birds with United States Geological Survey aluminum leg bands, identified each bird to species, and aged birds (autumn only; using skull ossification, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C76">Pyle, 1997</xref>) as after hatch year (AHY) or hatch year (HY). The date and time of capture were recorded for each bird. Unflattened wing chord and tarsus length were measured with a wing ruler to the nearest 0.5 mm or with callipers to the nearest 0.1 mm. We measured body mass to the nearest 0.1 g with an electronic scale (Ohaus Model LS200) and scored visible fat in the furculum and abdomen on a 0–5 scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C34">Helms and Drury, 1960</xref>). Following blood sampling and morphometric measurements, birds were released at the site of capture. Bird capture, blood sampling and banding were carried out under a Master Banding Permit from the United States Geological Survey Bird Banding Laboratory to D.L.S. All methods in the study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of South Dakota (protocol # 84-03-11-14B).Plasma metabolite data are from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C52">Liu and Swanson (2014)</xref>, who measured plasma concentrations of triglycerides (TRIG), glycerol and β-hydroxybutyrate (BUTY) from the same individual birds for which CORT was measured in the present study. We measured plasma metabolites with commercially available spectrophotometric assay kits (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St Louis, MO, USA) using a Beckman DU-7400 spectrophotometer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C52">Liu and Swanson, 2014</xref>). We did not obtain sufficient volumes of blood from all individuals for all plasma metabolite and CORT measurements, so we determined the relationships between plasma CORT and plasma metabolites from a subset of individuals, for which we had measurements of both CORT and plasma metabolites.We measured plasma CORT concentrations with commercially available microplate spectrophotometric end-point assay kits (Enzo Life Sciences ADI-901-097; Assay Designs Inc., Ann Arbor, MI, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C25">Forster <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). We distributed samples across assay plates evenly with respect to season and species to minimize effects of inter-assay variation on subsequent analyses. All samples, controls and corticosterone standards (0–2000 ng/ml) were run in duplicate. Plasma corticosterone levels were detected by absorbance of samples at 405 nm using an automated plate reader and KineticCalc Jr software (Bio-Tek Instruments, Wonooski, VT, USA). Absorbance values from samples were applied to the standard curve generated (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.99), and CORT levels were expressed as nanograms per millilitre. Absorbance values were also used to calculate the percentage of maximal binding, which ranged from 17.94 to 23.56% (<italic>n</italic> = 21), and the percentage of non-specific binding, which ranged from 2.11 to 2.98% (<italic>n</italic> = 21). The minimal detection limit was 27.0 pg/ml. Inter-assay samples (pooled from blood plasma of multiple species) were included in each of the plasma CORT assays to calibrate measured CORT levels and to monitor variation among assays. Inter-assay variance (average variation among assays) was 6.28% and intra-assay variance (average variation between duplicates) 9.15%.Classification of foraging guild and taxa of migratory landbird species at our study sitesAbbreviations: FGG, foliage-gleaning guild; FLY, flycatchers; GFG, ground-foraging guild; SPA, sparrows; THR, thrushes; VIR, vireos.To adjust for individual differences in body size, we used principal component analysis to incorporate structural measurements (wing chord and tarsus length) to produce a principal component (PC1) for each individual species describing body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C72">Pedhazur, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C31">Guglielmo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). We used a backward stepwise multiple regression approach to generate predictors with CORT<sub>B</sub>, CORT<sub>30</sub> or the magnitude of the stress response as the dependent variable. Independent variables in the model included the principal component for body size, fat score (the average of furcular and abdominal fat scores), age (autumn only), season (foraging guilds only), capture time, capture date and year, with variables retained in the model at <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.10. The variables retained after multiple regressions were maintained as covariates in an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to test for differences between birds from corridors and woodlots. We applied ANCOVA (for CORT<sub>B</sub> and CORT<sub>30</sub>) or repeated-measures ANCOVA (for the magnitude of the stress response) to test for differences between habitat types and ages (autumn only) in both spring and autumn. If no covariates were generated by multiple regressions, we used analysis of variance (ANOVA; for CORT<sub>B</sub> and CORT<sub>30</sub>) or repeated-measures ANOVA (for the magnitude of the stress response) to test for differences between birds from corridors and woodlots. Repeated-measures ANOVA or ANCOVA also allowed us to test whether CORT<sub>B</sub> and CORT<sub>30</sub> differed significantly for all species, taxa and foraging guilds.To control for possible individual species effects on plasma CORT levels in analyses of foraging guilds and taxa, we included species and habitat type as categorical independent variables, along with the species × habitat type interaction term, in the general linear model ANCOVA. The rationale behind this correction for species effects is that different species may show varying raw plasma CORT concentrations, so significant biases could exist in pooled species comparisons if species are combined without controlling for species differences. For individual species with sample sizes ≥10 in both corridors and woodlots, we also applied unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic>-tests to compare fat scores.Finally, for correlation analyses between CORT (CORT<sub>B</sub>, magnitude of the stress response) and plasma metabolites (TRIG and BUTY) and between CORT<sub>B</sub> and the magnitude of the stress response, we normalized data for individual birds to species averages (for species with <italic>n</italic> ≥ 10), so that we could pool data from individual birds in our comparisons. To normalize the CORT and plasma metabolite data for each individual bird, the individual values for CORT<sub>B</sub>, the magnitude of the stress response and plasma TRIG and BUTY levels were divided by the mean value for that species. These normalized data from individual birds were then used for correlation analyses of CORT<sub>B</sub> and the magnitude of the stress response against TRIG and BUTY concentrations and of the magnitude of the stress response against CORT<sub>B</sub>.No species showed significant between-habitat differences in fat scores, although the difference in fat scores for yellow-rumped warblers (<italic>Setophaga coronata</italic>) in autumn approached significance (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,51</sub> = 6.37, <italic>P</italic> = 0.08), with greater fat scores from corridors than from woodlots. We obtained sufficient sample sizes for comparisons between juveniles and adults only for warbling vireos (<italic>Vireo gilvus</italic>) and dark-eyed juncos (<italic>Junco hyemalis</italic>) in autumn, and fat scores were not statistically different between ages for these species.Mean (±SEM) baseline corticosterone (CORT<sub>B</sub>, in nanograms per millilitre) for spring and autumn individual species, taxa and foraging guilds.

In autumn, a significant species effect occurred for CORT<sub>B</sub> only for the sparrow group (<italic>F</italic><sub>5,50</sub> = 3.32, <italic>P</italic> = 0.01) and for the magnitude of the stress response only for the foliage-gleaning guild (<italic>F</italic><sub>5,60</sub> = 3.21, <italic>P</italic> = 0.02). A significant species effect indicates a strong influence of particular species on plasma CORT values for the taxon or foraging group as a whole. After between-habitat comparisons were adjusted statistically for these significant species effects, between-habitat comparisons of CORT<sub>B</sub>, CORT<sub>30</sub> and the magnitude of the stress response remained non-significant for these bird groups. The interaction between species and habitat type for comparisons of plasma CORT was not significant for any foraging guild or taxon in either season.Variables retained in backward stepwise multiple regression models for plasma corticosterone at the <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.10 level for individual species, taxa and foraging guildsPositive or negative symbols indicate direction of effect. ‘None’ means that no covariate showed significant effects on plasma corticosterone levels.

The magnitude of the stress response showed a significant positive correlation with TRIG in both seasons [spring, CORT<sub>30</sub> − CORT<sub>B</sub> = 0.18 + 0.54(TRIG); and autumn, CORT<sub>30</sub> − CORT<sub>B</sub> = 0.17 + 0.46(TRIG)].Relationship between baseline corticosterone (CORT<sub>B</sub>) and the magnitude of the stress response (CORT<sub>30</sub> − CORT<sub>B</sub>).

As a consequence of these differences, migrants stopping over in woodlots could be exposed to different levels of food availability, competition intensity, predation pressure and thermal microclimates than migrants stopping over in corridors, and these factors might lead to differences in stress physiology for birds in woodlots and corridors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C9">Clinchy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C46">Kitaysky <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C68">Olson and Grubb, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C69">Olson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C4">Braasch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). In the present study, however, we found no significant differences for any CORT variables (CORT<sub>B</sub>, CORT<sub>30</sub> or the magnitude of the stress response) between birds captured in corridors and woodlots, suggesting that the stress physiology of migrant birds in both corridors and woodlots is generally similar. In addition, all individual species, taxa and foraging guilds from both spring and autumn migration showed a significant stress response after a 30 min restraint stress, which suggests that birds were in sufficient body condition in both woodland habitats to mount a robust stress response (i.e. a significant increase in plasma CORT with restraint stress). These data suggest that the increased reliance of migrating birds on anthropogenic woodlands with the loss and degradation of natural riparian corridor habitats in the Northern Prairie region, where woodland habitat is scarce, does not negatively impact their stress physiology. This result is consistent with the finding of similar refuelling rates and body condition between birds in the two habitat types at these same study sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C52">Liu and Swanson, 2014</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest similar habitat quality in the two habitat types and support the idea that anthropogenic woodlot habitats can, at least partly, substitute for lost and degraded riparian corridor woodlands as stopover habitat for migrant birds in the Northern Prairie region of North America.Among the covariates influencing plasma CORT levels in our study, sampling year significantly affected CORT<sub>B</sub> for several bird groups in autumn, and CORT<sub>B</sub> levels were higher in 2011 than in 2010 for all of these groups. This result suggests that ecological or environmental conditions (e.g. food availability, predation pressure, intensity of competition, weather) may vary among years at our study sites in a manner that influences stress physiology of migrants. Defining which, if any, of these factors might be associated with the elevated CORT<sub>B</sub> levels in 2011 relative to 2010 will require further study, but two factors potentially related to this pattern bear mentioning. First, a large and prolonged flood impacted the Missouri River throughout the summer and early autumn of 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C65">Munes, 2014</xref>). In addition, autumn 2011 was considerably drier than autumn 2010 near Vermillion, Clay County, southeastern South Dakota, with precipitation in September and October of 2011 only 39% of that during the same months in 2010 (US Climate data, <uri xlink:href="http://www.usclimatedata.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.usclimatedata.com/</uri>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C52">Liu and Swanson (2014)</xref> detected lower plasma TRIG levels in autumn 2011 than in autumn 2010 for several migrant bird groups at these same study sites, suggesting that conditions in autumn 2011 resulted in lower refuelling rates than in autumn 2010, which is consistent with relatively lower quality stopover habitat resulting in elevated CORT<sub>B</sub> levels in autumn 2011.Body size may also be related to plasma CORT<sub>B</sub> levels in birds, with smaller birds exhibiting higher baseline levels than larger birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C51">Lehnen and Krementz, 2005</xref>). In the present study, the principal component describing body size had a significant effect on plasma CORT levels for only a few bird groups. The general absence of an effect of body size on plasma CORT in migrating birds is consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C95">Thomas (2008)</xref>, who documented that the body size of migrating shorebirds did not influence the overall CORT response. However, for those bird groups in our study where body size was significantly related to plasma CORT levels (ground-foraging guild in spring and foliage-gleaning guild and vireos in autumn), body size was negatively related to CORT<sub>B</sub> and positively related to the magnitude of the stress response. This result is consistent with the relationship documented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C51">Lehnen and Krementz (2005)</xref> and suggests that larger birds are in better condition than and/or outcompete smaller individuals for resources in these bird groups. We have no obvious explanation for why such a relationship occurs for only some bird groups and not for others, but perhaps differential use of or access to resources is involved.Hatch-year migrants are undertaking their first migration in autumn, so they are less experienced foragers than adults, which could result in lower refuelling rates, although age-related differences in body condition and refuelling rates are seldom detected at stopover sites (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C86">Seewagen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C52">Liu and Swanson, 2014</xref>). Moreover, juvenile migrants are usually socially subordinate to adults, which may restrict the former's access to limited resources due to competitive interactions with experienced adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C103">Yong <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C33">Heise and Moore, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C64">Moore <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C22">Faaborg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). As a consequence, the stress response may differ between age classes, with higher CORT<sub>B</sub> and a lower stress response in juveniles than in adults. In the present study, we did not detect significant differences in CORT<sub>B</sub>, CORT<sub>30</sub> or the magnitude of the stress response between adults and juveniles. This is similar to the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C95">Thomas (2008)</xref>, who found little difference in plasma CORT levels between adult and juvenile least (<italic>Calidris minutilla</italic>) and semipalmated sandpipers (<italic>Calidris pusilla</italic>). This suggests that ecological and environmental conditions at our stopover sites provided effective stopover habitat for both adults and juvenile birds such that age-related differences in stress physiology were not evident.We obtained sufficient samples sizes for between-season comparisons only for foliage-gleaning and ground-foraging guilds and found that both groups had higher CORT<sub>B</sub> and a greater magnitude of the stress response in the spring compared with autumn migration. Spring migration is potentially more urgent than autumn, because early arrival on the breeding grounds generally shows a positive correlation with fitness (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C88">Smith and Moore, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C12">Cooper <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C27">Gargallo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C29">Gienapp and Bregnballe, 2012</xref>). Spring migrants typically migrate at a faster pace than autumn migrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C71">Pearson and Lack, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C20">Ellegren, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C26">Fransson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C44">Kemp <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), which may reflect differences in their physiological capacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C89">Swanson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C90">Swanson and Dean, 1999</xref>). These differences might result in higher CORT<sub>B</sub> in spring than in autumn migrants and promote greater foraging intensity and better refuelling performance than for birds during the more leisurely autumn migration. Such an explanation is consistent with our previous study suggesting better refuelling performance in spring migrants than in autumn migrants at these same study sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C52">Liu and Swanson, 2014</xref>).The migration modulation hypothesis proposes that migrants maintain elevated CORT<sub>B</sub> levels during migration and show a suppressed stress response when faced with additional acute stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C37">Holberton <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>), thereby facilitating fattening while sparing muscle protein. Consistent with this hypothesis, elevated CORT<sub>B</sub> levels, a suppressed stress response, or both, occur in a number of wild migrant or photostimulated, migratory-ready captive birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C37">Holberton <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C38">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C73">Piersma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C49">Landys-Ciannelli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C54">Long and Holberton, 2004</xref>). However, numerous studies also document significant stress responses in wild migrant or photostimulated captive birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C79">Romero <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C73">Piersma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C49">Landys-Ciannelli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C23">Falsone <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C67">Nilsson and Sandell, 2009</xref>), suggesting that full suppression of the stress response does not occur in most migrants or that the degree of suppression changes with the stage of migratory stopover. However, the magnitude of the stress response in these birds may sometimes be influenced by body condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C61">Mizrahi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C42">Jenni-Eiermann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C77">Raja-aho <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), so energetic condition could influence the modulation of the stress response during migration. A corollary prediction of the migration modulation hypothesis is that CORT<sub>B</sub> and the magnitude of the stress response should be inversely related, even if the stress response is not fully suppressed. The suppressed stress response when facing additional acute stressors might result from negative feedback of elevated CORT<sub>B</sub> during migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C77">Raja-aho <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). In the present study, we found a significant negative relationship between CORT<sub>B</sub> and the magnitude of the stress response, despite robust stress responses for all bird groups studied, which is consistent with this corollary prediction of the migration modulation hypothesis.High plasma CORT concentrations may promote elevated levels of gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis, leading to fat deposition, while also stimulating protein catabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C40">Holmes and Phillips, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C3">Berdanier, 1989</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C18">Eikenaar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C19">2014</xref>). Plasma levels of TRIG and BUTY are considered the best metabolites for plasma metabolite profiling in birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C30">Guglielmo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C31">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C87">Smith and McWilliams, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C85">Seewagen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) and they are now routinely used to measure fattening rates of birds during migration because plasma TRIG increases during fat deposition and plasma BUTY increases during fat catabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C82">Schaub and Jenni, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C84">Seaman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C7">Cerasale and Guglielmo, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C8">2010</xref>). We found a significant negative correlation of CORT<sub>B</sub> and a significant positive correlation of the magnitude of the stress response with plasma TRIG for birds in the present study. Plasma BUTY showed significant opposite patterns of correlations with CORT<sub>B</sub> and the magnitude of the stress response in comparison to plasma TRIG. These data support our hypotheses that high-quality habitat promotes effective fattening and reduced CORT<sub>B</sub>, while allowing a robust stress response.Furthermore, CORT measures can potentially provide additional information regarding the relationships among the stress response, fattening, body condition and stopover biology in migrants. Plasma CORT shows a U-shaped relationship with fat stores in shorebirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C73">Piersma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C18">Eikenaar <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref> found a positive correlation between plasma CORT and fat stores before departure for a passerine bird, the northern wheatear (<italic>Oenanthe oenanthe</italic>). If landbird migrants also show a U-shaped relationship between plasma CORT and fat stores during stopover, but a linear relationship with plasma metabolites (present study), analyses including CORT, plasma metabolites and fat stores might allow teasing apart of the effects of different stopover durations prior to capture on plasma metabolite comparisons. The U-shaped relationship between plasma CORT<sub>B</sub> with stopover duration in shorebirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C73">Piersma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>) suggests that migrants have high CORT<sub>B</sub> levels upon arrival at a stopover site and then show a decline as their body condition improves, only to increase CORT again before departure, when fat stores are high (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C18">Eikenaar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Such a pattern might be driven by differential sensitivity of receptors to CORT at different CORT levels or by regulation of the hypothalamo–pituitary–adrenal axis at the brain level (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C15">de Kloet <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C60">Matthews, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C81">Sapolsky, 2002</xref>). As a consequence, migrating birds may show considerable variation in the relationship between CORT<sub>B</sub> and fat stores. Indeed, negative relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C54">Long and Holberton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C77">Raja-aho <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), positive relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C79">Romero <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C36">Holberton, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C49">Landys-Ciannelli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C47">Landys <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C18">Eikenaar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) and no relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C37">Holberton <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C61">Mizrahi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>) between CORT<sub>B</sub> and fat stores or energetic condition have been documented among migratory birds. We found no significant relationships between fat scores and CORT<sub>B</sub> for any individual species, taxon or foraging guild during spring migration. During autumn migration, fat score was a significant covariate in multiple regression models for several bird groups and showed a consistent positive relationship with CORT<sub>B</sub> and negative relationship with the magnitude of the stress response in these groups. One possible explanation for these results is that fat birds within these groups were ready to migrate, and elevated CORT<sub>B</sub> levels and a smaller stress response prior to departure served to prepare them for upcoming behavioural and metabolic transitions during migratory flights, similar to the suggestion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C73">Piersma <italic>et al.</italic> (2000)</xref> for shorebirds and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU046C18">Eikenaar <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref> for northern wheatears. Tracking these variables concurrently during stopover might allow more precise estimation of the stage of migratory stopover from a single blood sample than has been possible to date. However, validation of the potential for this method will require much additional research and larger sample sizes for individual species than those in the present study.<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/conphys/cou046/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary material is available at <italic>Conservation Physiology</italic> online.</ext-link>This study was funded by grants from the US Fish and Wildlife Service (Award Number F10AC00572), University of South Dakota and South Dakota Ornithologists' Union (Nathaniel R.
