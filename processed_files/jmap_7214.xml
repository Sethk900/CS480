Consideraciones sobre la ecolog√≠a alimentaria del Chiviro de Isla Saltator coerulescens coerulescens y el Chiviro de Corbata Saltator aurantiirostris aurantiirostris (Aves: Emberizidae) en el valle aluvial del R√≠o Paran√° Medio (Argentina)Food composition of the Greyish and the Golden‚Äbilled Saltator was studied by examination of stomach contents in the course of the year. These emberizine birds living near the Parana river in Argentine show a relatively broad spectrum of food items both from seeds and insects, but plant seed are most important. Food niche overlap is considerable and amounts to 44% (index of overlap). The results are shown for both species for the different seasons in the figs.
