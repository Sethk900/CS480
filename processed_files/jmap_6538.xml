Phytotoxic response to foliar applications of molybdenum in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.)Foliar applications of sodium molybdate solutions adversely affected the growth of tomato plants so that reductions in plant height and dry matter yield were associated with most treatments applied. Fifty per cent of the plants which were subjected to treatments more severe than ≥125 mg Na2MoO4 plant−1 failed to survive. Although all plants survived the less severe treatments many subsequently developed sublethal symptoms of toxicity including stem bending, abnormal leaf structure and in the case of treatments ≥125 mg plant−1 some leaves developed an intense gold colour. Suggestions regarding re-evaluation of supplementary fertilization needs of plants with low Mo requirements are made.
