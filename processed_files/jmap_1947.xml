Root dynamics and demography in shortgrass steppe under elevated CO2, and comments on minirhizotron methodology.The dynamics and demography of roots were followed for 5 years that spanned wet and drought periods in native, semiarid shortgrass steppe grassland exposed to ambient and elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> treatments. Elevated compared with ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations resulted in greater root-length growth (+52%), root-length losses (+37%), and total pool sizes (+41%). The greater standing pool of roots under elevated compared with ambient CO<sub>2</sub> was because of the greater number of roots (+35%), not because individuals were longer. Loss rates increased relatively less than growth rates because life spans were longer (+41%). The diameter of roots was larger under elevated compared with ambient CO<sub>2</sub> only in the upper soil profile. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> affected root architecture through increased branching.
