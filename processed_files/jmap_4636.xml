Effect of adjuvants on apple fruit and leaf calcium and nitrogen concentrations at three fruit growth stagesIn a field trial, 0.006% v/v Agral-90® and four alternative adjuvants were evaluated to determine their effects on calcium (Ca) and nitrogen (N) uptake by leaves and fruit of ‘Golden Delicious’ apple from 0.45% m/v calcium nitrate sprays. No bitter pit was observed at harvest or after storage, all trees having received 12 sprays. The industry standard, 0.006% Agral-90®, did not affect fruit or leaf Ca or N levels, or Ca/N ratios, relative to the adjuvant-free control, after 6, 9 or 12 (harvest) sprays. Break-Thru® (0.025%), and 0.05% AG6210, significantly (P = 0.05) increased fruit Ca concentrations after nine (but not six or 12) sprays. Fruit Ca/N ratios at harvest, did not differ from the adjuvant free control in any treatment. Increased leaf Ca concentrations were observed after 9 sprays where Break-Thru® (0.025%), SEW (0.05%), AL2575 (0.05% and 0.10%) and AG6210 (0.10%) were added. SEW (0.05%) increased leaf Ca levels after six sprays. At harvest, after 12 sprays, leaf Ca concentrations in the various adjuvant treatments were similar to those in the adjuvant-free control. Leaf Ca/N ratios were greater than the control in the 0.05% SEW treatment after six sprays, in the Break-Thru® (0.025%), SEW (0.05% and 0.10%) and AL2575 (0.05%) treatments after nine sprays, and in the AG6210 (0.05%) treatment at harvest.
