Feeding Value of Singed Walkingstick Cholla.Walkingstick cholla cactus (Opuntia imbricata [Haw.] DC) has been used in New Mexico as an emergency feed during drought for more than 100 years. Most reports present only the chemical composition of walkingstick cholla, and limited data exist regarding its feeding value. Three wethers (avg wt 65±7 kg) were fed a basal diet of mature blue grama hay (Bouteloua gracilis [HBK] Lag. ex Steud., 9.0% crude protein [CP] and 69.0% neutral detergent fiber [NDF], organic matter [OM] basis) in a replicated 3Ã—3 Latin square to determine digestibility of singed walkingstick cholla and to measure nitrogen balance. Treatments consisted of 0%, 15%, and 20% walkingstick cholla in the diet on a dry matter (DM) basis. Walkingstick cholla contained 20.3% DM, 79.6% OM, 36.4% NDF, and 9.0% CP (OM basis). Walkingstick cholla clippings, consisting of green, nonwoody cladodes, were harvested in September. Cactus was singed with a propane torch until no spines remained, chopped, and added to the diet each day. Walking...
