Strutting sounds and strutting: Posturing of two Utah sage grouse populationsSound and video tape recordings and still pictures were taken of two populations of strutting male sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). The two populations studied were from the Strawberry Valley and Parker Mountains. Sixteen elements of sounds were identified in the strutting sequence. These elements were the same for both populations. Video tape and still picture analysis revealed that both populations were similar in posturing during the strutting sequence. We concluded that the Parker Mountains sage grouse population is suitable in terms of breeding display behavior to augment the Strawberry Valley population. Sexual compatibility would need to be determined in future studies.
