GIS-fuzzy logic based approach in modeling soil texture: Using parts of the Clay Belt and Hornepayne region in Ontario Canada as a case studyThere is a growing global need to generate high resolution digital soil maps for numerous ecological applications. We aim to address this issue by modeling and mapping soil texture using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and fuzzy logic techniques over parts of the Clay Belt and Hornepayne region in Ontario, Canada as a case study. This was performed based on the soil-environment model (case-based reasoning approach) using a 10-m LiDAR Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and derivatives such as slope, surface curvature, smooth multi-path wetness index, slope position classification in combination with landcover, mode of deposition and spatial cases of soil texture information. A map of six soil textural classes (organic, coarse loamy, silt, clay, fine sand, and coarse sand) was produced at 10-m resolution across 430,076 ha that proved accurate in validation of 79% of the time. The application of these techniques and approach could enable soil scientists to easily generate and improve current digital soil maps.
