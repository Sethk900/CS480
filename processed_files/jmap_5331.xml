Effect of temperature on the flight activity of culicids in Buenos Aires City, ArgentinaDaily temperature could determine mosquito activity and competence for transmitting arboviruses. This work aims to determine the seasonal occurrence of mosquito species and to characterize their flight activity in relation to the mean daily temperature in Buenos Aires, Argentina (March 1998 to April 2001). The proportion of capture events for each culicid species throughout all seasons and thermal ranges, obtained by classifying daily mean temperatures corresponding to every capture event, was compared using a test for multiple independent proportions. Twenty-three species from six genera were captured and two groups could be identified: group 1, species captured in all thermal ranges and group 2, species not captured below 11Â°C. Flight activity of the different species would be affected by daily and seasonal mean temperature. Species of group 1, which are present throughout the year, seem to be triggered above a certain threshold of temperature, regardless of the season. Group 2 species would display a seasonal activity pattern.
