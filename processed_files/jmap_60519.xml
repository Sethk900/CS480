ASTER observations of thermal anomalies preceding the April 2003 eruption of Chikurachki volcano, Kurile Islands, RussiaChikurachki volcano (Northern Kurile Islands Chain, Paramushir Island 50Ã‚Â° 20Ã¢Â€Â²N, 155Ã‚Â° 27Ã¢Â€Â²E; elevation 1816 m, stratovolcano) has been in a state of unrest for over twenty years. Its most recent eruption that began in April 2003 was preceded by an eruption between January and May 2002. Thermal infrared images from the JapaneseÃ¢Â€Â“United States' Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection radiometer (ASTER-5 TIR channels, 8Ã¢Â€Â“12 ÃŽÂ¼m, 90 m/pixel, Noise Equivalent Delta Temperature [NEÃŽÂ”T] Ã¢ÂˆÂ¼0.1Ã¢Â€Â“0.3 K; onboard the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Terra polar-orbiting spacecraft) of a snow-covered Chikurachki Volcano taken in January 2003 show muted evidence of thermal activity. ASTER thermal infrared (TIR) images from February 2003, however, indicate warmer areas within the summit crater. Average whole-pixel temperatures of adjacent summit slopes are in the range of 250Ã¢Â€Â“252 K, while many summit-crater whole pixel temperatures are Ã¢ÂˆÂ¼2Ã¢Â€Â“6 K greater. A two component Planck solution for the warmer pixels yields a solution of 275Ã¢Â€Â“277 K for 10Ã¢Â€Â“15% of the Chikurachki summit crater and 285Ã¢Â€Â“295 K for 25Ã¢Â€Â“35% of a prominent Ã¢Â€ÂœhotspotÃ¢Â€Â on its flank. An interpretation of this enhanced pre-eruption heat flow is the presence of surface melt water. The detection in ASTER data of such subtle precursory heat-flow enhancement, even retrospectively, raises important issues for remote monitoring of Ã¢Â€ÂœdormantÃ¢Â€Â snow-capped volcanoes, especially those that threaten nearby populations, like Mt. Rainier.
