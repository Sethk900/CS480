Salts in carrier water affect tralkoxydim activityTralkoxydim {2-[1-(ethoxyimino)-3-hydroxy-5-(2,4,6-trimethyl-phenyl)]cyclohex-2-enone} was tested for susceptibility to antagonism from ions in the carrier water with which it is applied. Borehole and municipal water and deionized water, to which various salts were added, were tested. Tralkoxydim activity was antagonized by 20% with the addition of various water carriers.Sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate were identified as the main antagonists of tralkoxydim activity. Sodium bicarbonate antagonized tralkoxydim activity by 62% at 0.03M of the cation and by 31% at concentrations as low as 0.001 M of the cation.
