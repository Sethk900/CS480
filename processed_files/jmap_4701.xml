Recurrent selection for resistance in maize to the African stalk borer, Busseola fusca (Fuller)Stem borer resistant inbred lines Mp704 and Mp706 of Mississippi origin were used as donor parents in a recurrent selection programme, to develop locally adapted germplasm with improved resistance to the stalk borer Busseola fusca. The segregating progenies of crosses between resistant and susceptible lines were planted ear-to-row, with selection based on the incidence of leaf feeding damage and stunting, following artificial infestation of plants with neonate larvae. Resistance derived from the two sources was combined after two cycles of selection, which resulted in high levels of resistance being achieved over a relatively short period. Combining ability for yield was evaluated at the S3 level of inbreeding, using 1137TN as tester. Compared with commercial hybrids, a number of test crosses were identified with superior yield under conditions of stalk borer infestation and comparative yields in the absence of attack. Characterization data were obtained on 42 lines intended for release.
