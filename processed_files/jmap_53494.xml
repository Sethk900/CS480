Sphecid wasp larvae feeding on large-sized cockroaches in a dead wood cavityWe investigated the nest site and prey items of Isodontia auripygata (Hymenoptera: Sphecidae) in a subtropical forest on Iriomote Island, ca. 200 km east of Taiwan. I. auripygata used the cavity of a dead branch as their nest site, and the nest was composed of two cells that were divided by wood offcuts. Inside the branch, we found large-sized adult cockroaches, Rhabdoblatta formosana (Blattodea: Epilampridae), R. formosana adults were fed to an I. auripygata larva in each cell. To our knowledge, this is the third record of species of the genus Isodontia that prey on cockroaches.
