Fencerows, Edges, and Implications of Changing Connectivity Illustrated by Two Contiguous Ohio LandscapesWe evaluated the amounts and implications of changes in habitat connectivity on rural landscapes\nby modeling the colonization success and subsequent habitat colonization of a model edge organism\nwithin real landscapes. We first inventoried the changes in the fencerow and forest-edge network of two contiguous\nOhio (USA.) landscapes, an agriculturally dominated till plain and a more diverse and dynamic moraine\nlandscape, from 1940 to 1988. On the momine the number of fencerows changed little from 1940 to\n1971. The number increased by 86 during 1971-1988 as marginal farms were subdivided. me total length of\nfencerows on the moraine increased 2.5fold over 48 years. On the till plain the number and total length of\nfencerows remained relatively constant through the study period. The sum of fencerows and forest edges was\nused as a measure of total ecotonal edge. On the moraine total edge increased through the study period,\nwhereas on the tillplain it decreased. We selected two levels of landscape connectivity, low and high, to model\nanimal habitat colonization success. As connectivity increased the earliest successful colonists preempted an\nincreasingly large proportion of the total suitable habitat, and the probability of szrccessfzirl colonization by\nlater-arriving individuals decreased. me changes in connectivity that resulted from changes in both the\nfencerow network and the proportion of forested land have resulted in contiguous landscapes that present\nvery different colonization potentials to organisms with long-distance dispersal capability. Given the current\nuncertainty of the effects of corridors on species-preservation efforts, we suggest that further modeling of this\ntype prior to field testing will add useful insights, especially if conducted using specific species and landscape\ntypes.
