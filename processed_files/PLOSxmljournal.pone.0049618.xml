We studied TKE as a function of biodiversity, functional diversity as well as structural stand variables in a secondary subtropical broad-leaved forest in the Gutianshan National Nature Reserve (GNNR) in south-east China, a biodiversity hotspot in the northern hemisphere with more than 250 woody species present. Using a mixed model approach we could identify significant effects of all these variables on TKE: TKE increased with rarefied tree species richness and decreased with increasing proportion of needle-leaved species and increasing leaf area index (LAI). Furthermore, for average rainfall amounts TKE was decreasing with tree canopy height whereas for high rainfall amounts this was not the case. The spatial pattern of throughfall was stable across several rain events. The temporal variation of TKE decreased with rainfall intensity and increased with tree diversity. Our results show that more diverse forest stands over the season have to cope with higher cumulative raindrop energy than less diverse stands. However, the kinetic energy (KE) of one single raindrop is less predictable in diverse stands since the variability in KE is higher. This paper is the first to contribute to the understanding of the ecosystem function of soil erosion prevention in diverse subtropical forests.  interception of raindrops by leaves and branches;  high infiltration rates of forest soils due to low bulk densities and high pore volumes;  plant root systems securing the soil.  Basic measures for crown openness within a specific forest stand or a specific position within a forest stand can be expressed through estimating coverage values of the different tree layers present in the canopy or LAI. LAI is of major interest when considering throughfall amount and properties. It quantifies effects of canopy thickness, leaf and branch count. However, LAI does not account for possible heterogeneity in horizontal leaf area distribution, which may also be affected by tree diversity.  We test these hypotheses with field observations carried out in a high diversity forest ecosystem in subtropical SE China.  This study was conducted in the Gutianshan National Nature Reserve (GNNR), Zhejiang Province, P.R. China. An entrance permit to the nature reserve was obtained by the administration of the GNNR (Zhejiang Province, China).  Event-related variables include rainfall amount, intensity and KE as well as wind speed during the events. Individual variables were tested for collinearity before setting up the models. They were sorted by five groups in the order of their expected impact, namely event characteristics, age/height of the vegetation, diversity measures, crown openness and leaf traits:  Results of the simplified mixed effects model. Fixed factors in the model were the predictors and their interactions as shown in the table.

However, functional leaf trait diversity appeared to have no significant effect and did not enter the final model. LAI as a variable describing â€œcrown opennessâ€ had a significant negative effect on TKE. The higher the LAI, the lower is TKE. Tree layer cover and non-rarified species richness did not improve model quality.  Among â€œleaf traitsâ€, the proportion of coniferous species in a given plot had a significant negative impact on TKE. Plots with a higher proportion of coniferous species in the tree layer generally receive less TKE. Variables not mentioned further here did not improve model quality.

In this study we did not only demonstrate that biotic variables influenced the average TKE, but also its variability. We also showed that the effects of rainfall event characteristics were modulated by tree diversity and canopy structure.  The significant interaction between rainfall amount and tree canopy height showed that there is a different relation between height of the vegetation and TKE for different rainfall amounts. Moreover, this means that with increasing rainfall amount the effect of canopy height is changing direction from slightly negative to slightly positive. This suggests that in older, structurally more complex forests rainfall events need to be of a certain amount until TKE can reach higher values.  We might need additional variables describing canopy structure to explain this counterintuitive relationship of decreasing TKE with increasing canopy height. This conclusion is supported by the stable spatial pattern of KE quantified by the variance component of the splash cup position. This shows that different positions within the plot received similar KE across rainfall events, which could not be explained by the variables we tested. These variables seem to modulate TKE especially in conditions of relatively low amounts of rainfall, while canopy height retains the expected positive relation to KE for high amounts of rainfall. For further studies we plan to apply laser scanning techniques to quantify additional spatial properties of the canopy apart from canopy height.  Besides height, identity of the tree traits, crown openness and biodiversity also influenced TKE significantly.  In contrast to several factors explaining average TKE, its variability is controlled by two factors only. Furthermore, the effect sizes of these two factors are comparable and do not differ by one order of magnitude as in the analysis on mean TKE. Concerning the variability of TKE, event characteristics and diversity measures independently explained a significant amount of variation in the variance of TKE in the plots. This variance of raindrop energy can be interpreted in two ways: (1) as a measure of raindrop size diversity and (2) as the heterogeneity of the spatial distribution of TKE in total. A high variance means that very small as well as very large raindrops have reached the splash cups, while a low variance indicates more uniform raindrops. Rain-shadow positions in a dense diverse canopy could also affect the variability in keeping rainfall away from certain positions. In contrast to the previous analysis, rainfall intensity affected this variance more than rainfall amount, which was the best measure for the variability of raindrop energy below canopies.  Summing up we can state that the variability of TKE is highest during events with low peak rainfall intensities and in plots with high tree species richness.  This study is the first to reveal mechanisms and processes of soil erosion prevention related to biodiversity acting in quasi-natural species rich forests. The calibrated splash cups used in this study across a large number of plots turned out to be a feasible but also highly effective and reliable tool to measure the amount and variability of TKE. It could be shown that TKE in forests was higher than in the open field which was mainly caused by a redistribution of throughfall volume in forests and altered drop sizes.  Rainfall amount and several biotic factors showed to be important factors explaining and influencing TKE in forests. Here, we could demonstrate that, especially under conditions of high rainfall amounts, taller (older) forests face a higher risk of splash-induced erosion than shorter (younger) forests. Apart from canopy height, other biotic factors influence TKE in forests, in our case LAI, biodiversity (tree species richness) and the proportion of needle-leaved species. In contrast to our first hypothesis (H1), TKE increased instead of decreased with biodiversity in the plots. As we focused only on the tree and shrub layer when describing the biodiversity of a plot the role of lower shrubs, herbs and other near-surface vegetation for TKE remains an open question and deserves further research.  In consistence with the second hypothesis (H2) higher crown openness (and therefore a lower LAI) resulted in higher TKE values. In turn a higher LAI reduced TKE and throughfall amount. The mechanism of drop retention and re-interception is therefore supposed to superimpose the mechanism of concentration of water via confluence which would result in larger drops.  Moreover â€“ and corresponding to the third hypothesis (H3) â€“ we showed that a higher proportion of needle leaved species within a specific forest stand reduced TKE. This shows a strong influence of canopy composition with regard to leaf traits. Nevertheless, we did not encounter a difference between deciduous and evergreen species. Here, especially phenology may play a major role.  In contrast to TKE itself the variability of TKE could be described by rainfall intensity and biodiversity, which corresponds to hypothesis 1 (H1) and hypothesis 4 (H4). These two factors seem to act independently of each other in the forest ecosystem studied. The variability of TKE was highest in highly diverse forests during rainfall events with low intensities.
