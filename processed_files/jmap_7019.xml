A descriptive account of capybara behaviourA study of capybara behaviour was made on two large ranches in the llanos of Venezuela. Animals were marked with numbered, brightly coloured collars and observations were recorded with a videocamera. Capybaras were found to regurgitate and reâ€chew food material at frequent intervals throughout the day when they were resting, complementing coprophagy as an aid to digestion. Social organization as reported by others was confirmed, however some exceptional behavioural actions were recorded on videotape. Reaction to predators and infant predation is described, as well as vocalizations, grooming, contact between individuals, marking, territory and home range.
