Colour change in Darwin's frogs (Rhinoderma darwinii, Duméril and Bibron, 1841) (Anura: Rhinodermatidae)In the laboratory, wild-caught male Rhinoderma darwinii frogs, but not females, changed body colour from brown to green starting with the appearance of green dorsal spots or a greenish dorsal tone on a brown body colour. After a year in captivity, most males exhibited a greenish or complete green dorsal colour, probably induced by the terrarium's swamp (green) vegetation and season.
