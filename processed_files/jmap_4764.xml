First record of Monobrachium parasitum Mereschkowsky, 1877 (Cnidaria: Hydrozoa) from Brazil, in the tropical southwestern Atlantic, and its implication for bipolarity conceptsProject HABITATS was recently initiated in the Campos Basin (20.5–24° S), state of Rio de Janeiro, to assess biological impacts of petroleum exploration and exploitation on the continental shelf and slope of Brazil. Among species discovered in benthic samples from the area is the hydroid Monobrachium parasitum Mereschkowsky, 1877, occurring in an epibiotic association with the pelecypod mollusc Mendicula ferruginosa (Forbes, 1844): this is the first report of an association between the two species. Monobrachium parasitum has always been reported from cold waters, and is generally considered bipolar. This report records the occurrence of M. parasitum at lower latitudes, where they have seldom been collected: it is also the first account of this species from South America and the southwestern Atlantic. Moreover, the bathymetric distribution of M. parasitum is extended to a depth of 998 m. No previous records exist of hydroids from the Brazilian continental slope.
