Predicting transport of three cations in soil columns under conditions of steady-state flow, IndiaThe breakthrough curves (BTCs) of signal cation(s) i.e., Na+ and/or Mg2+ for Ca2+Na+Mg2+, Ca2+Na2+ and Ca2+Mg2+ systems were obtained at different pulse volumes and pore-velocities using calcium saturated columns of sandy loam and clay loam samples. The BTCs showed that (1) the appearance of the signal cation was independent of the pulse volume, (2) the maximum reduced concentration and retention volume increased with the increase in pulse volume at a given pore velocity, (3) the maximum reduced concentration of the cation at a given pulse volume was greater at high than at low pore velocity, and (4) there was a delayed appearance in the effluent of the divalent cation as compared to the monovalent cation. The BTCs of Na2+ and Mg2+ for a Ca2+Na+Mg2+ system, those of Na+ for a Ca2+Na+ system and those of Mg2+for a Ca2+Mg2+ system were also predicted using the analytical solution of the relevant equation for one-dimensional convective-dispersive transport of a solute under given initial and boundary conditions. Predicted BTCs of Na+ agreed well with those observed for the sandy loam sample for Ca2+Na+Mg2+ and Ca2+Na+ systems and in the clay loam sample only for the Ca2+Na+Mg2+ system at a small pulse volume. For other treatments of the clay loam sample, the agreement between predicted and observed BTCs was rather poor. There were considerable deviations between predicted and experimental BTCs of Mg2+ for both soil samples.
