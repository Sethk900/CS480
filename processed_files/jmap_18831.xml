Seasonal dynamics of soil carbon dioxide efflux and simulated rhizosphere respiration in a beech forestRespiration of the rhizosphere in a beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest was calculated by subtracting microbial respiration associated with organic matter decomposition from daily mean soil CO2 efflux. We used a semi-mechanistic soil organic matter model to simulate microbial respiration, which was validated against "no roots" data from trenched subplots. Rhizosphere respiration exhibited pronounced seasonal variation from 0.2 g C m(-2) day(-1) in January to 2.3 g C m(-2) day(-1) in July. Rhizosphere respiration accounted for 30 to 60% of total soil CO2 efflux, with an annual mean of 52%, The high Q(10) (3.9) for in situ rhizosphere respiration was ascribed to the confounding effects of temperature and changes in root biomass and root and shoot activities. When data were normalized to the same soil temperature based on a physiologically relevant Q(10) value of 2.2, the lowest values of temperature-normalized rhizosphere respiration were observed from January to March, whereas the highest value was observed in early July when fine root growth is thought to be maximal.
