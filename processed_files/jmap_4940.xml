Effects of fragmentation on genetic variation in populations of the terrestrial earthworm Drawida japonica Michaelsen, 1892 (Oligochaeta, Moniligastridae) in Shandong and Liaodong peninsulas, ChinaEarthworms are excellent indicators of landscape fragmentation due to their widespread distribution and poor dispersal abilities over water. Based on field studies conducted in the Shandong and Liaodong peninsulas and their associated islands during summer 2009, we analysed the genetic variation of Drawida japonica Michaelsen, 1892 (Oligochaeta, Moniligastridae) using DNA sequences of the 16S and 28S ribosomal genes in samples obtained from 13 localities, 12 of which were islands, one artificially connected to the mainland by man (Yangma SC). We identified 55 haplotypes among 79 samples, based on 1094 bp, including 47 unique haplotypes. The phylogenetic tree topologies showed two distinct clades. A multiple-apex Poisson distribution using a mismatch analysis of nucleotides was also detected. Results of a Tajima D neutral test were not significant (p > 0.05). Genetic divergence among populations was much larger than within populations. A positive relationship between genetic diversity and island area was revealed, but no significant correlation between genetic diversity and distance to the nearest larger landmass was found. These results indicate that the intraspecific genetic diversity of D. japonica has been influenced by geographic isolation (i.e. island habitat). Passive transport via anthropogenic activities or nonhuman vertebrates (birds or mammals) may also play a key role in dispersal.
