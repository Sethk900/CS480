Two new Sarsiellinae (Ostracoda: Myodocopa) from Ningaloo Reef (Western Australia), with a cladistic analysis of the subfamily and keys to generaTwo new Sarsiellinae from Ningaloo Reef, Spinacopia ningalooi sp. nov., and Metasarsiella caleyi sp. nov. are described. Spinacopia ningalooi is the first representative of the genus collected from a coral reef. It differs from the other species by its odd looking posterior infold. Metasarsiella caleyi sp. nov. is the first species of the genus reported from Australia. Keys to species of Spinacopia Kornicker, 1969 and Metasarsiella Kornicker, 1991, and to all the genera of Sarsiellinae are given here, together with an inventory of all the species and information on their distributions and biology. The results of two cladistic analyses (with unweighted and with weighted characters) of the subfamily based on 138 species and 34 morphological characters are presented. The first analysis resulted in seven equally parsimonious trees and the second in just one. The majority rule of the first group of trees and the tree from the second analysis are presented here.
