VOLUNTEER COLLECTION STATION USE FOR OBTAINING GROUSE WING SAMPLESVolunteer wing collection stations were tested in Middle Park, Colorado [USA] during 1975-1979 as an alternative means of inexpensively increasing collected grouse wing samples. Of 3791 blue grouse (Dendragapus obscurus) and sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) wings collected, 3213 (84.7%) were deposited in wing stations. Less time, manpower and expense were required to operate volunteer wing stations for the entire season than for check stations on opening weekend. Besides the basic population data derived from wing analyses, other important management information obtained included identification of major harvest areas, evaluation of hunter success and assessment of harvest distribution over time.
