New species and rediagnosis of Coecobrya (Collembola: Entomobryidae), with a key to the species of the genusThe history of Coecobrya is traced and the genus is redefined. Two new species are described and one known species is redescribed in this paper: Coecobrya lanna sp. nov., Coecobrya tukmeas sp. nov. and Coecobrya aokii (Yoshii, 1995). Additional details are provided for three other species Coecobrya guanophila Deharveng, 1990, Coecobrya similis Deharveng, 1990 and Coecobrya tenebricosa (Folsom, 1902). Complete S-chaetotaxy of the dorsal tergites is illustrated for the first time in the genus. Sinella ciliata Denis, 1932 is synonymized with C. tenebricosa. A key to the world species of Coecobrya is given.
