birds. However, migratory species tend to differentiate less because increased movements often preclude the extended periods of allopatry thought to be required for speciation. This interaction of isolation and migration&ndash;gene flow is a complex issue in evolutionary biology. We examined the genetics of divergence in Northern Saw-whet Owls (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Aegolius acadicus</named-content></italic>), in which a migratory form (<italic>A. a. acadicus</italic>) occurs during fall migration and winter, but not at other times of the year, in the range of a sedentary, island form (<italic>A. a. brooksi</italic>) on Haida Gwaii, British Columbia. We used 2,018 base pairs of mtDNA and genomic data from 405 amplified fragment-length polymorphisms to assess the population genetics and evolutionary history of these two subspecies. Both mtDNA and nuclear genomic markers showed significant divergence between these subspecies, and mtDNA gene flow between them was very low (&lt;1 individual generation<sup>&minus;1</sup>). These subspecies likely diverged in association with the Wisconsin glacial maximum, &sim;16,000 yr BP. The refugial history of the region, life-history traits, and the maintenance of lineage integrity despite current contact suggest that this divergence occurred or is maintained through heteropatric differentiation, probably driven by a loss of migratory behavior in <italic>brooksi</italic> accompanied by local adaptations.La diferenciaci&oacute;n, que frecuentemente resulta en especiaci&oacute;n, es com&uacute;n entre poblaciones isle&ntilde;as de aves. Sin embargo, las species migratorias tienden a diferenciarse menos porque sus movimientos excluyen periodos prolongados de alopatr&iacute;a, los cuales se consideran necesarios para la especiaci&oacute;n. Esta interacci&oacute;n entre aislamiento y migraci&oacute;n/flujo gen&eacute;tico es un tema complejo en la biolog&iacute;a evolutiva. Examinamos la gen&eacute;tica de divergencia en <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Aegolius acadicus</named-content></italic>, en el cual ocurre una forma migratoria (<italic>A. a. acadicus</italic>) durante el oto&ntilde;o e invierno, pero no durante otras &eacute;pocas del a&ntilde;o, dentro del rango de distribuci&oacute;n de una forma sedentaria isle&ntilde;a (<italic>A. a. brooksi</italic>) en Haida Gwaii, British Columbia. Usamos 2018 pb de ADN mitocondrial (ADNmt) y datos gen&oacute;micos de 405 polimorfismos de longitud de fragmentos amplificados (AFLPs) para evaluar la gen&eacute;tica poblacional y la historia evolutiva de estas dos subespecies. Tanto el ADNmt como los marcadores gen&oacute;micos nucleares mostraron divergencia significativa entre las subspecies, y el flujo de ADNmt entre ellas fue muy bajo (&lt;1 individuo por generaci&oacute;n). Estas subespecies probablemente divergieron con el m&aacute;ximo glacial de Wisconsin, hace &sim;16,000 a&ntilde;os. La historia refugial de la regi&oacute;n, caracter&iacute;stias de historia de vida, y el mantenimiento de integridad de linaje pese a contacto actual sugieren que esta divergencia occuri&oacute; y es mantenida por diferenciaci&oacute;n heterop&aacute;trica, probablemente causada por una p&eacute;rdida de comportamiento migratorio en brooksi acompa&ntilde;ado por adaptaciones locales.<italic>Palabras claves:</italic> ADNmt, AFLPs, especiaci&oacute;n, genetica de poblaciones, migraci&oacute;nThe repeated cycles of glaciation at high latitudes during the Quaternary are thought to have caused diversification in many taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Hewitt1">Hewitt 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Hewitt2">2000</xref>). The genetic effects of this history have been studied in diverse life forms, using several molecular markers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Taberlet1">Taberlet et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Shafer1">Shafer et al. 2010</xref>). Many of these studies have found evidence of isolation during Pleistocene glacial cycles, and allopatric diversification is often thought to be the main route of divergence and speciation in birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Mayr1">Mayr 1963</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Coyne1">Coyne and Orr 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Price1">Price 2008</xref>). Recently, some speciation research has focused on the importance of attributes other than geography in the process of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Gavrilets1">Gavrilets 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Butlin1">Butlin et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Crispo1">Crispo 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Li1">Li et al. 2010</xref>). Behavioral, ecological, and environmental differences between populations are increasingly seen as important drivers of divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Schluter1">Schluter 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-McKinnon1">McKinnon et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Ruegg1">Ruegg et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Verzijden1">Verzijden et al. 2012</xref>), and all of them can operate within each category of the geographic models of speciation (allopatric, parapatric, and sympatric; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Gavrilets1">Gavrilets 2003</xref>). A recent refinement of geographic context is heteropatric speciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Winker1">Winker 2010</xref>), a type of parapatric speciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Gavrilets1">Gavrilets 2003</xref>) in which diverging migratory organisms occur in allopatry and sympatry cyclically through an annual cycle yet undergo divergence through a type of ecological speciation, often with some gene flow. This type of speciation requires relatively strong divergent selection to cause and maintain lineage divergence in the presence of gene flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Nosil1">Nosil et al. 2009</xref>). Populations that occur in heteropatry often have an opportunity for gene flow (e.g., stop and mate), yet many diverge nonetheless; we can thus infer that divergent selection is operating, probably through ecological adaptations for exploitation of resources that are available cyclically and that are heterogeneously distributed in space and time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Winker1">Winker 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Winker2">Winker et al. 2013</xref>). Accurately assessing the main drivers of historical (and contemporary) divergence is a very complex task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Coyne1">Coyne and Orr 2004</xref>), stemming both from an inability to know that strict allopatry did not occur at some critical historical point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Mayr2">Mayr 1982</xref>) and from difficulties in reconstructing temporal aspects of gene flow (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Becquet1">Becquet and Przeworski 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Strasburg1">Strasburg and Rieseberg 2011</xref>). The most productive avenues of research will use a holistic approach, incorporating all available evidence to shed light on the mechanisms that promote and maintain divergence. Here, we use such an approach to better understand divergence between a pair of lineages with a heteropatric distribution.Throughout most of their range, Northern Saw-whet Owls (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Aegolius acadicus</named-content></italic>) do not vary significantly in size or coloration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Rasmussen1">Rasmussen et al. 2008</xref>). <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Aegolius acadicus</named-content> brooksi</italic>, the population on Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Islands), British Columbia, Canada, is an example of a resident endemic subspecies that has undergone differentiation from its mainland counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Fleming1">Fleming 1916</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-f01">Figure 1</xref>). The other subspecies, <italic>A. a. acadicus</italic>, occupies the mainland range. Like other taxa that are distributed heteropatrically, these two subspecies do not exhibit multigenerational spatial isolation, which is a key component of the allopatric speciation model. The nominate subspecies (<italic>A. a. acadicus</italic>) occurs on Haida Gwaii in small numbers during fall migration and winter (e.g., 7 of 115&plus; specimens from Haida Gwaii, spanning dates October 12 to January 11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Sealy1">Sealy 1998</xref>, University of Alaska Museum specimens), but these birds are not known to breed there. The breeding seasons of Haida Gwaii and mainland owls do not appear to differ significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Campbell2">Campbell et al. 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Cannings1">Cannings 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-COSEWIC1">COSEWIC 2006</xref>).

The Haida Gwaii area, in particular, is thought to have been a refugium during the last glacial maximum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Warner1">Warner et al. 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Heusser1">Heusser 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Pielou1">Pielou 1991</xref>).

Birds, in particular, have been shown to exhibit genetic differentiation consistent with a refugial history there (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Burg1">Burg et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Burg2">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Pruett2">Pruett and Winker 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Topp2">Topp and Winker 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Pruett1">Pruett et al. 2013</xref>), although some differentiation may have occurred after glaciers receded (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Bull1">Bull et al. 2010</xref>).Currently, Hecate Strait separates Haida Gwaii from the nearest mainland by &sim;70 km. Historical isolation distances between these islands and the mainland are unknown, but the migratory capacity of many bird species and the glacial history of northwestern North America suggest that a Haida Gwaii refugium was probably no more removed from other habitable areas than is seen today. We cannot definitively reconstruct the historical biogeography between these two lineages (i.e. were they at one time entirely allopatric and now exhibit secondary contact, or have they existed in heteropatry since they began to split?). However, we can study them as a contemporarily heteropatric pair of lineages and ask a series of questions to determine the evolutionary history of <italic>brooksi</italic> in relation to nominate <italic>acadicus</italic>. (1) These taxa (subspecies) are morphologically distinct, but is there significant genetic differentiation? (2) How does their divergence date correspond with the past climatic history of the area? (3) Is there evidence of gene flow and, if so, at what level? (4) Is there evidence of selection among sampled loci? And (5) although we cannot explicitly test models of speciation in this system, we synthesize the available evidence and consider the possible modes of divergence that likely drove this case of differentiation.Tissue samples from 51 individuals were obtained from the collections of the University of Alaska Museum and the University of Washington Burke Museum. Study-skin vouchers are at these institutions and at the Queen Charlotte Islands Museum and University of Manitoba Zoology Museum (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-t01">Table 1</xref>).We amplified 1,047 base pairs (bp) of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) gene for <italic>acadicus</italic> (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 19 individuals) and <italic>brooksi</italic> (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 24); one additional <italic>acadicus</italic> sequence was obtained from GenBank (EU601051; <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-t01">Table 1</xref>).

These internal primers were as follows: cyt <italic>b</italic> internal forward primer (5&prime;-TTCTCAGCCGTACCATACATTGGC-3&prime;), cyt <italic>b</italic> internal reverse primer (5&prime;-ATCACAGCTGGATGGGATTCCT-3&prime;), ND2 internal forward primer (5&prime;-TCTTGCCTCCTCCTAACAACAGCA-3&prime;), and ND2 internal reverse primer (5&prime;-TGTTGATAGGATGGCCATGGAGGT-3&prime;). Sequences were aligned and edited using Sequencher version 4.7 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA).Amplified fragment-length polymorphisms (AFLPs) were generated using a protocol modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Vos1">Vos et al. (1995</xref>). These were generated for 24 <italic>brooksi</italic> and 22 <italic>acadicus</italic> from throughout the species' range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-f02">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-t01">Table 1</xref>). Initial sample DNA concentration was quantified on a spectrophotometer; all samples had concentrations of 30&ndash;70 ng &mu;L<sup>&minus;1</sup>. The restriction digestion and ligation of adapter pairs were performed in one step at 37&deg;C for &sim;12 hr. This reaction mixture was subsequently diluted with 94.5 &mu;L of 0.1M TE buffer and frozen until preselective amplification. Preselective amplification was done using standard protocols with an annealing temperature of 56&deg;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Withrow1">Withrow 2013</xref>). After preselective amplification, reactions were diluted with 80 &mu;L of 0.1&times; TE buffer and frozen until selective amplification. Selective amplifications used the same PCR regime as before, but nine primer&ndash;pair combinations of dye-labeled <italic>MseI</italic> and <italic>EcoRI</italic> primers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-t02">Table 2</xref>) were used to selectively amplify a subset of DNA. Thermal-cycler regime consisted of 2 min at 94&deg;C followed by 11 cycles of 94&deg;C for 20 s, 66&deg;C for 30 s, and 72&deg;C for 2 min. During each cycle the annealing temperature was dropped by 1&deg;C; at 56&deg;C, 19 additional cycles were run at that annealing temperature followed by 30 min at 60&deg;C. Samples were run on an ABI 3100 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems).GeneMapper version 3.7 (Applied Biosystems) was used to score the chromatograms. Only unambiguous loci with clean, well-defined peaks were scored. We used a minimum peak width of 1.5 bp and a minimum peak height of 75 as a starting point, but then examined each peak individually to maximize the useful phylogenetic signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Holland1">Holland et al. 2008</xref>). In a similar study, a genotyping error rate of &lt;1&percnt; was estimated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Withrow1">Withrow 2013</xref>), a rate generally considered not to result in inaccurate inferences of phylogeographic pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Zhang1">Zhang and Hare 2012</xref>). We discarded two <italic>brooksi</italic> samples that did not amplify larger fragments, likely because of tissue degradation related to the salvaged nature of these specimens. Data were transformed into a binary state (presence&ndash;absence) matrix using a Microsoft Excel macro, which also transformed the matrix into nexus format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Rinehart1">Rinehart 2004</xref>). All bands were considered independent, homologous loci.A median joining network illustrating haplotype frequencies of mtDNA was generated using Network version 4.6.0.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Bandelt1">Bandelt et al. 1999</xref>). We used Arlequin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Excoffier1">Excoffier et al. 1992</xref>) to calculate pairwise &Phi;<sub>ST</sub> values between subspecies for cyt <italic>b</italic> and ND2 sequences separately and for a combined mtDNA dataset.

Preliminary runs indicated that a burn-in of 20,000 iterations was sufficient. We then ran three independent simulations, using the admixture model, for 100,000 iterations for values of (<italic>K</italic>) from 1 to 5. The likelihood of <italic>K</italic> given the data was calculated as P(<italic>K&verbar;X</italic>). To avoid biasing the inference of population structure, we did not use subspecies origin information, although all individuals were phenotypically identifiable. We used the program Distruct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Rosenberg1">Rosenberg et al. 2002</xref>) to transform and apply information from a representative run of the most likely number of <italic>K</italic> into a postscript file that was viewed and manipulated in Adobe Illustrator.

Because the timing of divergence was unknown, the HKY model of molecular evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Hasegawa1">Hasegawa et al. 1985</xref>) was used in all runs to account for multiple nucleotide substitutions at the same position, nucleotide frequency differences, and any transition&ndash;transversion bias as recommended in IM documentation. ModelTest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Posada1">Posada and Crandall 1998</xref>) did not rule out the HKY model as appropriate in this dataset. Each run proceeded for &gt;10 million updates to achieve a minimum effective sample size of 100 for any given parameter estimate; most were several orders of magnitude higher than this. Results from the three runs were similar, and we report here only the parameters estimated in the longest run of 30,002,974 updates after burn-in.The parameters estimated by IM are dependent on the mutation rate, which is an uncertain quantity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Lovette1">Lovette 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Ho2">Ho et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Ho1">2011</xref>). A mutation rate of 2&percnt; divergence Ma<sup>&minus;1</sup> (0.00002018/yr/2,018 bp) was used (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Weir2">Weir and Schluter 2008</xref>). We also set a range of mutation rates at 1&ndash;4&percnt; divergence Ma<sup>&minus;1</sup> (0.00001&ndash;0.00004/yr/2,018 bp) to set priors on the mutation rate. This range was also used to calculate a range of demographic parameter values because mutation rates are uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Weir2">Weir and Schluter 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Ho1">Ho et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Pacheco1">Pacheco et al. 2011</xref>).We used DNAsp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Rozas1">Rozas et al. 2003</xref>) on mtDNA data to calculate haplotype diversity (<italic>H</italic><sub>d</sub>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Nei2">Nei and Chesser 1983</xref>) and nucleotide diversity (&pi;). We conducted chi-square tests of genetic differentiation between subspecies based on haplotype frequencies and nucleotide diversity indices. The chi-square tests with Yates continuity corrections were conducted in PopTools version 2.6.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Hood1">Hood 2005</xref>), an add-in for Microsoft Excel.Because heteropatric speciation requires divergent selection to occur, we sought evidence for selection in the AFLP data (though given the size of the genome in relation to our dataset, an absence of evidence for selection would not be surprising). To determine whether the genes sampled through AFLPs diverged via genetic drift or selection, we compared <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> and heterozygosity estimates for each locus in our dataset with a simulated dataset acting under drift alone, using an infinite-alleles model. To produce these simulated data, we used the program fdist2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Beaumont1">Beaumont and Nichols 1996</xref>), which uses an average divergence of <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> and expected heterozygosity (<italic>H</italic><sub>S</sub>) to simulate the expected distribution of differentiation across loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Campbell1">Campbell and Bernatchez 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Bonin1">Bonin et al. 2006</xref>). It uses an <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> calculated by the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Nei1">Nei (1977</xref>) as modified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Nei2">Nei and Chesser (1983</xref>) and generates a uniform distribution of heterozygosities in place of a specified mutation rate. This distribution was then used to calculate quantiles of the median and upper and lower 99&percnt; confidence intervals of the distribution of loci for the population diverging under drift alone. The program also calculates <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> and <italic>H</italic><sub>S</sub> for all polymorphic loci in the dataset, which were then plotted against the confidence intervals. Loci falling outside this distribution in excess of expected false positives are assumed to be under selection or closely linked to loci under selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Beaumont1">Beaumont and Nichols 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Nosil1">Nosil et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Flaxman1">Flaxman et al. 2012</xref>). The data were analyzed to obtain an estimate of the average <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> across all loci. The model was then fit to this <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> for simulation. We ran the simulation for 20,000 realizations, with two demes total, sampling the two subspecies of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. acadicus</named-content></italic> with an expected <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> &equals; 0.11 and an average sample size per subspecies of 22 individuals.Haplotype networks of both ND2 and cyt <italic>b</italic> showed some structuring between subspecies. Interestingly, with only three haplotypes, cyt <italic>b</italic> still exhibited a fixed difference between the subspecies, with two haplotypes occurring in the larger <italic>acadicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-f03">Figure 3</xref>). ND2 was less structured, with most individuals sharing a single common haplotype. Of the eight ND2 haplotypes, three occurred in <italic>brooksi</italic> and six in <italic>acadicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-f03">Figure 3</xref>).Population structuring in mtDNA was apparent in both genes separately and together, with &Phi;<sub>ST</sub> for cyt <italic>b</italic> &equals; 0.96 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), &Phi;<sub>ST</sub> for ND2 &equals; 0.67 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), and a combined &Phi;<sub>ST</sub> &equals; 0.67 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). These are consistent with, and reinforce, the significant structure seen visually in the haplotype networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-f03">Figure 3</xref>). The AFLP data also showed significant structure between the subspecies, with <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> <italic>&equals;</italic> 0.074 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001).The STRUCTURE analysis estimated that the most likely number of populations involved was two (ln P(<italic>X</italic>&verbar;<italic>K</italic>) &equals; &minus;1,438.4; P(<italic>K</italic>&verbar;<italic>X</italic>) &equals; &sim;1; <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-t03">Table 3</xref>).

Three (of 24; 12.5&percnt;) Haida Gwaii birds had &gt;50&percnt; of their membership coefficients estimated to originate from <italic>acadicus</italic>, and two (of 22; 9.0&percnt;) mainland birds had more than half of their membership coefficients estimated to come from <italic>brooksi</italic>.

Six (25&percnt;) Haida Gwaii birds had &gt;10&percnt; of membership coefficients estimated to come from <italic>acadicus</italic>, whereas four (18&percnt;) mainland birds had similar estimates of membership coefficients matching <italic>brooksi</italic>.The BAPS analysis also estimated the most likely number of populations to be two (ln Pr(<italic>K</italic>&verbar;<italic>X</italic>) &equals; &minus;1,631.1; <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-t03">Table 3</xref>), and identified the same individuals as being genomically admixed in the same proportions as STRUCTURE (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-t03">Table 3</xref>; individual data not shown).Each of three replicate but independent coalescent analyses in IM produced similar results.

Coalescent analysis in IM estimated the high point (and 95&percnt; HPD) of the probability distribution for the following model parameters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-t04">Table 4</xref>): effective female population size of <italic>brooksi</italic> (&theta;<sub>1</sub>) &equals; 0.35 (0.65&ndash;96.15), effective female population size of <italic>acadicus</italic> (&theta;<sub>2</sub>) &equals; 60.75 (8.45&ndash;97.75), effective ancestral female population size (&theta;<sub>a</sub>) &equals; 0.05 (0.05&ndash;38.85), migrants from <italic>acadicus</italic> into <italic>brooksi</italic> (<italic>m</italic><sub>1</sub>) &equals; 0.0015 (0.017&ndash;2.520), migrants from <italic>brooksi</italic> into <italic>acadicus</italic> (<italic>m</italic><sub>2</sub>) &equals; 0.0045 (0.017&ndash;2.630), divergence time (<italic>t</italic>) &equals; 0.33 (0.14&ndash;3.29), and the proportion of the ancestral population that gave rise to <italic>brooksi</italic> (<italic>s</italic>) &equals; 0.0005 (0.0025&ndash;0.9700). We converted these values into demographic units using a divergence rate of 2&percnt; Ma<sup>&minus;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-t04">Table 4</xref>).

At a 4&percnt; divergence rate, <italic>t</italic> &equals; 8,187 yr BP, and at 1&percnt; <italic>t</italic> &equals; 32,750 yr BP. The effective population size of <italic>acadicus</italic> (&theta;<sub>2</sub>; 250,867 females) did not converge well, likely because of its extremely large size in relation to <italic>brooksi</italic> and inadequate signal in the dataset for an accurate estimate.

Estimates of mtDNA migration rates in both directions peaked at zero (these are not affected by mutation rate; <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-t04">Table 4</xref>), substantially lower than would be predicted by random mating in a population on Haida Gwaii comprising &sim;6.5&percnt; nominate <italic>acadicus</italic> (given that 7 of &sim;115 modern specimens from the island are by plumage <italic>acadicus</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Sealy1">Sealy 1998</xref>, University of Alaska Museum specimens). The proportion of the ancestral population founding <italic>brooksi</italic> was estimated to be very small (<italic>s</italic> &equals; 0.05&percnt;).Nucleotide diversity was lower in <italic>brooksi</italic> than in <italic>acadicus</italic> (&pi; &equals; 0.00008 and 0.00039, respectively; &chi;<sup>2</sup> &equals; 2342.8, df &equals; 1, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), but haplotype diversity was not significantly different between the two taxa (<italic>brooksi</italic>, <italic>H</italic><sub>d</sub> &equals; 0.163; <italic>acadicus</italic>, <italic>H</italic><sub>d</sub> &equals; 0.538; &chi;<sup>2</sup> &equals; 2.1, df &equals; 9, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.144).The nine primer pairs produced 405 AFLP loci. Of these, 102 (25.2&percnt;) were polymorphic (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-t02">Table 2</xref>) when both subspecies were included. There were 19 AFLP loci that were fixed in <italic>brooksi</italic> but polymorphic in <italic>acadicus</italic>, and there were 23 loci fixed in <italic>acadicus</italic> but polymorphic in <italic>brooksi</italic>; these differences were not significant (&chi;<sup>2</sup> &equals; 0.0477, df &equals; 2, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.977). There were six AFLP loci present in <italic>brooksi</italic> that were absent in <italic>acadicus</italic>, and seven loci present in <italic>acadicus</italic> that were absent in <italic>brooksi</italic>, and these differences also were not significant (&chi;<sup>2</sup> &equals; 0.844, df &equals; 2, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.981).One of 405 loci (0.25&percnt;) fell outside the simulated dataset's 99&percnt; quantile (data not shown). This result includes fewer loci than would be expected by chance (expected <italic>n</italic> &equals; 4; 1&percnt;), which suggests that these two populations are probably not experiencing strong divergent selection at the loci examined.These owl subspecies exhibit significant genetic differentiation and low gene flow despite their occurrence today in heteropatry. This reinforces the validity of the phenotypically well-defined <italic>brooksi</italic> subspecies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-f01">Figure 1</xref>). Our analyses of mtDNA data suggest that there is effectively no gene flow between populations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-t04">Table 4</xref>). By contrast, Bayesian clustering analyses of AFLP data suggested nuclear allele sharing between populations in some individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-f04">Figure 4</xref>). The nature of AFLP data precludes us from determining whether these alleles are a result of incomplete lineage sorting or ongoing gene flow. (No test for gene flow in AFLP data exists.) Most birds, including owls, have female-biased dispersal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Konig1">K&ouml;nig et al. 2009</xref>), and <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. acadicus</named-content></italic>, in particular, appears to fit this pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Beckett1">Beckett and Proudfoot 2012</xref>). Nominate <italic>acadicus</italic> may also be nomadic to some extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Marks1">Marks and Doremus 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Bowman1">Bowman et al. 2010</xref>). We therefore expect mtDNA to be a leading indicator of gene flow in this species. Thus, the very low estimates of gene flow seen in maternally inherited mtDNA (effectively zero), coupled with the shallow level of divergence observed, suggest that the shared nuclear alleles are due to incomplete lineage sorting rather than gene flow. This is a pattern similar to that seen between Snow and McKay's buntings (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Plectrophenax nivalis</named-content></italic> and <italic>P. hyperboreus</italic>), another case of island differentiation, in which mtDNA suggested that no gene flow was occurring, but in which AFLP markers showed a sharing of some nuclear alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Maley1">Maley and Winker 2010</xref>).The IM simulations estimated a divergence date of &sim;16,000 yr BP (though confidence intervals are broad; <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-t04">Table 4</xref>), which was about the time of the oldest known evidence for a terrestrial environment on Haida Gwaii (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Warner1">Warner et al. 1982</xref>), at or just after the maximum extent of late Wisconsin glacial extent in the area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Clague1">Clague and James 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Clark1">Clark et al. 2009</xref>). However, other genetic data suggest a deeper forested refugial history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Pruett1">Pruett et al. 2013</xref>). Uncertainties about substitution rates make precise estimates of divergence dates from a single molecular marker difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Ho2">Ho et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Ho1">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Price1">Price 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Tinn1">Tinn and Oakley 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, our estimate of their divergence peaked sharply at a time corresponding reasonably well with the last glacial maximum of the Pleistocene, and mutation rates of 1&ndash;4&percnt; Ma<sup>&minus;1</sup> did not change this association, which makes <italic>brooksi</italic> a relatively recently derived taxon. Whether these owls were isolated on the current Haida Gwaii archipelago as glaciers retreated after the last glacial maximum or occupied a nearby refugium is uncertain.Evidence also exists for a small effective population size and a possible founder effect in <italic>brooksi</italic>. Population size estimates for <italic>brooksi</italic> (1,445 females) and <italic>acadicus</italic> (250,867 females) correspond well with the current census size estimates of 1,900 individual <italic>brooksi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-COSEWIC1">COSEWIC 2006</xref>) and 100,000&ndash;300,000 individual <italic>acadicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Rasmussen1">Rasmussen et al. 2008</xref>).We did not find evidence of selection in our sample of nuclear loci, so our dataset suggests that drift has been important. Our sampling of the genome was small, however (405 loci, compared with &sim;20,000 genes in the chicken genome; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Hillier1">Hillier et al. 2004</xref>), so selection may not be absent. In fact, given differences in plumage, migration, and diet, the existence of some divergent selection may be inferred, though whether drift may also have affected these phenotypic traits is unknown.Glaciation, tectonic rebound, and fluctuating sea levels make geological inferences of historical refugia complex, but much of the continental shelf of south coastal Alaska and coastal British Columbia north and south of Haida Gwaii remained ice free during the last glacial maximum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Hetherington1">Hetherington et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Kaufman1">Kaufman and Manley 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Carrara1">Carrara et al. 2007</xref>). Haida Gwaii may even have been connected to the mainland briefly, 10,000 to 11,000 yr BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Hetherington1">Hetherington et al. 2003</xref>). Thus, a string of refugia along northwestern North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Shafer1">Shafer et al. 2010</xref>) likely existed, with Haida Gwaii only one of several ice-free areas. Therefore, we do not suggest that <italic>brooksi</italic> necessarily arose on Haida Gwaii, but rather that it arose in an unglaciated area in the region and likely shifted its range as sea levels rose and suitable habitats shifted.Today, why do migrant mainland <italic>acadicus</italic> apparently not stop, overwinter, and mate with the <italic>brooksi</italic> population in a part of the <italic>acadicus</italic> range that is suitable, at least at the species level, for both wintering and breeding? Given this contemporary situation, our results showing genetic differentiation and low gene flow suggest that key aspects of the heteropatric speciation model are at least maintaining the distinctiveness and low gene flow between these two lineages. The heteropatric speciation model, like most speciation models, makes two key predictions when comparing two diverged or diverging lineages: Significant genetic differentiation will be present, and gene flow will be low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Winker1">Winker 2010</xref>). The allopatric speciation process predicts the former, but not necessarily the latter&mdash;secondary contact often results in considerable gene flow. Clearly determining the historical condition between these owl lineages (i.e. allopatry followed by secondary contact versus long-term heteropatry) is not possible at present (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Becquet1">Becquet and Przeworski 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Strasburg1">Strasburg and Rieseberg 2011</xref>). However, classic allopatric divergence, although possible, may not be the most parsimonious model responsible for the existence of the current differentiation. Instead, the heteropatric model may apply historically as well.A migratory <italic>Aegolius</italic> ancestor could well have used this coastal refugial region just as nominate <italic>acadicus</italic> does today. The ability of <italic>Aegolius</italic> to colonize areas much more remote than a Haida Gwaii refugium is highlighted by the extinct <italic>A. gradyi</italic> from Bermuda, a close relative of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. acadicus</named-content></italic>, which likely arose by peripatric speciation (a type of allopatric speciation) after an ancestral <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. acadicus</named-content></italic> reached that island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Olson1">Olson 2012</xref>). A species with the high dispersal capability of <italic>acadicus</italic> likely would not have been absent from a Haida Gwaii refugium long enough for extended periods of multigenerational allopatry to occur. Current geographic and life-history characteristics thus suggest a process of heteropatric divergence. Alternatively, as an island form, <italic>brooksi</italic> may have arisen through allopatric isolation (or through peripatric speciation) and retains its distinctive genetic and phenotypic attributes despite secondary contact with nominate <italic>acadicus</italic>. However, secondary contact zones of taxa that diverged via allopatry often exhibit more pronounced hybridization than seen here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Coyne1">Coyne and Orr 2004</xref>), a common phenomenon among birds in the Pacific Northwest, including <italic>Setophaga townsendi</italic> and <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. occidentalis</named-content></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Krosby1">Krosby and Rohwer 2010</xref>), <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Larus occidentalis</named-content></italic> and <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. glaucescens</named-content></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Hoffman1">Hoffman et al. 1978</xref>), <italic>Trogolodytes pacificus</italic> and <italic>T. hiemalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Toews1">Toews and Irwin 2008</xref>), <italic>Setophaga coronata</italic> subspecies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Mila1">Mil&aacute; et al. 2007</xref>), <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Picoides villosus</named-content></italic> subspecies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Klicka1">Klicka et al. 2011</xref>), <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Catharus ustulatus</named-content></italic> subspecies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Ruegg1">Ruegg et al. 2012</xref>), and <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. guttatus</named-content></italic> subspecies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-1-73-Topp1">Topp et al. 2013</xref>). Even if allopatry was the main driver of divergence in these owls, mechanisms of heteropatric differentiation could still have acted to maintain differences acquired largely in allopatry and may explain why we apparently do not see reticulation of these lineages despite opportunities for <italic>acadicus</italic> to stop and mate. However, we cannot distinguish between historical scenarios of allopatric or heteropatric divergence using only our genetic data.We consider it likely that the Haida Gwaii refugium was accessible and accessed by ancestral continental <italic>acadicus</italic> while a sedentary population was established and began diverging. It is possible, however, that continental ice sheets contributed to lowering the number of continental immigrants while strong divergent selection occurred, creating sufficient isolating mechanisms that when the degree of heteropatry increased to the level observed today (there is, after all, a large continental population in the region that could have been present on Haida Gwaii during the last glacial maximum), lineage integrity was maintained. Further study of nuclear gene flow is warranted.This work was supported by the University of Alaska Museum; Friends of Ornithology; a University of Alaska EPSCoR fellowship; the W.
