In summary, we have shown that all four species of bat may indeed be confined to the forested environments of tropical South America and that their current distribution is not the product of sampling deficiencies, except possibly in one case. It seems likely that the present disjunct distribution of all four species is the product of the loss of a dispersal corridor that connected the Amazon and Atlantic forests no later than the Plio–Pleistocene. While the exact timing of this process and the dispersal routes of these clades have yet to be defined, the results of the present study provide important insights into the history of faunal interchange–specifically of chiropterans–between forested South American biomes.
