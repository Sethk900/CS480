A new species of Ameroseius Berlese from Brazil, redescriptions of Ameroseius plumosus (Oudemans) and Ameroseius plumigera (Oudemans) (Acari: Mesostigmata: Ameroseiidae) based on the examination of type materialAmeroseius Berlese is the most numerous genus of family Ameroseiidae Evans (in Hughes 1961). Species of this genus have been reported from many regions around the world. A few species of this genus are known from Brazil. Ameroseius mineiro Narita, Bernardi and Moraes, sp. nov. is described based on the morphology of adult females and males collected from guano in caves of Minas Gerais State, Brazil. This is the second Ameroseius species described from Brazil. The holotypes of Ameroseius plumosus (Oudemans) and Ameroseius plumigera (Oudemans) were examined, given their close similarity with the species described in this paper, and they are here redescribed. A key is provided to separate these and other most similar species. http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:17A7D831-EC49-4D65-B06B-5E13EF52C696
