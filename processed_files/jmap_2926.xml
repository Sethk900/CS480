Effects of grazing practices and fossorial rodents on a winter avian community in Chihuahua, MexicoChihuahuan Desert grasslands are important wintering grounds for grassland and shrub-adapted birds. Many species belonging to these assemblages are currently exhibiting population declines. One area recognized for its importance to biological diversity, including grassland birds, is the Janos-Nuevo Casas Grandes black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) complex in northwestern Chihuahua, Mexico, an area containing 58 colonies with 30,000 ha of prairie dogs. This is one of the largest remaining prairie dog complexes and the only intact complex in the Chihuahuan Desert. In its current condition, a large percentage of this complex is of reduced value to wildlife. Overgrazing on communal (ejido) lands has resulted in areas being comprised of annual grasses and forbs. The density of active prairie dog burrows and banner-tailed kangaroo rat (Dipodomys spectabilis) mounds as well as avian diversity and abundance were lower on ejido lands than an adjacent private ranchland with and without prairie dogs. Few avian species used overgrazed portions of the prairie dog colony. Community similarity among plot types was low due to different management practices and differences on and off colony. To retain, and in many instances restore the biological diversity of this important region it is essential to work with local ejidos on grazing management. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
