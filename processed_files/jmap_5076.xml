The systematic position of the tribe Stenodemini (Heteroptera: Cimicomorpha: Miridae: Mirinae) in the light of the male internal reproductive systemThe study focuses on the morphology and ultrastructure of the male reproductive system of 13 Hemiptera species representing the tribes Stenodemini and Pithanini: Acetropis carinata, Dolichomiris linearis, Leptopterna dolabrata, L. ferrugata, Megaloceroea recticornis, Notostira elongata, N. erratica, Stenodema (Brachystira) calcarata, Stenodema (Stenodema) holsata, S. (S.) laevigata, Trigonotylus caelestialium, T. pulchellus and Myrmecoris gracilis. The study also embraces three species which belong to the tribe Mirini, and play the role of an out-group in the conducted analyses. These species are: Adelphocoris seticornis, Calocoris affinis and Lygus rugulipennis. On the basis of total preparations, cross and longitudinal sections, we have studied the number of testicular follicles, their dimensions, types of connections between follicles and vas deferens, the structure of vasa deferentia, as well as the number, structure and origin of accessory glands. The above-listed features have provided complementary information, alongside morphological features, helpful in verifying the taxonomic position of the tribe Stenodemini.
