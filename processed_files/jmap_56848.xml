Spatial variability of soil phosphorus in the Fribourg canton, SwitzerlandPhosphorus (P) is the second essential nutrient for plant growth but can become an ecological and economical concern in case of over-fertilization. Soil P dynamic is influenced by many parameters like soil physical–chemical properties and farming practices. A better understanding of the factors controlling its distribution is required to achieve best management of P in cropping systems. In Switzerland, the FRIBO network was launched in 1987 and consists of 250 sites covering a wide diversity of soils (Cambisols, Gleysols, Rendzinas, Lithosols, Luvisols, Fluvisols) and three different land uses (cropland, grassland and mountain pasture) across the Fribourg canton. A spatial investigation of the different P forms (total, organic and available) for the FRIBO network led to the following main conclusions:  (i) The P status in agricultural soils was significantly different among the three land uses encountered, with the highest mean values of available P found in croplands, from 2.12 (CO2 saturated water extraction) to 81.3 mg.kg− 1 (acetate ammonium + EDTA extraction); whereas total P was more abundant in permanent grasslands (1186 mg.kg− 1), followed by mountain pastures (1039 mg.kg− 1) and croplands (935 mg.kg− 1). This full characterization of the soil P status provides important data on P distribution related to soil properties and land use. (ii) Environmental variables such as altitude, slope, wetness index or plan curvature, derived from the digital elevation model (DEM) only explained a small part of the spatial variation of the different P forms (20 to 25%). Thus, the geostatistical analyses revealed that land use plays a significant role in soil P distribution. Improved predictions of the spatial distribution of P-related forms at landscape scales are needed and would require additional data points and variables such as parent material, soil types and terrain attributes.
