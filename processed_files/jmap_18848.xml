Soil respiration 1 year after sewage sludge applicationThe residual effect of sewage sludge application on soil respiration of field plots at the Arazuri Research Station (Navarra, Spain) was investigated. Plots amended with sewage sludge or left unamended were used to measure soil respiration after 1 year using a portable infrared analyzer. Soil respiration was greater in soils that received 80 Mg ha(-1) of sewage sludge 1 year prior to the study than in unamended soils. Soils that received 40 Mg ha(-1) of sewage sludge respired more than unamended soils on only two sampling dates, probably because soil temperature and water content favored high microbial activity. These results show that, 1 year after: sludge amendment, soil respiration still depends on sludge application rate. Care should be taken when collecting the measurements as they are greatly influenced by temperature and moisture conditions.
