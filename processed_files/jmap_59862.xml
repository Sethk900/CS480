Application of Statistical Process Control for Structural Health Monitoring of a Historic BuildingAbstractThe authors apply a statistical process control framework to support structural health monitoring of the Grace Church building in Charleston, South Carolina. Specifically, they conduct a post-hoc analysis of displacement data acquired via remote monitoring of delamination between two wythes of brick in a clerestory wall. The framework consists of formulation and estimation of statistical models to explain the progression of the measurements under ordinary conditions and use of control charts to detect unusual events. One such event was excessive displacement in September 2011 that led the engineer of record to close the building to public access and order immediate repairs. The analysis also reveals a few unusual events that were not apparent from visual interpretation of the data, including a possible precursor to the aforementioned event.
