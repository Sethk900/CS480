Relations between activity temperature and preferred temperature of Liolaemus nitidus in central Chile (Lacertilia: Iguanidae)Temperature preferences of lizards in the field and in laboratory conditions have been the subject of an increasing amount of study since the publication of Cowles and Bogert (1944). From this date on, the accumulated data have been reviewed by Bogert (1949), Heath (1964), and Brattstrom (1965), among others. More recently, Dawson (1975) synthesized the available information and discussed the physiological mechanisms involved in temperature regulation, as well as the theoretical implications of thermal relations in lizards. Huey and Slatkin (1976) have designed cost-benefit models to account for differences between physiological and ecological optimal temperatures. Most of the published information regards lizard species from North, Central, and tropical South America, a few from Australia, and the least from temperate South America (Pearson, 1954; Huey, 1974). Only recently, Fuentes and Jaksic (1979) have documented the mean field activity temperatures of eight Liolaemus species of central Chile. Hence, we were interested to know if Liolaemus lizards maintain similar body temperatures, whether in the field or in laboratory conditions. In order to test the hypothesis that activity body temperature is not significantly different from preferred body temperature in the laboratory, we compared data obtained from a common Liolaemus species of central Chile: L. nitidus (see Donoso-Barros, 1966). Ecological observations about this lizard have been reported by Jaksic and Fuentes (1980).
