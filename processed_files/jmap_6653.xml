Effects of plant density and row spacing on Lupiniis albus cv. KievTwo field trials in which the effects of plant density and row spacing on L. albus cv. Kiev were studied, are described. One trial was carried out on dryland and the Other under irrigation. Plant densities ranging from c. 20 to c. 45 plants m-2 produced similar seed yields in both trials. On the other hand, row spacing had an appreciable effect on seed yield, with the narrowest spacing, 25 cm, out-yielding 50-cm and wider spacings significantly. The higher yield of the narrow row spacing was achieved through more pods and seeds per unit area, but kernel weight and pod size (seeds per pod) made no contribution in this regard. There was no correlation between seed yield and harvest index; therefore the higher yield with narrow row spacing reflected an improvement in general growth due to the more equidistant spatial arrangement.
