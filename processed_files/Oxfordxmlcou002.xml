These results suggest that leatherbacks are fasting during the nesting season.Serum protein concentrations provide insight into the nutritional and immune status of organisms. It has been suggested that some marine turtles are capital breeders that fast during the nesting season. In this study, we documented serum proteins in neophyte and remigrant nesting leatherback sea turtles (<italic>Dermochelys coriacea</italic>). This allowed us to establish trends across the nesting season to determine whether these physiological parameters indicate if leatherbacks forage or fast while on nesting grounds. Using the biuret method and agarose gel electrophoresis, total serum protein (median = 5.0 g/dl) and protein fractions were quantified and include pre-albumin (median = 0.0 g/dl), albumin (median = 1.81 g/dl), α<sub>1</sub>-globulin (median = 0.90 g/dl), α<sub>2</sub>-globulin (median = 0.74 g/dl), total α-globulin (median = 1.64 g/dl), β-globulin (median = 0.56 g/dl), γ-globulin (median = 0.81 g/dl) and total globulin (median = 3.12 g/dl). The albumin:globulin ratio (median = 0.59) was also calculated. Confidence intervals (90%) were used to establish reference intervals. Total protein, albumin and total globulin concentrations declined in successive nesting events. Protein fractions declined at less significant rates or remained relatively constant during the nesting season. Here, we show that leatherbacks are most likely fasting during the nesting season. A minimal threshold of total serum protein concentrations of around 3.5–4.5 g/dl may physiologically signal the end of the season's nesting for individual leatherbacks. The results presented here lend further insight into the interaction between reproduction, fasting and energy reserves and will potentially improve the conservation and management of this imperiled species.Parental care in reptiles rarely extends further than nest site selection and the nutrients that are provisioned within the albumen and yolk of the egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C48">Miller, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C40">Hughes and Hughes, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C55">Patel, 2013</xref>). While parental care is minimal in this vertebrate class, these organisms still incur costs to body condition and possibly health in order to reproduce successfully (i.e., maternal investment; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C67">Trivers, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C35">Harshman and Zera, 2007</xref>). Reptiles, including marine turtles, undergo energy trade-offs between the two extremely costly life functions of maintaining normal physiological processes and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C45">Le Maho, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C58">Plot <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Given that reproduction is costly, organisms must use one of the following two mechanisms to compensate for the resources lost during this process: (i) income breeding, when an organism forages while reproducing; or (ii) capital breeding, when an organism maintains energy for reproductive processes through stored resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C66">Stephens <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C58">Plot <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).Marine turtles are thought to use a capital breeding strategy, whereby large amounts of prey are ingested on foraging grounds and stored as fat reserves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C31">Hamann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C27">Goldberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). In some cases, opportunistic feeding by marine turtles while on breeding and nesting grounds has been proposed, but is likely to be negligible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C63">Schoefield <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C6">Casey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Sea turtles are unique among reptiles in that they embark on extremely long-distance migrations (&gt;13 000 km in the Atlantic; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C20">Eckert <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>, for review) from foraging grounds to nesting and breeding grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C59">Plotkin, 2003</xref>); these journeys are powered by fat stores that accumulate on foraging grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C68">Wallace <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). In particular, leatherback turtles make the most extensive migrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C20">Eckert <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>, for review), which are fuelled by gelatinous prey items that have relatively dilute energetic value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C3">Bjorndal, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C39">Houghton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C16">Doyle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). On foraging grounds, western Atlantic leatherbacks are known to ingest over 300 kg of food/day (up to 840 kg/day; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C37">Heaslip <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Although the energy density of their prey items is low, the massive amount of food ingested on foraging grounds is sufficient to fuel migrations southward and provide enough energy to sustain the largest reproductive output of all marine turtles (37–62 kg of eggs per season laid across six to 10 clutches; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C48">Miller, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C68">Wallace <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C29">Guirlet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C58">Plot <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).A substantial decrease in food intake during the nesting season is expected to influence biochemical parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C58">Plot <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), including serum proteins and their fractions. Serum proteins provide insight into the nutritional status of an organism, allowing for evaluation of the hydration and immune status, as well as identification of the presence of inflammation or infectious disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C4">Campbell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C21">Evans, 2011</xref>). Several studies report protein fractions in nesting marine turtles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C12">Deem <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C13">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C56">Perrault <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), and one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C38">Honarvar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) describes changes in proteins [total protein (TP), albumin and globulin] across the nesting season. The measures of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C38">Honarvar <italic>et al.</italic> (2011)</xref> are based upon a hand-held refractometer and a field chemistry analyser. These methods are considered less accurate than the laboratory-based electrophoretic measures used in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C10">Cray and Tatum, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C50">Müller and Brunnberg, 2010</xref>).In very few studies of marine turtles, changes in biochemical parameters across the nesting season have been measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C30">Hamann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C38">Honarvar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C56">Perrault <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C27">Goldberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C58">Plot <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Here we established the largest sample size of serum proteins and their fractions in leatherback sea turtles to date, describe seasonal changes of these physiological parameters in leatherbacks nesting on Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge (SPNWR), St Croix, US Virgin Islands, and verify that leatherbacks are capital breeders that fast during the nesting season.Sampling on SPNWR was conducted in conjunction with the West Indies Marine Animal Research and Conservation Service (WIMARCS) saturation-tagging project and was carried out in accordance with a National Marine Fisheries Service Special Use Permit # 41526-2009-004. Florida Atlantic University's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved this study (protocol #A07-03).Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge, St Croix, US Virgin Islands, nesting beach.The beach was patrolled on foot nightly for nesting activity from 20.00 to 05.00 h, or until the last female finished nesting. Turtles were identified by passive integrative transponder (PIT) tags and/or flipper tags. These tags were applied to nesting females that lacked either of these tag types. Tagging and blood collection from the hindlimb rete system of nesting leatherback turtles occurred during their nesting fixed action pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C18">Dutton and Dutton, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C17">Dutton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C56">Perrault <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). During oviposition, the sampling site was swabbed with betadine, and ∼7 ml of blood was collected aseptically into 10 ml serum separator (red-top) Vacutainer<sup>®</sup> tubes using 18 gauge venous collection needles fitted into Vacutainer<sup>®</sup> tube holders. After blood collection, the area was cleansed with betadine, and pressure was applied to promote haemostasis. Blood samples were chilled immediately on ice. Serum separator tubes were spun within 12 h of collection using a centrifuge at ∼1400 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. The serum was collected and separated into 2 ml Corning<sup>®</sup> cryogenic vials. When possible, subsequent samples were collected from the same nesting females during successive nesting events (8–12 days later). Serum was frozen at −20°C for 1 month before shipping on ice to the Veterinary Diagnostic and Investigational Laboratory at the University of Georgia (UGA-VDIL, Tifton, GA, USA) for analyses.Haemolysed samples or those exhibiting signs of lipaemia were removed from analyses. Total serum protein (TP) was determined by the biuret method (Siemens ADVIA 1200 Clinical Chemistry System, Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY, USA). Albumin, α-, β- and γ-globulins were determined by agarose gel electrophoresis using a Helena SPIFE 3000 system (Split Beta SPE, Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX, USA). Gels were stained with an acid blue stain and then scanned on a QuickScan 2000 densitometer (Helena Laboratories). Protein fractions were visually identified on the electrophoretogram and calculated by densitometry (percentage area under the curve multiplied by total serum protein concentration). Running conditions were 650 V for 6 min. Dual analyses were run for each sample and then averaged. The albumin:globulin (A:G) ratio was calculated. Quality control was carried out using serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) normal and SPE abnormal (Helena Laboratories) controls on each gel run.A general linear model was used to compare TP concentrations in remigrant nesters and neophytes (new nesters). The date of the nesting event was treated as a random factor. Repeated-measures ANOVAs were carried out to determine whether TP concentrations, protein fractions and/or the A:G ratio significantly differed in subsequent nesting events. We were able to assign the nesting females' nest number accurately based on the date observed at first nesting and knowing the nesting fidelity of turtles to SPNWR. For example, if a female's first observed nesting event was 1 April and she was then observed nesting again on 20 April, we predicted that 20 April was her third nesting event (internesting interval is 10 days on average). This allowed us to remove time as a covariate from the analyses. Additionally, TP and protein fraction concentrations from each predicted nest number (one to eight) were averaged, and regression analyses were appropriately fitted to the trends (linear, logarithmic or polynomial regressions). Sample sizes for nest numbers nine and 10 were low and were not used in statistical analyses, but are provided in the figures for comparison. In a few cases, nest numbers could not be estimated and, consequently, we did not include these samples in the analyses. Lastly, linear regression lines of TP, albumin and globulin were compared using Student's <italic>t</italic> test for slope of a regression line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C73">Zar, 1999</xref>).

Total protein concentrations in leatherbacks from St Croix were higher than those of nesting leatherbacks from Gabon, Pacific Costa Rica, Papua New Guinea and Florida (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C12">Deem <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C34">Harris <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C56">Perrault <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Additionally, TP concentrations in leatherbacks sampled during the 2009 nesting season were nominally higher than those in leatherbacks sampled from the same beach during the 2006 nesting season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C34">Harris <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>); however, this could be due to methodological differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C10">Cray and Tatum, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C50">Müller and Brunnberg, 2010</xref>). None of the sampled individuals from our study was sampled during the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C34">Harris <italic>et al.</italic> (2011)</xref> of nesting leatherbacks from St Croix (H. Harris, personal communication), so temporal comparisons within individuals across years were not possible.Nesting turtles are expected to have lower concentrations of TP than foraging turtles because of protein loss during the nesting season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C34">Harris <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C13">Deem <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)</xref> found higher TP concentrations in nesting loggerheads (<italic>Caretta caretta</italic>) compared with foraging loggerheads. This was attributed to their reproductive state (i.e., follicle and egg formation trigger protein mobilization). Environmental, spatial, dietary and temporal factors can influence TP concentrations and may explain differences among years, populations and individuals in different physiological states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C52">Osborne <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).Marine turtles rely on the mobilization of fat stores during the nesting season; this is supported by a large decline in plasma triglycerides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C55">Patel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C58">Plot <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Total protein concentrations declined significantly in nesting leatherbacks from St Croix over the nesting season (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU002F3">3</xref>a), indicating that they are relying on bodily lipids for nutrients. When lipid stores become severely depleted, a shift occurs from fat metabolism to skeletal muscle (i.e., protein) catabolism, which produces the major source of carbon for maintenance of blood glucose levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C9">Cherel <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C30">Hamann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C58">Plot <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). This shift is evidenced by an increase in blood urea nitrogen, a measure that has value as an indicator of nutritional status. Although we did not measure this metabolite, nesting females from French Guiana exhibited a large dip in blood urea nitrogen at the beginning of the nesting season followed by an increase at the end of the nesting season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C58">Plot <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). This trend was also observed in Floridian nesting leatherbacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C56">Perrault <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), indicating that these animals have entered the protein-catabolizing phase of fasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C9">Cherel <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C58">Plot <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) and that foraging does not occur while leatherbacks are nesting. However, the increase in blood urea nitrogen could also indicate that these animals have resumed feeding at the end of the nesting season.Total protein concentrations declined significantly across the nesting season, with the largest decline occurring from the ninth to 10th clutch (mean ± SD = −0.17 ± 0.06 g/dl decline between each nesting event; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU002F3">3</xref>a). Total protein concentrations during the first clutch averaged 5.7 ± 0.6 g/dl, while concentrations of the eighth, ninth and 10th clutches averaged 4.5 ± 0.5, 4.4 ± 0.4 and 4.1 ± 0.5 g/dl, respectively. Total protein concentrations in nesting leatherbacks from Equatorial Guinea and St Croix were similar during the first (∼5.5 and 5.7 ± 0.2 g/dl, respectively) and fifth nesting events (∼4.5 and 4.9 ± 0.1 g/dl, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C38">Honarvar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). This suggests that the decline in TP is similar in nesting leatherbacks across populations. It is unknown if leatherbacks forage during their migrations to nesting grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C43">James <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Green turtles (<italic>Chelonia mydas</italic>; primarily herbivores) are thought to refrain from foraging during this journey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C36">Hatase <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Therefore, TP concentrations could potentially decline during extensive migratory movements (≥4 months; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C26">Girondot and Fretey, 1996</xref>). However, fasting during feeding-to-breeding ground migration is unlikely in leatherbacks, because foraging individuals from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans had TP concentrations that were similar (despite methodological differences) to concentrations observed during the early portion of the nesting season at SPNWR (first to fourth nests; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C41">Innis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C34">Harris <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The results presented here suggest that serum TP concentrations may be used to evaluate whether female turtles are early (first to fourth clutches) or late (fifth clutch or later) in their reproductive cycles during the nesting season.In birds and mammals, pre-albumin is composed of the protein transthyretin, which binds the thyroid hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C8">Chang <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). A pre-albumin band was observed in only eight individuals in this study (6% of total samples). In general, pre-albumin is rarely observed or is found at minimal concentrations in marine turtles and other herpetofauna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C33">Harms <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C71">Work <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C25">Gicking <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C12">Deem <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C13">2009</xref>). Interestingly, in humans transthyretin is used to indicate malnutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C2">Bernstein and Ingenbleek, 2002</xref>), and it is plausible that nesting marine turtles have decreased concentrations of this protein due to fasting. This is unlikely, because foraging sea turtles also have a low incidence of this fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C25">Gicking <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C13">Deem <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Pre-albumin has the same mobility as albumin, which may explain why it is masked in agarose gel electrophoresis assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C47">Lumeij, 2008</xref>).Despite methodological differences, albumin concentrations are similar across all leatherback studies (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COU002TB2">2</xref>), suggesting that albumin concentrations in leatherback turtles are relatively similar within the species and across populations. Albumin concentrations in leatherbacks were higher than the concentrations observed in loggerheads and green turtles of all life stages (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COU002TB2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C25">Gicking <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C13">Deem <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C52">Osborne <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Albumin concentrations in foraging leatherbacks tend to be slightly higher than those of nesting female leatherbacks (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COU002TB2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C12">Deem <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C41">Innis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C34">Harris <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C38">Honarvar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C56">Perrault <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; present study), which is likely due to fasting during the nesting season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C38">Honarvar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), discussed below (in Seasonal trends of pre-albumin and albumin).The albumin fraction is considered to be a negative acute-phase protein, whereby decreases in concentration (relative to normal concentrations) can be related to injury or inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C52">Osborne <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Reduced albumin concentrations have been documented in nesting marine turtle studies [hawksbill (<italic>Eretmochelys imbricata</italic>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C27">Goldberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; leatherback, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C38">Honarvar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; Perrault <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012], most likely resulting from fasting during the nesting season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C72">Zaias and Cray, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C21">Evans, 2011</xref>). Additional albumin loss may occur through the production of albumen during amniotic egg formation, because serum albumin is a large component of the egg white (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C70">Woodward, 1990</xref>). Albumin concentrations in nesting leatherbacks from Equatorial Guinea and St Croix were similar during the first (∼2.0 and 2.1 ± 0.4 g/dl, respectively) and fifth nesting events (∼1.6 and 1.8 ± 0.2 g/dl, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C38">Honarvar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The increase in serum albumin concentrations at the end of the nesting season is puzzling. In nesting hawksbills from Brazil, an appetite-stimulating hormone (ghrelin) was found to increase at the end of the nesting season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C27">Goldberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). If a similar trend occurs in leatherbacks, perhaps nesting females begin to forage opportunistically towards the end of the nesting season, which may explain the increase in serum albumin concentration in the ninth and 10th samples (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU002F3">3</xref>b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C23">Fossette <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).Few studies document protein fractions (α-, β- and γ-globulins) in marine turtles (green turtles, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C42">Jacobson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C52">Osborne <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; loggerheads, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C25">Gicking <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C42">Jacobson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C52">Osborne <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; leatherbacks, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C12">Deem <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C41">Innis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C56">Perrault <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; present study). Concentrations of α<sub>1</sub>-globulins were highest in leatherbacks from St Croix, while concentrations of α<sub>2</sub>-globulins were highest in leatherbacks from Gabon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C12">Deem <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C41">Innis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Concentrations of α<sub>1</sub>- and α<sub>2</sub>-globulins were higher in St Croix leatherbacks in comparison to leatherbacks foraging in the western Atlantic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C41">Innis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). This finding was intriguing and may reflect inflammation due to injury, because a large number of nesting leatherbacks from St Croix had numerous injuries (from boat strikes, fisheries-related damage, mating injuries or predator attack). Injuries were more prevalent in the Cruzan population in comparison to the Floridian population (J. Perrault, personal observation). Elevated concentrations of α-globulins in nesting females may also be due to physical stress or metabolic status associated with nesting, which may increase bodily concentrations of acute-phase proteins (e.g. α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin and α<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C21">Evans, 2011</xref>). This trend is similar to that reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C13">Deem <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)</xref>, where relatively higher concentrations of α-globulins were found in nesting female loggerheads compared with foraging loggerheads.Concentrations of the β-globulin fraction were similar across all leatherback studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C12">Deem <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C41">Innis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C56">Perrault <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; present study); however, β-globulin concentrations in nesting loggerheads from Georgia, USA were higher, by one order of magnitude (on average), than in other marine turtles (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COU002TB2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C13">Deem <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). β-Globulins consist mainly of acute-phase proteins (e.g. β-lipoprotein; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C10">Cray and Tatum, 1998</xref>), but some immunoglobulins may be present in this fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C52">Osborne <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C21">Evans, 2011</xref>). In nesting psittacine birds (i.e., parrots), increases in β-globulins have been observed, which may result from an increase in transferrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C65">Song <italic>et al.</italic>, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C10">Cray and Tatum, 1998</xref>), an enzyme that transports iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C22">Fletcher and Huehns, 1968</xref>). Leatherbacks may have a similar mechanism of transferrin-based iron mobilization during nesting; however, transferrin was found to lie in the γ-globulin region in loggerhead turtles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C51">Musquera <italic>et al.</italic>, 1976</xref>).The α<sub>1</sub>-globulin fraction exhibited a sinusoidal trend during the nesting season (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU002F3">3</xref>c), while the α<sub>2</sub>-globulin fraction tended to decrease during the nesting season (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU002F3">3</xref>d). Total α-globulin also tended to decrease, but in a stepwise manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU002F3">3</xref>e). Lastly, the β-globulin fraction decreased across the nesting season; however a slight sinusoidal pattern was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU002F3">3</xref>f). The α- and β-fractions are positive acute-phase proteins that increase in response to infection and/or inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C69">Walton, 2001</xref>), although some immunoglobulins may extend into the β-fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C21">Evans, 2011</xref>). Concentrations of the acute-phase proteins are expected to decrease in response to fasting and deposition into eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C70">Woodward, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C44">Kaneko, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C54">Paltrinieri, 2008</xref>), explaining the overall decrease in the α- and β-fractions during the nesting season. Decreases in the α- and β-fractions may also have occurred due to wound healing and the presence of fewer injuries during the end of the nesting season. The acute-phase response (i.e., response to injury or inflammation) exhibits a greater influence on acute-phase protein concentrations than foraging, which may be the reason for the fluctuations of α<sub>1</sub>- and β-globulin fractions during the nesting season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C7">Cerón <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).The presence of β-γ bridging (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU002F2">2</xref>c) was found in only six samples (five turtles; 4% of the study samples) in this study. This electrophoretic pattern has also been observed in western Atlantic loggerheads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C25">Gicking <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), but was not observed in nesting leatherbacks from Gabon, Africa or Florida, USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C12">Deem <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C56">Perrault <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). The presence of β-γ bridging can indicate chronic disease (including hepatitis) or parasitic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C44">Kaneko, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C10">Cray and Tatum, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C25">Gicking <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). We cannot make inferences about our results in the absence of other plasma biochemical values to assess hepatic disease (e.g. alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase). Reptiles store fat in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C14">Derickson, 1976</xref>), and hepatic stress or liver disease may have occurred as a result of activation of hepatic lipid reserves during vitellogenesis. Perhaps the turtles with β-γ bridging had prior or coincident hepatic disease that was aggravated by egg formation.In general, concentrations of γ-globulins are higher in foraging marine turtles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C13">Deem <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C41">Innis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>) compared with nesting turtles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C12">Deem <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C13">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C56">Perrault <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; present study). High concentrations of immunoglobulins were observed in wild-caught loggerhead turtles and were attributed to possible trematode infection that stimulated antibody production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C25">Gicking <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Immunoglobulin concentrations were lower in juvenile loggerheads compared with adults of the same species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C25">Gicking <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), which may be attributed to the more mature immune system (due to longer periods of antigenic stimulation) of adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C41">Innis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Decreased concentrations of γ-globulins can result from immunosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C44">Kaneko, 1997</xref>) or differences in antigenic stimulation between foraging and nesting populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C52">Osborne <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).The γ-globulins tended to decrease in a stepwise manner during the nesting season (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU002F3">3</xref>g). Long-distance migration may be a large immunostimulant in leatherbacks. These migratory turtles may well encounter a number of antigens during these extensive journeys, which would increase concentrations of γ-globulins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C64">Sibley and Johnsgard, 1959</xref>) by the beginning of the nesting season. Normalization of the immunoglobulins may occur during the nesting season while turtle movements are more regional. Leatherbacks experience a decrease in body condition index throughout the nesting season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C58">Plot <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), further explaining the decrease of immune proteins. Lastly, a number of γ-globulins are deposited into egg albumen, which may also contribute to the stepwise decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C70">Woodward, 1990</xref>).During the 2009 nesting season, one of the world's largest oil refineries, HOVENSA, was in operation, producing nearly 500 000 barrels of oil/d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C60">Rae, 2009</xref>). Release of toxicants (e.g. heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) into local waters where leatherbacks reside during internesting intervals may lead to immune system suppression in these animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C5">Carlson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C11">Day <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C49">Mishra, 2009</xref>), with an associated decrease in γ-globulins. Interestingly, blood total mercury concentrations in Cruzan nesting females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C57">Perrault <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) were negatively correlated with γ-globulins (Spearman rank order correlation; <italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = −0.24, <italic>P</italic> = 0.01; J. R. Perrault, unpublished data), suggesting that toxicants may be related to a suppression of the immune system in marine turtles.Lastly, the A:G ratio is a valuable tool in determining the relative health status of an organism, where lower A:G ratios are indicative of decreased health status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C47">Lumeij, 2008</xref>). However, increased A:G ratios do not necessarily reflect better health. The release of glucocorticoids, a class of stress hormones, can suppress globulin production during reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C61">Rafferty and Scheelings, 2014</xref>). To support this theory, A:G ratio estimates in nesting leatherbacks were higher than those in foraging leatherbacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C34">Harris <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Additionally, species-specific differences in the A:G ratio are plausible among marine turtles, as is seen in comparisons of bird species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C46">Lumeij, 1987</xref>). Nesting and foraging green turtles and leatherbacks had higher A:G ratios than loggerheads (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COU002TB2">2</xref>), possibly as a result of dietary differences. Temporal fluctuations may also be at play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C42">Jacobson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Differences in the A:G ratio are attributable to differences in globulin concentrations. Albumin concentrations were similar across all populations (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COU002TB2">2</xref>), and shifts in globulin may result from antigenic stimulation caused by migrating and nesting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C52">Osborne <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).The A:G ratio was stable throughout the nesting season (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU002F3">3</xref>i), as a result of a concomitant decrease in albumin and globulin throughout the nesting season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C21">Evans, 2011</xref>). We found a slight increase in the A:G ratio towards the end of the nesting season (ninth and 10th samples), which was attributed to an increase in albumins. This slight increase may reflect the resumption of feeding towards the end of the nesting season or follicular atresia (yolk contains a variety of serum proteins; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C53">Palmer and Guillette, 1991</xref>). We found that albumin tended to decline at a slower rate than globulin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COU002F4">4</xref>); however, the difference was not enough to affect the A:G ratio, which changed minimally during the nesting season (range, 0.58–0.63 on average). Estrogen induces hyperglobulinaemia during follicle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C15">Dessauer, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C4">Campbell, 2006</xref>), and we assume that more globulin proteins were mobilized during vitellogenesis, increasing their concentrations at the beginning of the nesting season. This explains the more rapid decrease in globulins relative to albumin at the end of the nesting season.Here we provide the following principal findings: (i) the largest sample size of serum proteins and their fractions in nesting leatherbacks; (ii) evidence that some leatherbacks may be immunocompromised during the nesting season; (iii) evidence that leatherback turtles are fasting during the nesting season; and (iv) evidence that reduction in TP may herald the end of a female's nesting allocation for the season. A threshold concentration of TP (∼3.5–4.5 g/dl) may serve as a physiological signal to indicate that the nesting period is complete for individual leatherbacks and that foraging should resume. A critical level of energy depletion is thought to induce the resumption of feeding in marine vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C28">Groscolas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). None of the 76 sampled leatherbacks in this study showed evidence of chronic malnutrition (TP = &lt;3 g/dl; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C4">Campbell, 2006</xref>), supporting the conclusion that a TP threshold exists. Slight increases in albumin and γ-globulin were observed at the end of the nesting season, suggesting that nesting females are exhibiting follicular atresia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C62">Rostal <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>) and/or beginning to feed before their long-distance migrations back to productive foraging grounds. Significant decreases in some of the protein fractions were not observed, owing to low sample sizes; however, the decreasing trends in the linear regressions (TP, albumin and total globulin) are obvious. The data presented here do not support the hypothesis that nesting leatherbacks from St Croix forage during the nesting season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C19">Eckert <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>) and, instead, confirm the capital breeding hypothesis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COU002C58">Plot <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref>. Lastly, this study provides insight into the behaviour of leatherback turtles during their internesting intervals, which has proved challenging to population managers and conservationists. We now have a greater understanding of the interactions between leatherback turtle reproduction, fasting and energy reserves during the nesting season, which could improve conservation practices for this internationally endangered species.<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conphys.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/conphys/cou002/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary material is available at <italic>Conservation Physiology</italic> online</ext-link>.We thank the staff and volunteers of the University of Georgia, the University of Georgia's Veterinary Diagnostic and Investigational Laboratory and the West Indies Marine Animal Research and Conservation Service, particularly S.
