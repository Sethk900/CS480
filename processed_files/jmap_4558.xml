Stability analysis of kernel and milling characteristics in winter and facultative wheatConsistency in quality of wheat grain and flour over seasons is critical to the manufacture of high quality products. The aim of this study was to measure the stability of kernel and milling quality characteristics. Thirteen hard red winter and facultative pure line and hybrid bread wheat varieties were evaluated at two planting dates for three seasons. IPC1 stability scores were compared with the AMMI stability values. Environment was found to be the most important contributor to variance in all traits. Genotype was a large contributor of variance for thousand kernel weight, kernel diameter and hardness index. GXE interaction contributed more to variation than genotype for test weight, percentage vitreous kernels, flour yield, flour colour and flour protein content at both planting dates. Molen was the most stable cultivar overall for the first planting date. At the second planting date PAN3235 and Limpopo were the most stable. The quality of the hybrids was the most inconsistent.
