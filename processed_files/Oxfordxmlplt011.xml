Endophytes are generally known to be present in few numbers colonizing the intercellular spaces, primarily in roots. This study adopting SYTO 9 staining and live confocal imaging of fresh tissue sections from the shoot-tip region of banana, supported by transmission electron microscopy, brings out, possibly for the first time, extensive bacterial colonization in the confined cell wall – plasma membrane peri-space. The integral host-association and their abundance suggest a prominent role of endophytes in the biology of the host.This study was aimed at generating microscopic evidence of intra-tissue colonization in banana in support of the previous findings on widespread association of endophytic bacteria with the shoot tips of field-grown plants and micropropagated cultures, and to understand the extent of tissue colonization. Leaf-sheath tissue sections (∼50–100 µm) from aseptically gathered shoot tips of cv. Grand Naine were treated with Live/Dead bacterial viability kit components SYTO 9 (S9) and propidium iodide (PI) followed by epifluorescence or confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The S9, which targets live bacteria, showed abundant green-fluorescing particles along the host cell periphery in CLSM, apparently in between the plasma membrane and the cell wall. These included non-motile and occasional actively motile single bacterial cells seen in different <italic>x</italic>–<italic>y</italic> planes and <italic>z</italic>-stacks over several cell layers, with the fluorescence signal similar to that of pure cultures of banana endophytes. Propidium iodide, which stains dead bacteria, did not detect any, but post-ethanol treatment, both PI and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole detected abundant bacteria. Propidium iodide showed clear nuclear staining, as did S9 to some extent, and the fluorophores appeared to detect bacteria at the exclusion of DNA-containing plant organelles as gathered from bright-field and phase-contrast microscopy. The S9–PI staining did not work satisfactorily with formalin- or paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue. The extensive bacterial colonization in fresh tissue was further confirmed with the suckers of different cultivars, and was supported by transmission electron microscopy. This study thus provides clear microscopic evidence of the extensive endophytic bacterial inhabitation in the confined cell wall–plasma membrane peri-space in shoot tissue of banana with the organisms sharing an integral association with the host. The abundant tissue colonization suggests a possible involvement of endophytes in the biology of the host besides recognizing cell wall–plasma membrane peri-space as a major niche for plant-associated bacteria.The plant microbiome includes pathogenic, symbiotic, epiphytic and endophytic associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C24">Parniske 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C30">Rosenblueth and Martínez-Romero 2006</xref>).

While live bacteria with intact cell membranes are stained fluorescent green by S9, those with damaged membranes are stained red by PI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C1">Anonymous 2004</xref>). To our knowledge, this approach has not been explored much in studies of plant–microbe association except for some isolated reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C7">Böhm <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C22">Lucero <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>).

Grand Naine formed the main experimental sample. The shoot tips comprising the apical 2–3 cm of pseudostem sheaths and the anchoring 1 cm corm tissue were excised aseptically after extensive surface sterilization as per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C42">Thomas <italic>et al.</italic> (2008<italic>a</italic>)</xref>. The tissue was fixed in 4 % formalin–phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or 2 % paraformaldehyde–PBS overnight at 4 °C. Thin tissue sections prepared from the innermost sheaths of fixed tissue as well as fresh tissue from 10 suckers each were employed in bright-field, epifluorescence and confocal microscopy. Five suckers each from the cvs. Robusta, Dwarf Cavendish and Ney Poovan were used for validation. In addition, micropropagated stock cultures of cv. Grand Naine were also employed. These included five from the stocks showing non-obvious or covert bacterial association as brought out through tissue indexing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C42">Thomas <italic>et al.</italic> 2008<italic>a</italic></xref>), and five from stocks not showing culturable bacteria but non-culturable organisms as per the microscopic observation of the tissue squeeze under phase contrast as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C42">Thomas <italic>et al.</italic> 2008<italic>a</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C39">Thomas and Soly 2009</xref>).A Leica DM2000 optical microscope along with a DFC-295 digital live camera and Leica Application Suite (LAS) software version 2.0 (Leica Microsystems CMS GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) was employed for bright-field and phase-contrast microscopy. Thin, free-hand-cut tissue sections (∼50–100 µm) prepared employing a fine razor blade, as well as the tissue homogenate, were examined after mounting on acetone-washed and autoclaved microscope slides under oil immersion (×1000).

Thin sections (∼50–100 µm) were prepared aseptically from fixed as well as fresh tissue. These were covered with the fluorophores singly or in combination as per the manufacturer's instructions (6 μM S9 and 30 μM PI at 1×) and examined under the epifluorescence microscope after 10–20 min. A Leica DMLB2 microscope with GFP and I3 filter cubes for blue excitation, and N3 for green excitation, and with a DFC320 digital live camera (Leica Microsystems CMS GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) under ×63 oil or ×100 water immersion objectives was employed. The images were captured with LAS software version 2.0 and further processed with Adobe Photoshop 7.0. The preparation of S9 stain or the mounting of tissue in phosphate buffer (0.5 M; pH 7.4), PBS or saline versus plain distilled water was also assessed for the signal levels.Thin sections prepared from fresh tissue as above were examined 10–20 min after the application of DAPI, S9 or PI fluorophores singly, or in combinations of two fluorophores, using an LSM 5 LIVE confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) equipped with a 488 nm laser and supported by LSM software (Carl Zeiss Inc., Jena GmbH, Germany). SYTO 9- and PI-stained samples were excited at 488 nm, and the DAPI-stained samples at 405 nm.

The intercellular spaces, which are often described as a habitat for bacterial endophytes, are technically covered by the term apoplast, meaning outside protoplast, as opposed to symplast, the network of cell cytoplasm interconnected by plasmodesmata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C20">Leopold and Kriedman 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C32">Sattelmacher 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C37">Taiz and Zeiger 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C14">Evert 2006</xref>).

It is probable that the bacteria migrated from the loose intercellular spaces in the roots to the narrow intra-cell wall region in the shoots through the gaps or through the vascular interconnections. Studies on apoplast-colonizing endophytes have often adopted the collection of apoplastic fluid through techniques like centrifugation or vacuum extraction and its plating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C5">Barraquio <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C32">Sattelmacher 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C2">Asis <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>). It is less likely that the type of intra-cell wall colonizers documented in this study could be harvested with vacuum extraction or centrifugation, as the cells get blocked by the cell wall.

Unlike in the above-cited studies, we focused on the shoot-tip tissue where the host parenchymatous cells were very closely packed with no obvious intercellular spaces or air pockets. We describe this niche as ‘peri-cytoplasmic space’ or ‘peri-space’, which corresponds to periplasm, i.e. the space between the cytoplasmic and outer membranes in bacteria, particularly in the Gram-negative group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C33">Seltmann and Holst 2002</xref>).The observations in this study were facilitated by the use of S9 on fresh tissue sections under high magnification (×63 or ×100 objective) and live imaging where the bacterial cells could be detected easily based on their staining and/or motility. The organisms in the narrow peri-space appeared in singles rather than in groups, unlike what is documented in the studies employing TEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C28">Reinhold-Hurek and Hurek 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C16">Gyaneshwar <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>) or FISH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C10">Compant <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>) where paraffin- or resin-embedded tissue post-fixation had been used. Wherever tissue fixation is involved, there is the chance of air entrapment and free spaces if the fixation step is not conducted properly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C26">Prieto <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C22">Lucero <italic>et al.</italic> (2011)</xref> employed S9–PI staining to study the endophytic microbiome in <italic>Atriplex</italic> sp., but adopted tissue fixation in glutaraldehyde post-staining and a low magnification (×20 objective), a resolution that was probably insufficient to detect individual bacterial cells. With the free-hand-cut sections, there was a possibility of bacterial cells becoming dislodged, but the confocal <italic>z</italic>-scanning over undisturbed cell layers confirmed their above-defined location inside tissue. Live imaging of plant cells has provided considerable new information about cell structure and functioning in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C35">Shaw 2006</xref>). A direct viewing of the confocal screen is highly recommended to visualize the bacterial positioning or movement in the confined peri-space as upon conversion to avi files the confocal time-lapse files gave brief-span fast video files, which was a limitation faced in presenting the real-time situation.Propidium iodide and DAPI treatments did not normally detect the endophytic bacteria on fresh tissue sections, but did so in ethanol-challenged sets, indicating that the loss of membrane integrity was a necessity for the entry of these stains into bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C1">Anonymous 2004</xref>), and that healthy plant tissue contained only live bacteria. The observations from TEM supported the bacterial line-up just inside the cell wall. It is to be noted that S9–PI staining did not work effectively with the formalin- or paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue owing to high tissue auto-fluorescence or the lack of any signal. Further, the staining efficiency in phosphate buffer or PBS was low, possibly influenced by the buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C1">Anonymous 2004</xref>). In addition, all the host cells in a field did not uniformly display stained bacterial cells with S9. Whether this resulted from inadequate penetration of the dye in fresh tissue or was a reflection of an uneven bacterial distribution is not clear at present. With S9 staining of pure bacterial cultures, the signal level varied with the organism, suggesting that this was possibly linked to the stage of growth or the DNA content. Altogether, the results suggested that S9 staining could be taken as a gross bacterial detection tool but not for assessing the extent of variability.It is pertinent to note that all the suckers examined across different genotypes of banana, as well as the apparently clean micropropagated banana cultures <italic>in vitro</italic>, also showed bacterial presence in the cell peri-space. The wide prevalence and the sheer numbers in which the organisms are present indicate that this association could have evolved with the crop a long time ago rather than the immediate lateral recruitment. Endophytes are generally considered to be selected or recruited from the rhizosphere by the host plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C30">Rosenblueth and Martínez-Romero 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C8">Compant <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C21">Long <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C45">Bulgarelli <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C46">Lundberg <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). While this may be the case for seed-propagated plants, there may be an endophytic continuum in tissue for the clonally propagated plants with the established organisms becoming an integral component through generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C39">Thomas and Soly 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C10">Compant <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>).The fact that banana tissue homogenate showed abundant bacteria under direct microscopy but hardly any colony growth upon plating undertaken as part of this study (data not shown) and in the studies documented earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C42">Thomas <italic>et al.</italic> 2008<italic>a</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C39">Thomas and Soly 2009</xref>) is an endorsement of the general non-culturability of the associated organisms or that their growth requirements are yet to be understood. A large proportion of endophytes associated with different plant species are considered to be not amenable for cultivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C41">Thomas <italic>et al.</italic> 2007<italic>b</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C44">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C38">Thomas 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C34">Sessitsch <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). The classes or groups of organisms involved or their functions are not known at present. It is not a simple task to understand the functionality of the endophytic bacteria here considering the diversity of the organisms so far isolated from this crop in the earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C43">Thomas <italic>et al.</italic> 2008<italic>b</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C39">Thomas and Soly 2009</xref>), the non-culturability of the large share of the organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C42">Thomas <italic>et al.</italic> 2008<italic>a</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C39">Thomas and Soly 2009</xref>) and the non-feasibility of excluding the entire native microflora for studying specific organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C38">Thomas 2011</xref>). While approaches like FISH will give a glimpse of bacterial diversity, it would warrant exhaustive approaches like metagenome analysis to elucidate the diversity and decipher the functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C44">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C34">Sessitsch <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). Furthermore, the use of endophytes isolated from banana after tagging with fluorescent markers such as GFP would help in studying the mode of entry and the pattern of tissue colonization, and in elucidating the functions; this is envisaged as a future study.Although endophytic bacteria are generally considered to be extracellular colonizers except for some intra-cellular presence in the root cortex at the time of entry, intra-cellular colonization of non-root tissue has been reported in some instances. This included the colonization of shoot meristem in Scotch pine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C25">Pirttilä <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>) and of <italic>in vitro</italic> grown peach palms, the latter termed ‘bacteriosomes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C11">de Almeida <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Our observations employing cell suspension cultures have also indicated some intra-cellular bacterial presence, but this elucidation required a different microscopic approach than the staining of extra-cytoplasmic bacteria (P. Thomas <italic>et al</italic>., unpubl. res.). Although the cell wall forms an integral component in plant cells, in principle, only the cytoplasmic region constitutes the active cell machinery. Therefore, we consider the present observation of bacterial colonization as distinct from the extensively documented intercellular apoplastic colonization or the intra-cellular cytoplasmic colonization.Detection of abundant bacteria in banana shoots assumes more importance as the shoot tissue contributes to the perpetuation of the host, including in micropropagation systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C42">Thomas <italic>et al.</italic> 2008<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C43"><italic>b</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C36">Singh <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). The observations here highlight the need to take into account the vast amount of resident microflora while studying the colonization by laterally introduced organisms, which are often overlooked, such as in growth promotion and fluorescent tagging studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C16">Gyaneshwar <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C40">Thomas <italic>et al.</italic> 2007<italic>a</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C9">Compant <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C27">Prieto <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Further, the abundant bacterial cells detected in the <italic>in vitro</italic> stocks of banana under a supposedly axenic tissue culture system further point to the fact that the gnotobiotic studies need to consider these non-obvious and non-culturable endophytes associated with the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C42">Thomas <italic>et al.</italic> 2008<italic>a</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C11">de Almeida <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C27">Prieto <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C38">Thomas 2011</xref>).This study makes a significant advance in the form of elucidating the abundant bacterial colonization in the cell wall–plasma membrane peri-space with the visualization of live and active bacterial cells by adopting the Live/Dead viability staining kit, unlike in other techniques such as FISH or TEM which detect non-live bacteria. The presence of the organisms in high numbers is an indication that they play an integral role in the biology of the host, with implications for studies relating to plant physiology, molecular biology and plant microbiology. It is also of concern that the DNA from such organisms would be co-purified with plant DNA, which could significantly alter the conclusions from molecular studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C41">Thomas <italic>et al.</italic> 2007<italic>b</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C42">2008<italic>a</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT011C39">Thomas and Soly 2009</xref>).This study demonstrates the applicability of the Live/Dead bacterial staining kit on non-fixed fresh tissue sections for the detection of endophytic bacteria and reveals the extensive bacterial colonization in the intra-cellular extra-cytoplasmic peri-space in banana shoot-tip tissue, which we consider as a niche not elucidated in previous studies. The microorganisms, present in innumerable numbers, possibly share a deep and integral association with the host, but show apparently mutualistic benefits with no obvious adverse or pathogenic effect on the host. The observations reported here open the path to further in-depth investigations on the plant–endophyte association and interactions.The study was undertaken under the AMAAS project ‘Basic and applied investigations on endophytic microorganisms in horticultural crops’ funded by <grant-sponsor xlink:type="simple">the Indian Council of Agricultural Research through the National Bureau of Agriculturally Important Microorganisms (NBAIM)</grant-sponsor>, Mau.P.T. contributed in the development of the concept, bright-field, phase-contrast, fluorescent and confocal microscopy, and the preparation and uploading of the article.
