Modeling rangeland soil erosion with high-resolution aerial photogrammetryTechniques for measuring and monitoring soil erosion in rangelands typically involve ground surveying or silt traps over small areas. These techniques are labor intensive and require many field visits which quickly become expensive in large monitoring programs. Airborne data collection could greatly increase the extent and efficiency of monitoring soil erosion. Using digital stereo aerial photography, we can create high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) of the soil surface at multiple points in time. The observed change between the DEMs allows for quantification and visualization of soil erosion, deposition, and redistribution over large areas. Soil elevation change from DEM differencing constitutes a new tool for natural resource managers and researchers to measure rangeland soil erosion over time and quantify erosion processes at multiple scales. With further development it can inform, validate or replace current erosion models used in broad-scale monitoring programs with efficiency superior to field methods. Another application for this research could include post-wildfire rehabilitation monitoring. Future research on measuring soil erosion from DEM differencing will shift to unmanned aerial systems (UAS) as they can provide imagery at reduced costs.
