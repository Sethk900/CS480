Two canthocamptid copepods of the genera Itunella and Mesochra (Harpacticoida, Canthocamptidae) from brackish waters in South KoreaTwo new harpacticoid species belonging to the family Canthocamptidae are described from brackish waters in South Korea: Itunella arenaria sp. nov. and Mesochra bisetosa sp. nov. The genus Itunella is first known from the Pacific. Itunella arenaria most resembles I. muelleri (Gagern) among three recognized congeners; however, it is characterized by the shape of the anal operculum with serrated projections beside it, and the armature of the endopods of legs 2â€“4 in the male. Mesochra bisetosa is closely related to two Asian allies, M. quadrispinosa from China and M. hinumaensis from Japan, but differs from them in the paucity of setae on the third endopodal segments of legs 2 and 3. Description and the taxonomic accounts of the two new species are presented with illustrations and scanning electron micrographs.
