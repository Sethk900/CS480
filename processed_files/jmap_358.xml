The Boar-Operated-System: a Novel Method to Deliver Baits to Wild Pigs.Bait-delivered pharmaceuticals, increasingly used to manage populations of wild boar (<em>Sus scrofa</em>) and feral pigs, may be ingested by nontarget species. Species-specificity could be achieved through a delivery system. We designed the BOS™ (Boar-Operated-System) as a device to deliver baits to wild pigs. The BOS™ consists of a metal pole onto which a round perforated base is attached. A metal cone with a wide rim slides up and down the pole and fully encloses the base onto which the baits are placed. We conducted a pilot, captive trial and found that captive wild boar fed from the BOS™ either directly, by lifting the cone, or indirectly, by feeding once another animal had lifted the cone. Thus, we tested whether free-living wild boar fed from the BOS™ and whether the BOS™ could prevent bait uptake by nontarget species. We observed that free-living wild boar fed regularly from the BOS™ and that the device successfully prevented bait uptake by nontarget species. The BOS™ should be trialed more extensively to confirm its effectiveness and species-specificity to distribute pharmaceuticals to wild suids. If successful, the BOS™ could be used to deliver vaccines in disease control programs as well as contraceptives to manage overabundant populations of wild suids.
