Andinopanurgus, a new Andean subgenus of Protandrena (Hymenoptera, Andrenidae)Abstract A new subgenus of Protandrena Cockerell (Panurginae: Protandrenini) from South America, Andinopanurgus Gonzalez & Engel, subgen. n., is described and figured for distinctive species of the genus occurring at mid- and high elevations in the Andes from Venezuela to Peru (1100â€“3400 m). In addition to the distribution, the subgenus is easily distinguished from other subgenera by a unique combination of morphological characters in both sexes, especially in the hidden sterna and genitalia of the male. Protandrena amyae sp. n., and Protandrena femoralis sp. n., are also described and figured from the Ecuadorian and Peruvian Andes. New geographical records and a key to the species are also provided.
