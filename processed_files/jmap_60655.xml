Cloud motion vectors from MISR using sub-pixel enhancementsThe operational retrieval of height-resolved cloud motion vectors by the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer on the Terra satellite has been significantly improved by using sub-pixel approaches to co-registration and disparity assessment, and by imposing stronger quality control based on the agreement between independent forward and aft triplet retrievals. Analysis of the fore-aft differences indicates that CMVs pass the basic operational quality control 67% of the time, with rms differences â in speed of 2.4Â m/s, in direction of 17Â°, and in height assignment of 290Â m. The use of enhanced quality control thresholds reduces these rms values to 1.5Â m/s, 14Â° and 165Â m, respectively, at the cost of reduced coverage to 45%. Use of the enhanced thresholds also eliminates a tendency for the rms differences to increase with height. Comparison of CMVs from an earlier operational version that had slightly weaker quality control, with 6-hour forecast winds from the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office yielded very low bias values and an rms vector difference that ranged from 5Â m/s for low clouds to 10Â m/s for high clouds.
