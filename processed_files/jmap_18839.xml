Annual emission of CO2 from gray forest soilsThe annual dynamics of the respiration rate of gray forest soil was determined in terrain conditions in forest, meadow, and agrocenoses using the closed chamber, incubation, and profile methods. Annual CO2 emission from the soil surface differed by three times depending on the ecosystem: from 180 g C/m(2) in the agrocenosis to 632 g C/m(2) in the forest. The CO2 emission during the growing season constituted 60-75% of the annual emission; the rest of the CO2 was released into the atmosphere during the cold season. The data on soil respiration obtained by the closed chamber method and by the profile method were in good agreement.
