Prey selection by the critically endangered Asiatic cheetah in central IranThe presence of the critically endangered Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus) has been verified in several protected areas in central Iran. Prey selection by the Asiatic cheetah was studied in Dare-Anjir Wildlife Refuge, one of its typical habitats in central Iran where there are no carnivorous competitors. The frequency of cheetah kills was compared with the relative abundance of each of its primary prey species obtained through two independent surveys. Jebeer gazelle (Gazella bennettii) was least abundant, but was the preferred prey of cheetah, whereas wild sheep (Ovis orientalis) followed by Persian ibex (Capra aegagrus) were the most frequently killed prey. Cheetahs selectively preyed on males of the three prey species. Our data suggest that Asiatic cheetahs prey mainly on mountain ungulates (wild sheep and Persian ibex), which has management implications for effective conservation of this taxon in Iran.
