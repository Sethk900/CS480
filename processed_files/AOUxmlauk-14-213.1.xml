This response, however, may not be a viable option for animals that are energetically compromised. Many single-species studies have shown that hungry animals select habitats within which foraging opportunities are greater even if predation pressures are higher, but it is unclear whether these patterns can be extrapolated to entire communities. Here, we examined the stopover habitat use of 28 frugivorous landbird species along the coast of Maine, USA, during an energetically demanding period of the annual cycle, fall migration. Across 6 stopover sites, we determined whether or not a tradeoff existed between using safe habitat patches (patches with high woody plant stem density) and patches with high food resources (patches with high fruit abundance). Controlling for raptor abundance at a site, landbird migrants were captured at higher rates in sites where no tradeoff existed, suggesting that birds avoided staying in sites where there was a predation risk&ndash;foraging tradeoff. At all sites, regardless of the presence or absence of a tradeoff, longer-distance migrants used patches with high food availability more frequently than shorter-distance migrants; patch use by shorter-distance migrants was explained by habitat cover alone. Our findings suggest that, for the Gulf of Maine, birds reduce predation risk at the scale of a stopover site, and differences in habitat selection at finer patch scales are mediated by migration strategy.  Mientras se alimentan, los animales frecuentemente balancean la alimentaci&oacute;n y la seguridad, reduciendo el consumo de alimentos como respuesta a un mayor riesgo de depredaci&oacute;n. Esta respuesta, sin embargo, puede no ser una opci&oacute;n viable para los animales que est&aacute;n energ&eacute;ticamente comprometidos. Muchos estudios de especies individuales han mostrado que los animales hambrientos seleccionan los h&aacute;bitats donde las oportunidades de forrajeo son mayores, incluso si las presiones de depredaci&oacute;n son m&aacute;s altas, pero no est&aacute; claro cu&aacute;n generalizable son estos patrones a las comunidades completas. Aqu&iacute; examinamos el uso del h&aacute;bitat de parada por parte de 28 especies de aves terrestres frug&iacute;voras a lo largo de la costa de Maine, EEUU, durante un per&iacute;odo energ&eacute;ticamente demandante del ciclo anual, la migraci&oacute;n de oto&ntilde;o. A lo largo de seis sitios de parada determinamos si exist&iacute;a o no un balance entre los parches de h&aacute;bitat seguros (parches con una alta densidad de tallos) y los parches con muchos recursos alimenticios (parches con una alta abundancia de frutos). Luego de controlar por la abundancia de rapaces en cada sitio, las aves migratorias terrestres presentaron mayores tasas de captura en los sitios sin un balance, sugiriendo que las aves evitan permanecer en los sitios donde existe un balance entre el riesgo de depredaci&oacute;n y el forrajeo. En todos los sitios, independientemente de la presencia de un balance, los migrantes de distancia m&aacute;s larga usaron m&aacute;s frecuentemente los parches con alta disponibilidad de alimentos, mientras que el uso de los parches por parte de los migrantes de menor distancia fue explicado solamente por la cobertura de h&aacute;bitat. Nuestros resultados sugieren que para el Golfo de Maine, las aves alivianan el riesgo de depredaci&oacute;n a la escala de sitio de parada, y las diferencias en la selecci&oacute;n de h&aacute;bitat a escalas m&aacute;s finas de parche est&aacute;n determinadas por la estrategia de migraci&oacute;n.   Palabras clave:  aves terrestres, depredaci&oacute;n, forrajeo, fruta, migraci&oacute;n, riesgo, sitio de parada, uso de h&aacute;bitat, vegetaci&oacute;n  Food acquisition and predator avoidance are fundamental components of the survival strategy of most animals ( Metcalfe and Furness 1984 ,  Houston et al. 1993 ,  Cowlishaw 1997 ,  Brown and Kotler 2004 ,  Hebblewhite and Merrill 2009 ). To maximize fitness, animals often trade off between foraging and either increased vigilance for predators ( Brown et al. 1999 ), flocking behavior ( Lindstr&ouml;m 1989 ), time spent in a patch ( Ydenberg et al. 2004 ), or crypsis (reduced rates of movement or protective cover;  Thaler et al. 2012 ). In situations in which animals are energetically constrained, however, the costs of reducing the time spent foraging to decrease predation risk may be prohibitively high ( Krebs 1980 ).  Predation risk can be a strong modifier of animal habitat selection (e.g.,  Lima 1988 ,  Gotceitas 1990 ,  Lindstr&ouml;m 1990 ,  Yasu&eacute; et al. 2003 ,  Hebblewhite and Merrill 2009 ,  Thaler et al. 2012 ). As a rule, animals choose feeding habitats that allow them to meet their energetic requirements while minimizing predation risk ( Yasu&eacute; et al. 2003 ), and avoid areas with high predation risk even if these areas would maximize foraging efficiency ( Gotceitas 1990 ,  Pomeroy et al. 2006 ). In times of higher-than-average energetic demand, however, added predation risk may be outweighed by the costs of decreased foraging efficiency in safer habitats.  Migration may be such a period, during which the tradeoff between foraging and predation risk shifts predictably. Migration is energetically expensive, and suitable habitats for rest and refueling are critical for successful migration ( Hutto 1985 ,  Moore et al. 1995 ,  Rodewald and Brittingham 2007 ). The large scale of migration further increases risks to survival, because individuals find themselves in unfamiliar environments with unknown predation pressures while trying to balance predator evasion ( Moore 1994 ) and food acquisition ( Moore and Aborn 2000 ) under higher-than-average energetic demand. Predation risk varies both spatially and temporally ( Sih 1992 ), so migrating animals must renegotiate the tradeoff between predation risk and energetic demand across a multitude of sites en route. Further, major landscape features (e.g., coastlines and water resources) are known to concentrate both migratory animals and their predators ( Aborn 1994 ,  Valeix et al. 2009 ). Therefore, the benefits of optimal behaviors are likely greatest at these choke points, as they concentrate landbirds (often before over-water flights) and their aerial predators ( Aborn 1994 ,  Schmaljohann and Dierschke 2004 ,  DeSorbo et al. 2012 ). Predator risk is thus increased at the same time as energetic demand.  Together, these added challenges during migration are likely to shift the optimal solution to the foraging vs. predator avoidance tradeoff. For example, studies of both passerine songbirds ( Moore 1994 ,  Cimprich et al. 2005 ) and charadriiform shorebirds ( Metcalfe and Furness 1984 ) have demonstrated that individuals in migratory condition decrease crypsis and vigilance relative to individuals that are not migrating.  Further, the high energetic demands of migration affect an individual's energy stores, which control behavioral responses to the predation risk&ndash;foraging tradeoff ( Cimprich and Moore 1999 ,  Pomeroy et al. 2008 ). Fat stores can alter flight performance ( Hedenstr&ouml;m 1992 ,  Cimprich and Moore 2006 ) and motivation to forage ( Krebs 1980 ), such that fatter birds increase vigilance while leaner birds take more risks ( Lima and Dill 1990 ,  Koivula et al. 1995 ,  Cimprich and Moore 2006 ).  Lindstr&ouml;m and Alerstam (1992) , however, state that each individual may have a &ldquo;set point,&rdquo; or optimal fuel load, at which point its motivation to forage decreases, which may disrupt any correlation between fuel load and antipredator behavior.  In this study, we assessed stopover habitat use by 28 species of passeriform and piciform birds (hereafter, &ldquo;landbirds&rdquo;) under the increased risk and energetic demand of migration along the coast. While single-species studies are invaluable for determining specific behavioral and physiological reactions to predation, it is difficult to translate that information into multispecies migration habitat conservation and management efforts. To understand the community-level response to tradeoffs between predation risk and foraging demand, we examined the habitat use of the entire migratory landbird community during fall migration along the coast of Maine, USA, at 2 types of stopover sites: (1) sites where the local habitat composition forces birds to make a tradeoff between predator avoidance and food availability, and (2) sites where such a tradeoff is not necessary. In sites of the first type, the habitat patches with the highest food availability have relatively little protective cover. In the second site type, birds do not face a tradeoff between predation avoidance and foraging, because the patches with the highest food availability are also the patches with the highest structural cover within the site. We used weekly relationships between fruit and cover to allow the presence (or absence) of a tradeoff between fruit availability and cover at a particular site to vary throughout the season as fruit availability changed.  Our study design explicitly tested how well fruit availability predicted habitat patch use within a stopover site each week as a function of: (1) the structural cover present within the same patch, (2) whether the stopover site as a whole possessed or lacked characteristics forcing a tradeoff between cover and fruit availability, and (3) the site-level abundance of avian predators. Further, because we examined all 28 commonly caught species in our migrant community, we were able to assess whether migration distance, which likely influences energetic demand ( Bairlein and Gwinner 1994 ), affected the interactions among these 3 patch- and site-level covariates.  Specifically, we predicted that birds presented with a tradeoff between fruit availability and cover would accept more risk (use patches with relatively less cover) than those not facing such a tradeoff, given the high energetic demand of migration. Further, we expected that low raptor abundance would increase the impact of fruit availability on patch use within sites requiring a tradeoff, relative to sites not requiring a tradeoff. Finally, we predicted that these 2 differences between tradeoff and nontradeoff sites would be greater for species with longer migration distances, as they are presented with the greatest energetic constraints.  We sampled fall-migrating landbirds and their stopover habitat in the DownEast and MidCoast regions of Maine during 2011&ndash;2012 at 6 monitoring stations, including 2 coastal headland and 4 island sites ( Figure 1 ). We considered each monitoring station as a largely independent stopover site. Each station was no closer than 10 km to the nearest station (mean nearest station distance &plusmn; SE &equals; 23 &plusmn; 10 km; mean pairwise distance among all stations &equals; 46 &plusmn; 9 km). Within each of our monitoring sites we sampled habitat use through bird captures, using passive mist nets placed in a variety of different habitat types (see below).  Locations of 6 landbird migration monitoring sites within the DownEast and MidCoast regions of Maine, USA.  We defined a 4-m buffer area around each mist net as a habitat patch within the stopover site. Within each site, nets were placed 4&ndash;398 m apart (&mu; &plusmn; SE &equals; 119 &plusmn; 3 m). Four-meter-wide belt transects were established parallel to each net. While capture within a patch does not require that an individual be using a patch for foraging or crypsis (e.g., passage use during movement between patches), capture rates should increase as individuals spend longer within a patch, and there is no reason to suspect that any other type of use would correlate with either structural cover or fruit availability. Capture rates should thus serve as an adequate index of patch use.  We sampled 3 islands with sizes of 0.75 km 2  (Great Duck Island, 2011), 1.30 km 2  (Metinic Island, 2011), and 280 km 2  (Mount Desert Island). We sampled 2 locations on Mount Desert Island, one at the southern-most coastal headland (Seawall, 2011&ndash;2012) and one 16 km to the north in the interior of the island (McFarland Hill, 2011). The 3 islands varied in their distance from the nearest mainland (Mount Desert Island &equals; 1 km, Metinic Island &equals; 8 km, and Great Duck Island &equals; 23 km). We also sampled the headlands of 2 peninsulas: Schoodic Peninsula (2012) and Petit Manan Point (2011&ndash;2012). The entire sampled region stretched 114 km, from Metinic Island in the southeast to Petit Manan Point in the northeast. All 6 migration stations possessed 4 broad vegetation types: forest dominated by  Picea  species (with  Alnus, Larix ,  Betula ,  Acer , and  Populus  species); shrubland dominated by  Alnus, Aronia, Sorbus , and  Ilex  species; mowed or grazed grassland; and a mixture of edge habitats among these broader types. The monitoring stations were all located on protected conservation lands and operated in collaboration with researchers at Acadia National Park, the Maine Coastal Islands National Wildlife Refuge, The Nature Conservancy, and the University of Maine.  We surveyed migrant landbirds during fall migration in 2011 (August 16 to October 28) and 2012 (August 18 to October 18) using passive mist-netting. Nets were opened 30 min before sunrise and closed 6 hr after opening, weather conditions permitting. The specific nets and the total number of nets opened on any given day varied with weather conditions, most commonly with the presence of strong winds or rain. The number of nets at each site ranged from 14 to 20. The range of site area (summed 4-m buffer areas around all nets) was 2,143&ndash;2,912 m 2 . We fit all captured birds with a uniquely numbered aluminum band.  Foraging habitat use was defined as the number of birds caught per week for each species, patch, and year. Birds recaptured within the same season were excluded from the dataset. Due to the difficulty of separating resident and migratory individuals, we removed all species found year-round at our sites from analyses. We also removed all species whose diet during migration did not include fruit, because we used fruit availability as our index of food resources. Species' diets were determined using previous categorizations created from 3 sources ( Parrish 1997 ,  Suomala et al. 2010 ,  www.allaboutbirds.org ). We further excluded species when we captured fewer than 50 birds across all sites and years, because rare species introduced many zero weekly capture counts, causing overdispersion of the data. To account for the hierarchical nature of habitat selection by migratory birds ( Hutto 1985 ), we kept all zero counts at nets when species were caught in that net sometime during the migration season (i.e. birds were available to use the patch, but the patch was not selected during a given time period). However, we dropped all zero counts at nets when a given species was either never captured in that site during a given year (i.e. birds never selected the site and were therefore unavailable to select a patch secondarily) or never captured in that net during any time period within the year (i.e. birds may have selected the site, but it was impossible to distinguish between the lack of patch selection due to a preference for another patch and the lack of patch selection due to its unsuitability for the species' niche more broadly).  Together with species, age, sex, and morphological measurements, the amount of subcutaneous fat in the furculum and abdomen was recorded. Fat was scored on a scale of 0 to 5: 0 &equals; none; 0.5 &equals; trace; 1 &equals; lining furculum; 2 &equals; filling furculum; 3 &equals; mounded in furculum and beginning to cover abdomen; 4 &equals; mounded on breast and sides of abdomen; 5 &equals; covering breast and abdomen (no or very little skin visible). Although individual fat load has been shown to affect antipredator behavior and foraging in other migration studies, we did not include a metric for individual energy reserves in our analysis. Preliminary data exploration indicated that there was not a biologically significant difference in the mean fat scores across tradeoff vs. nontradeoff sites (&mu; &plusmn; SD: tradeoff group &equals; 1.46 &plusmn; 1.75; nontradeoff group &equals; 1.06 &plusmn; 1.37). Therefore, any reported differences between patch use at tradeoff and nontradeoff sites could not be attributed to a difference in the mean energy reserves of the population selecting patches.  Landbird species differ in their energetic constraints and consequently in their habitat needs during migration stopover ( Moore et al. 1995 ). These differences in energetic needs may drive differential habitat use by species. We included each species' migration distance as a potential predictor of habitat use to capture this variation in energetic demand. Migration distance was calculated by obtaining each species' most northerly and most southerly nonbreeding range limits based on Cornell Lab of Ornithology range maps ( www.allaboutbirds.org ), determining the latitudinal midpoint of each species' nonbreeding range, and calculating the latitudinal distance from the capture region to this midpoint ( McCabe and Olsen 2015 ). This method provided an estimate (as a continuous variable) of the median distance left to travel for each species.  Predation pressure was measured in the field by recording all birds of prey seen utilizing (not merely flying over) the migration banding stations during the hours of banding operation. As our raptor abundance variable we used a weekly raptor total for each banding site divided by the total number of hours that nets were open at each site to control for varying effort. The most common avian predator species observed at our sites were Merlin (  Falco columbarius  ), Sharp-shinned Hawk (  Accipiter striatus  ), and Peregrine Falcon (  F. peregrinus  ), predators that do not hunt in dense cover ( Raim et al. 1989 ,  Niles et al. 1996 ,  Fransson and Weber 1997 ).  Within each habitat patch, two 4-m-wide belt transects running parallel to the net were established. These transects were placed outside the areas directly affected by the maintenance of the net lanes.  Woody stem density was measured down the center of each 4-m belt transect by counting stems in 1-m intervals at 2 heights (0.5 m and 1.5 m). We then summed the stem counts across both transects along each net for each height and averaged the sums from the 2 heights to provide us with a single continuous stem density count per patch.  We used ripe fruit abundance as a measure of food availability. While the use of patches with high fruit abundance does not necessitate that birds are foraging on fruit, there are few obvious alternative behavioral mechanisms that could produce a positive relationship between patch use and fruit availability among frugivorous birds that are not related to foraging behavior (or indirectly to flocking behavior of birds foraging on fruit), especially once habitat structure is controlled for (using the multivariate approaches described below).  We recorded ripe fruit abundance weekly along the 2 belt transects for each mist net. We assessed fruit abundance for several shrub species, including black chokeberry ( Photinia melanocarpa ), wild raisin ( Viburnum nudum ), pin cherry (  Prunus pensylvanica  ), lowbush and highbush blueberry (  Vaccinium angustifolium   and   Vaccinium corymbosum  ), black huckleberry ( Gaylussacia baccata ) and 2  Rubus  species. We excluded bayberry (  Myrica pensylvanica  ) because only 1 species, the Yellow-rumped Warbler ( Setophaga coronata ), is able to digest its waxy fruits ( Place and Stiles 1992 ,  Borgmann et al. 2004 ). Black chokeberry, wild raisin, and pin cherry comprised the majority of fruiting species at all sites. The numbers of individual fruits were estimated for each species using a modified scale with 8 abundance categories, first developed by  Smith and McWilliams (2009) . Abundance categories were defined as: 1 &equals; &le;10 ripe fruits, 2 &equals; 11&ndash;25 ripe fruits, 3 &equals; 26&ndash;100 ripe fruits, 4 &equals; 101&ndash;250 ripe fruits, 5 &equals; 251&ndash;1,000 ripe fruits, 6 &equals; 1,001&ndash;3,000 ripe fruits, 7 &equals; 3,001&ndash;10,000 ripe fruits, and 8 &equals; &ge;10,000 ripe fruits. To obtain our continuous fruit availability variable we summed the categorical midpoints of estimated ripe fruit abundance across both transects for each week.  For each week, we modeled ripe fruit availability as a function of stem density across all habitat patches for each site using quantile regression (&tau; &equals; 0.80), using the R package &lsquo;quantreg' ( R Development Core Team 2012 ,  Koenker 2013 ). We used quantile regression to describe the relationship between the 80 th  percentile of fruit availability for a given stem density. This allowed us to identify sites with patches that had both high cover and abundant fruit vs. sites that lacked such patches during a given week. Site-weeks (hereafter, &ldquo;sites&rdquo;) for which there was a negative relationship between fruit availability and stem density were labeled as tradeoff sites, and sites with a positive relationship were categorized as nontradeoff sites. Although banding stations had similar broad habitats, fruiting plant species diversity, abundance, and fruiting phenology differed within and among sites. By modeling weekly relationships between fruit and cover, we thus allowed patches to exhibit tradeoffs between fruit availability and cover variably through time with patch fruiting phenology.  Based on a priori hypotheses about the differences in foraging habitat use between tradeoff and nontradeoff sites, we constructed a set of candidate models. We then used model selection to determine which combination of predictors best explained patch use and whether use differed for sites that did or did not require a tradeoff between food and cover. To test our hypotheses we constructed a series of generalized linear mixed effects models, with weekly species counts modeled as a negative binomial distribution with a log-link function and an offset of weekly net hours (to account for effort). We used a negative binomial distribution to account for overdispersion and zero-inflation in our capture data. We repeatedly measured captures of 28 species at 144 patches weekly over 2 yr; therefore, species and patch identity were included as random effects. We fit the generalized linear negative binomial mixed models with the R package &lsquo;lme4&prime; ( Bates et al. 2014 ). All models included year and week as fixed effects to account for the differences between years and to control for variation in the phenology of the migratory community. Weekly fruit availability measurements were heavily skewed, thus we square-root-transformed the variable. The relationship between bird abundance and week was nonlinear; therefore, we added a quadratic term for week in all models. As our hypotheses were concerned only with relative foraging patch use for the migratory community in sites that did or did not require a tradeoff between food and cover, we did not disentangle differences in captures due to true abundance vs. detection probability. We should note, however, that our methods assume that detection probability is similar within a given site, year, and species for all nets within a site.  The candidate model set consisted of 8 models ( Table 1 ). All models aside from the null model included year (2011 or 2012), week (linear and quadratic terms), fruit availability, tradeoff (yes or no), raptor abundance, stem density, and migration distance as single variables. Additive models of these single variables described each variable's overall effect on patch use. For example, fruit availability as a single variable only explained whether more or fewer birds were captured at patches with varying fruit availability. To test our hypotheses that the relationship between bird use and fruit availability varied with risk and migration strategy, we used a series of 2- and 3-way interactions.  Model selection results for all models explaining migrating landbird stopover use of patches on the coast of Maine, USA, 2011&ndash;2012. Models were ranked based on the difference from the top model in AIC value (&Delta;AIC). Also presented are the log-likelihood (&minus;2In L ), number of parameters ( K ), and model weights ( w i  ). All models include the variables &ldquo;year&rdquo; and &ldquo;week.&rdquo; &ldquo;Fruit Avail.&rdquo; is an index of ripe fruit abundance within a habitat patch; &ldquo;Tradeoff&rdquo; indicates whether or not there is a negative relationship between stem density and fruit abundance among patches within a site during a given week; &ldquo;Stem Den.&rdquo; is an index of vegetative cover within a patch; &ldquo;Migration Dist.&rdquo; is the median latitudinal distance left to travel from the study region to the midpoint of the wintering grounds for each species; and &ldquo;Raptor Abund.&rdquo; is an index of predation risk to landbirds at each site during a given week.  Specifically, the model set contained: (1) 3 models, each with one 2-way interaction between fruit availability and either stem density, migration distance, or raptor abundance; (2) three 3-way interaction models formed by interacting tradeoff with each of the 2-way interactions above (plus their associated 2-way interactions and main effects); (3) one model containing only the single variables (fruit availability, migration distance, tradeoff status, stem density, and raptor abundance); and (4) a null model, containing only year and week as fixed effects. The three 2-way interactions tested whether the relationship between fruit availability and patch use varied by risk (indicated by raptor abundance and the inverse of stem density) and energetic strategy (indicated by migration distance). The 3-way interactions then tested whether any of these relationships differed between sites that did or did not require a tradeoff between food and cover.  We standardized all of our continuous candidate variables by subtracting the mean and dividing them by the standard deviation. By standardizing the variables we could directly compare the parameter estimates among our candidate variables to describe the strength of the difference between tradeoff and nontradeoff sites.  We used Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) to rank models based on their ability to explain variance in the data, and used Akaike weights ( w i  ) to estimate the relative likelihood of each model given the data ( Burnham and Anderson 2002 ). We considered models with differences in AIC values (&Delta;AIC) &lt;2.0 to be equivalent ( Burnham and Anderson 2002 ). We assessed model fit (including the random variables) by calculating the conditional  R  2 . We used the &ldquo;Wald&rdquo; method to calculate 95&percnt; confidence intervals around the parameter estimates from the top model.  During the 2011 and 2012 fall migration seasons, we captured 9,649 migrant birds belonging to 28 species of 7 families. We operated nets for 27,544 hr over 144 net-years. The number of sampling days for each site during a given year ranged from 33 to 55 days (&mu; &plusmn; SE &equals; 43 &plusmn; 3 days). Yearly net effort for individual banding stations ranged from 2,122 to 4,363 net-hours. The weekly predation pressure averaged 0.033 (SD &equals; 0.004,  n  &equals; 24 site-weeks, range &equals; 0&ndash;50 raptors per site-week) and 0.005 (SD &equals; 0.036,  n  &equals; 35 site-weeks, range &equals; 0&ndash;11 raptors per site-week) raptors per net-hour for 2011 and 2012, respectively.  A tradeoff between cover and fruit availability was present during 15 site-weeks, and a tradeoff was absent during 46 site-weeks. Fruit availability and stem density differed between years and by tradeoff group. Stem density varied between years because the sites operated varied between the 2 years. Fruit availability was higher in 2011 (&mu; &plusmn; SE &equals; 21.76 &plusmn; 1.56 fruit per effort) than in 2012 (6.74 &plusmn; 0.72), and higher among tradeoff sites (22.17 &plusmn; 2.44) vs. nontradeoff sites (13.27 &plusmn; 1.02). Stem density was slightly lower among patches measured in 2011 (7.29 &plusmn; 0.22 stems) than in 2012 (7.97 &plusmn; 0.22), and lower in the tradeoff sites (6.19 &plusmn; 0.30) vs. the nontradeoff sites (8.05 &plusmn; 0.18).  Our top-ranked model predicting variation in patch use contained a 2-way interaction between fruit availability and migration distance (and the associated main effects), controlling for the single variables of raptor abundance, tradeoff status, stem density, year, and week (model weight &equals; 0.82;  Table 1 ). Our final model fit the data reasonably well (conditional  R  2  &equals; 0.40) and was not overdispersed, with a ratio of the sum of squared Pearson's residuals to residual degrees of freedom of 1.08.  Within the top-ranked model we found important effects of week, year, tradeoff status, raptor abundance, stem density, and the interaction between fruit availability and migration distance ( Table 2 ). The variable having the largest effect on predicted capture rates was week; captures increased toward the beginning of the season at all sites and decreased at the end ( Table 2 ). Model-predicted capture rates were higher in nontradeoff sites (&mu; &plusmn; SE &equals; 0.018 &plusmn; 0.000) than in tradeoff sites (0.011 &plusmn; 0.000) during 2011 and 2012 (nontradeoff: 0.011 &plusmn; 0.000, tradeoff: 0.009 &plusmn; 0.000), and in sites with high raptor abundance ( Table 2 ). Controlling for all other factors, birds preferred patches with higher stem densities ( Table 2 ). Fruit availability had little effect on the capture rates of shorter-distance migrants; however, as migration distance increased, species were captured more and more preferentially in patches with high fruit availability ( Table 2 ,  Figure 2 ).

Effect of fruit availability (square-root transformed) on predicted capture rates (&plusmn; 95&percnt; CI) of 4 different migratory landbird guilds (defined by quartiles of the latitudinal distance from our study region to the midpoint of the nonbreeding season range) at 6 stopover sites on the coast of Maine, USA, 2011&ndash;2012.  Animals have repeatedly been shown to modify their foraging choices to reflect both foraging success and predation risk ( Lima and Dill 1990 ). In situations in which individuals are food-deprived or engaged in energetically costly events, however, they may make more &ldquo;risky&rdquo; foraging decisions ( Metcalfe and Furness 1984 ,  Pomeroy et al. 2008 ). In a community of species actively engaged in migration, we predicted that capture rates would be higher in patches with higher fruit abundance among sites where individuals had to choose between patches with high food availability or high cover. Further, we predicted that in sites that did not require a tradeoff, capture rates would be positively correlated with both fruit abundance and cover. Instead, we found that birds preferentially used patches with high cover regardless of the presence (or absence) of a tradeoff within the site, once we controlled for predator abundance. Further, fruit availability was only predictive of patch use among the longest-distance migrants, again regardless of the presence or absence of a tradeoff between food availability and cover. Overall bird abundance, however, was highest in sites without a tradeoff.  Migrants approaching stopover are constantly assessing their surroundings and making decisions at finer and finer spatial scales ( Hutto 1985 ). Our results are consistent with this hierarchical stopover decision-making process, and suggest that site selection may be more important than patch selection for explaining habitat use at timescales of a week or greater. We hypothesize that migrants rapidly assess the relative safety and productivity of a site, departing sites more rapidly if there is a tradeoff between foraging and safety. Assuming similar landing densities among our sites, longer stopover times at higher quality sites would explain the patterns that we report here.  Patch use among longer-distance migrants was explained by fruit availability across all sites ( Figure 2 ), which is concordant with our assumption that these birds have higher energetic demands (i.e. are likely to accept more risk during foraging). This pattern could also be explained by a bias in more specialized frugivory (during migration) among the longest-distance migrants. Given the advantages of a more frugivorous diet during stopover that have been reported for a number of landbird species ( Parrish 1997 ,  2000 ,  Bairlein 1998 ,  Long and Stouffer 2003 ,  Newton 2008 ), long-distance migrants may select habitats that are higher in fruit resources, regardless of their diet during nonmigratory periods, in order to gain weight more efficiently during stopover. Such behavior minimizes the time spent on stopover, in turn shortening total migratory passage time, and is one of the hallmarks of a &ldquo;time minimizer&rdquo; migration strategy ( Alerstam and Lindstr&ouml;m 1990 ,  Hedenstr&ouml;m and Alerstam 1997 ). Short-distance migrants are generally assumed to be less constrained by time and to depart stopover sites with lower mass loads ( Hedenstr&ouml;m and Alerstam 1997 ). Doing so allows them to be more cautious on stopover ( Metcalfe and Furness 1984 ) and also increases their escape velocity and maneuverability ( Kullberg et al. 1996 ), both of which lessen predation risk at a cost to migration time ( Alerstam and Lindstr&ouml;m 1990 ,  Seewagen and Guglielmo 2010 ). Here we support this overall paradigm, showing that shorter-distance migrants prioritized patches with high cover (low predation risk) at all sites, whereas longer-distance migrants compromised between cover and food availability when presented with a tradeoff.  It is important to note that our measure of fruit availability was a weekly calculation, and that the timing and composition of fruiting plants at a stopover site may vary at even finer timescales. However, using similar data collected in the same sites as this study,  Olsen et al. (2015)  found that food resource phenology, along with other ephemeral resources (deciduous leaf drop and soil moisture), predicted patch use throughout the migration season better than static habitat structure (i.e. vegetation cover and height). Ripe fruit abundance was positively associated with the capture rates of Parulidae, Emberizidae, and Vireonidae, but was unrelated to capture rates of Tyrannidae. Results from  Olsen et al. (2015)  and this study confirm the importance of within-season variation in resource availability for predicting migrating songbird habitat use.  Vegetation structure is an essential factor shaping birds' habitat choices ( Wiens and Rotenberry 1981 ), as it can provide information regarding shelter from predators ( Sapir et al. 2004 ,  Deppe and Rotenberry 2008 ). To assess habitat use of the migrant community, we used woody stem density as a proxy for protection from predation risk, where high stem density was assumed to equate to lower predation risk ( Savino and Stein 1989 ). It is possible that individuals utilize other characteristics to select cover, such as percent vegetation cover or height, when seeking protection. Vegetation cover, height, and density, however, are often highly correlated ( Vitz and Rodewald 2007 ), although this remains untested at our study sites. Previous fall migration studies have found correlations between stem density and bird abundance ( Rodewald and Brittingham 2002 ,  Suthers et al. 2000 ), although whether these correlations can be attributed to perceived protection or an association with food resources is unknown.  Cimprich et al. (2005)  found that both American Redstarts (  Setophaga ruticilla  ) and Blue-gray Gnatcatchers (  Polioptila caerulea  ) moved deeper into shrubs when presented with a predation risk, demonstrating that migrants are indeed relying on vegetation as protection and perceive increased cover as increased protection. Additional behavioral studies are needed to determine the precise behavioral mechanisms responsible for the patch associations presented here.  Across all sites, capture rates were higher in sites with greater raptor abundance.  Aborn (1994)  also found a positive correlation between raptor and landbird abundances during spring migration along the Gulf of Mexico coastline. Correlations in abundance may be due to migratory behaviors that are similar across both avian groups, to predator movements tracking prey resources, or both. Beneficial weather patterns for migrating raptors are also advantageous for migrating landbirds ( Moore and Kerlinger 1987 ,  Aborn 1994 ,  Woltmann and Cimprich 2003 ); neither group prefers to fly into a headwind or heavy precipitation. Also, landbird abundance along the Gulf of Maine is directly proportional to the amount of vegetated land available for stopover at the scale of a few kilometers ( McCabe and Olsen 2015 ). It is reasonable to assume that similar behavioral processes are at work among raptor species. Since landbirds are an important food source for migrating raptors ( Aborn 1994 ,  Ydenberg et al. 2007 ), raptor movements also might track the abundance of their prey. For these reasons we hypothesize that increased landbird captures at high-abundance raptor sites are not related to landbird movements in response to raptor abundance. If, however, landbirds are unable to avoid sites with high raptor abundance due to these mechanisms, avoiding sites with a tradeoff between cover and food might be the adaptive solution to a constraint imposed by predation.  Migration is a critical event in the life cycle of most North American landbirds. With increases in both predation risk and energetic demand relative to stationary periods of the annual cycle, migration is inherently costly ( Moore et al. 1995 ). Balancing predator avoidance with foraging is critical because of direct mortality risk and the costs of arriving late to either nonbreeding or breeding grounds ( Moore 1994 ). We suggest that migrating landbirds universally prioritize habitat patches with high cover, but avoid sites where this cover is not correlated with the presence of food resources. Further, increased energetic demand (as indicated by migration distance) is associated with increased use of patches with abundant food resources, regardless of cover. Our community-scale results thus corroborate past single-species behavioral research demonstrating that migrants prioritize foraging when energetic demand is high ( Metcalfe and Furness 1984 ,  Yasu&eacute; et al. 2003 ,  Hebblewhite and Merrill 2009 ).  Important stopover habitat for the entire migratory community may be difficult to define ( Hutto 2000 ). However, in this study we found that, when given the opportunity, migrants preferred habitats with both high vegetative protection and abundant fruit resources. Both resources are typically found in edge-dominated, early successional habitats, which are not considered high-quality breeding habitat for many of the species that we studied here ( Rodewald and Brittingham 2007 ,  Vitz and Rodewald 2007 ,  Suomala et al. 2010 ). Thus, landbird conservation efforts should consider not only prime breeding habitat, but also habitat where migrants can find protection from aerial predators while efficiently and safely refueling. Additionally, habitats with fruit resources that occur during the migration seasons may be particularly important. More study is needed to quantify the costs to bird condition and survival in sites that lack these resources.
