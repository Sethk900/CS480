A Study on the Diet of Minor Grisons and a Preliminary Analysis of Their Role in the Control of Rabbits in PatagoniaDespite their wide-spread distribution and abundance, grisons (Galictis cuja) are one of the least known carnivore in the Neotropics. We studied their diet in North-western Patagonia, and evaluated their potential impact on European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Rabbits invaded Argentina from Chile between 1945 and 1950 and have since rapidly expanded southwards along the river valleys of North-western Patagonia. We compared the diet of grisons between sites of similar environmental characteristics that differed in the abundance of rabbits by analysis of their scats. Grisons preyed primarily upon mammals (lagomorphs and cricetids), and secondarily upon birds and reptiles. They hunt almost exclusively on lagomorphs when the density of rabbits is high. This result indicates that grisons may be important predators of rabbits and therefore further studies are warranted to confirm their role in the control of rabbits in Patagonia.
