Paleosols and Holocene soils occurring over the North Mountain basalt in Nova Scotia and Grand Manan Island, CanadaOn the northwest coast of Nova Scotia, the North Mountain basalt makes a major contribution to local lithology. On this formation, there are occurrences of pre-Wisconsinan saprolite which has survived one or more periods of glaciation. Holocene weathering has produced Brunisolic soils (Inceptisols) on the saprolite and a variety of soil types on the till covering this formation. The clay-sized fraction of the pre-Wisconsinan saprolite is almost wholly smectitic and weathering has only slightly changed its composition. Although the till formed over the basalt contains only basaltic fragments, the clay-sized fractions have a variety of mica-type clay minerals which are not significantly dissimilar to those developed in a soil profile occurring in till over neighbouring granite.
