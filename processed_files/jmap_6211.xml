Evaluation of plant resistance to the maize stalk borer, Busseola fusca (Fuller) in maize germplasm improved for resistance to other borer speciesNineteen maize genotypes resistant to various stalk borer species were evaluated for resistance to the maize stalk borer, Busseola fusca (Fuller), using artificially infested plants grown in a greenhouse. The inbred line GT-FAWCC (C5) resistant to the fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (Smith) was identified as a new source of high level leaf feeding resistance to B. fusca, whereas the inbred GT115 resistant to the corn earworm Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) presented a source of resistance to ear feeding by B. fusca. The latter is the first record of resistance to B. fusca not derived from an Antigua Group 2 background.
