Vocalization and territorial behaviour of Phyllomedusa nordestina Caramaschi, 2006 (Anura: Hylidae) from southern Bahia, BrazilTerritoriality is common among amphibians with a prolonged breeding season and can be expressed through the defence of territories with vocalizations and aggressive interactions. The present study aims to describe the territorial behaviour of male Phyllomedusa nordestina, test whether the physical characteristics of males influence the results of disputes, and describe the vocalizations of the species. The study was conducted at temporary and permanent ponds located in the Ecological Reserve Michelin, Igrapiúna, Bahia, Brazil. Male P. nordestina defended territories and showed aggressive behaviour, consisting of vocal disputes, chasing and physical fighting. Winners were not bigger, heavier, or in better condition than the losers. The victory may be associated with the vocalization activity. Three types of vocalizations were recorded: the advertisement call, composed of one or two multipulsed notes, and two types of territorial calls. We also report on male patrolling behaviour and habitat use.
