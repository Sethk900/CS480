Growth responses of inbred maize lines with high and low DIMBOA (benzoxazinone) contents to atrazineThe growth response of five inbred maize lines with high and low DIMBOA content were compared in the presence of 3 and 12 ppm atrazine. A growth-promoting effect of atrazine on roots, mesocotyls and coleoptiles was observed in dark-grown seedlings of the low DIMBOA concentration lines, whereas virtually no effect could be detected in high DIMBOA concentration lines.
