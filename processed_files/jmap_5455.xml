Three new species and one new record of the genus Doryphoribius Pilato, 1969 (Tardigrada: Eutardigrada: Hypsibiidae) from the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Tennessee, USA)Three new eutardigrades, Doryphoribius longistipes sp. nov., Doryphoribius minimus sp. nov. and Doryphoribius tergumrudis sp. nov., are described from stream periphyton, rock lichen and cave soil and leaf litter samples collected in the limestoneâ€based Cades Cove area of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in eastern Tennessee, USA. Doryphoribius longistipes sp. nov. differs from other species mainly by the higher ratio of the secondary to the primary claw branches. Doryphoribius minimus sp. nov. differs from D. gibber, D. mariae and D. vietnamensis mainly by its smaller body size and different arrangement of dorsal gibbosities. Doryphoribius tergumrudis sp. nov. differs from D. evelinae by the absence of gibbosities and tubercles on legs Iâ€“III, the presence of lunulae and the absence of eyes. Additionally the three new species differ from other congeners by some other morphological and morphometric characters. Another species, Doryphoribius doryphorus Binda and Pilato, 1969, is a new record for Tennessee.
