Integrating visible, near-infrared and short-wave infrared hyperspectral and multispectral thermal imagery for geological mapping at Cuprite, NevadaThis study investigated the potential value of integrating hyperspectral visible, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared imagery with multispectral thermal data for geological mapping. Two coregistered aerial data sets of Cuprite, Nevada were used: Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) hyperspectral data, and MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator (MASTER) multispectral thermal data. Four classification methods were each applied to AVIRIS, MASTER, and a combined set. Confusion matrices were used to assess the classification accuracy. The assessment showed, in terms of kappa coefficient, that most classification methods applied to the combined data achieved a marked improvement compared to the results using either AVIRIS or MASTER thermal infrared (TIR) data alone. Spectral angle mapper (SAM) showed the best overall classification performance. Minimum distance classification had the second best accuracy, followed by spectral feature fitting (SFF) and maximum likelihood classification. The results of the study showed that SFF applied to the combination of AVIRIS with MASTER TIR data are especially valuable for identification of silicified alteration and quartzite, both of which exhibit distinctive features in the TIR region. SAM showed some advantages over SFF in dealing with multispectral TIR data, obtaining higher accuracy in discriminating low albedo volcanic rocks and limestone which do not have unique, distinguishing features in the TIR region.
