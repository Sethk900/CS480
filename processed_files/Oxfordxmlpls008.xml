These vacuoles function to the support rapid cell elongation of the hypocotyl that results in radicle emergence and thus the start of visible germination.In tropical recalcitrant seeds, their rapid transition from shedding to germination at high hydration level is of physiological interest but difficult to study because of the time constraint. In recalcitrant horse chestnut seeds produced in central Russia, this transition is much longer and extends through dormancy and dormancy release. This extended time period permits studies of the water relations in embryonic axes during the long recalcitrant period in terms of vacuolar status and water transport.Horse chestnut (<italic>Aesculus hippocastanum</italic>) seeds sampled in Moscow were stratified in cold wet sand for 4 months. Vacuole presence and development in embryonic axes were examined by vital staining, light and electron microscopy. Aquaporins and vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase were identified immunochemically. Water channel operation was tested by water inflow rate. Vacuolar acid invertase was estimated in terms of activity and electrophoretic properties.Throughout the long recalcitrant period after seed shedding, cells of embryonic axes maintained active vacuoles and a high water content. Preservation of enzyme machinery in vacuoles was evident from retention of invertase activity, substrate specificity, molecular mass and subunit composition. Plasmalemma and tonoplast aquaporins and the E subunit of vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase were also present. In non-dormant seeds prior to growth initiation, vacuoles enlarged at first in hypocotyls, and then in radicles, with their biogenesis being similar. Vacuolation was accompanied by increasing invertase activity, leading to sugar accumulation and active osmotic functioning. After growth initiation, vacuole enlargement was favoured by enhanced water inflow through water channels formed by aquaporins.Maintenance of high water content and desiccation sensitivity, as well as preservation of active vacuoles in embryonic axes after shedding, can be considered a specific feature of recalcitrant seeds, overlooked when studying tropical recalcitrants due to the short duration. The retained physiological activity of vacuoles allows them to function rapidly as dormancy is lost and when external conditions permit. Cell vacuolation precedes cell elongation in both hypocotyl and radicle, and provides impetus for rapid germination.Modern-day seed biology recognizes two types of seeds, namely orthodox and recalcitrant seeds. These differ in their tolerance to desiccation during maturation. The term ‘orthodox seeds’ embraces maturing seeds, which tolerate desiccation without damage and remain viable at water contents as low as 8–10 %, on a fresh weight basis. In contrast, recalcitrant seeds are damaged by water loss and die quickly if water levels decline to 40–65 % (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C41">Steadman <italic>et al</italic>. 1996</xref>). Thus, they are desiccation sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C4">Berjak and Pammenter 2008</xref>). In other words, recalcitrant seeds undergo little or no maturation drying and remain desiccation sensitive during maturation and after shedding. Such a large difference in response to dehydration has attracted research interest for at least 30 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C36">Pammenter and Berjak 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C17">Kermode and Finch-Savage 2002</xref>). Recently, it was found that desiccation-induced damage was caused by a dehydration-driven burst of reactive oxygen species in embryonic axes accompanied by the ineffective development of antioxidant systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C38">Pukacka and Ratajczak 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C5">Cheng and Song 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C39">Roach <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C40">2010</xref>).Seeds of tropical and subtropical forest species are typically recalcitrant, and have very short intervals between shedding and germination. This makes the study of recalcitrance difficult. A high water content (40–65 %) was recorded in embryonic axes of 12 such species while the water content in cotyledons was 10 % lower than this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C41">Steadman <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>). Water potentials in four seed species were found to be high and within the range −1.5 to −2.5 MPa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C45">Walters 2000</xref>). A high water content can indicate the presence of vacuoles; however, cell vacuolation in embryonic axes has not been adequately studied until now. In mature seeds of tropical <italic>Araucaria angustifolia</italic> (woody gymnosperm) and <italic>Landolpha kirkii</italic> (woody dicot), the radicles were found to contain no vacuoles or vacuoles comprising not more than 3 % of cell cross-sectional area, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C9">Farrant <italic>et al</italic>. 1989</xref>). In cotyledons of <italic>Scadoxus membranaceus</italic> (tropical grass), vacuoles occupied ∼25 % of cell cross-sectional area. In <italic>Avicenna marina</italic>, a tropical mangrove, small vacuoles were found in radicle meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C23">Motete <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>) with large vacuoles only in cotyledons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C10">Farrant <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>). In no case were vacuoles studied in embryonic axes after seed shedding and the time leading up to germination.Recalcitrant seeds are distinguished by high water content in their embryonic axes. We aimed at prolonging the period between shedding and germination of recalcitrant seeds in order to characterize their water status. Earlier attempts to prolong mature seed lifespan by long-term storage under conditions preventing water loss have resulted in seed deterioration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C9">Farrant <italic>et al</italic>. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C23">Motete <italic>et al</italic>. 1997</xref>). We therefore studied recalcitrant seeds of horse chestnut (<italic>Aesculus hippocastanum)</italic> trees growing in central Russia. These were chosen because the period between shedding and germination is long. Horse chestnut originated in the Balkan mountains and gradually spread over much of Europe after the last ice age. The spread north from Greece to Scotland was accompanied by a reduction in seed size and water content, and faster seed maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C7">Daws <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). In horse chestnut growing to the north of southern England, seeds do not germinate after shedding in autumn because of low temperatures. Instead, such seeds enter dormancy and need a short cold stratification to enable germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C37">Pritchard <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>). In contrast, in central Russia, shedding of horse chestnut seeds takes place after almost 5 months of seed development. These seeds are mature and excised embryonic axes can germinate in 3 days under optimum laboratory conditions. Mature seeds possess a thick dense wax coating, a fully differentiated embryonic axis consisting of radicle, hypocotyl and plumule, and large massive cotyledons rich in starch. Intact shed seeds respond to cold winter temperatures by a long deep dormancy and need a cold wet stratification of 16–18 weeks to germinate. Dormancy is due mainly to a long coat-imposed dormancy and can be relieved by cytokinin application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C28">Obroucheva and Antipova 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C31">Obroucheva and Lityagina 2007</xref>). Weak embryo dormancy lasts for 6–7 weeks and is characterized by a slower growth rate of excised embryonic axes. This is probably the effect of preformed abscisic acid (ABA) and can be relieved by fusicoccin, an activator of plasmalemma proton ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C1">Antipova <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C30">Obroucheva and Antipova 2004</xref>).Previous investigations of water status in mature horse chestnut seeds are limited to seeds collected in Colorado, USA. These data reveal 65 % water content and –1.9 MPa water potential in embryonic axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C8">Farrant and Walters 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C45">Walters 2000</xref>) or 60 % water content in embryonic axes and 55 % water content in cotyledons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C10">Farrant <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>). The vacuoles in embryonic axes were found to be almost disappeared by full maturation. In hypocotyls, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C8">Farrant and Walters (1998)</xref> noted an absence of vacuoles and the presence of protein bodies, but the latter lacked membranes and had amorphous content associated with precipitated saponins. Thus, only weak vacuolation was evident in radicle meristems. In contrast, mature freshly shed seeds collected in Kiev (Ukraine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C24">Musatenko <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>) possess large vacuoles in embryonic axes.In seeds from central Russia, water content in embryonic axes is maintained at 63–65 % during the entire stratification period and must increase to 73–74 % for germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C30">Obroucheva and Antipova 2004</xref>). The maintenance of water content in tissues at the same high level for a prolonged period makes horse chestnut seeds ideal for the study of recalcitrance in terms of vacuole preservation. An additional simplifying advantage is that growth initiation in embryonic axes of germinating horse chestnut seeds occurs only by cell elongation, with no contribution by cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C26">Obroucheva 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C29">Obroucheva and Antipova 2003</xref>). The hypogeal germination of horse chestnut seeds begins by elongation of hypocotyl cells, which results in radicle protrusion. Cell elongation in radicle cells commences only after radicle protrusion. The embryonic axis grows by cell elongation up to a length of 3cm. For this reason, the growth initiation in horse chestnut seeds may be considered a model of seed germination as cell elongation is the primary and obligatory germination event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C26">Obroucheva 1999</xref>). The vacuolar status of cells in embryonic axes and further cell vacuolation in elongating cells are of primary importance, because the water entering vacuoles produces additional pressure on cell walls, thus favouring elongation.Vacuolar status in embryonic axes includes the ability to regulate water inflow. To enter a cell and vacuole, water penetrates the membranes by diffusion and by transport through water channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C43">Tyerman <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C14">Javot and Maurel 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C21">Maurel <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). To clarify these possibilities, we identified plasmalemma and tonoplast aquaporins (i.e. water channel proteins) and evaluated their participation in water inflow. The presence of aquaporins and their activity are known to be closely related to cell elongation in growing plant organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C33">Obroucheva and Sin'kevich 2010</xref>). This study establishes the vacuolar status of recalcitrant seeds in terms of vacuole preservation, enlargement and activity in relation to water inflow in embryonic axes. Vacuolar status is shown to be closely related to the maintenance of high water content during a long stratification time and to cell elongation at early germination.Freshly shed horse chestnut (<italic>A. hippocastanum</italic>) seeds were collected from the Main Botanical Garden (Moscow, Russia) in October 2007–2009. They were stratified at 4 °C in wet sand for 4 months to break dormancy. During the course of stratification, seeds were regularly examined for radicle emergence under optimum water supply and temperature (27 °C) in the dark. In this way, we were able to distinguish between deep dormancy, dormancy release and non-dormant state. Initiation of germination, i.e. radicle emergence, was evaluated as the appearance of a 1-mm-long radicle tip. During stratification, excised embryonic axes were fixed for microscopical examination and also stored at –20 °C for later biochemical analysis.Water content was routinely measured in embryonic axes by weighing before and after drying. Vital staining of vacuoles in longitudinal sections of freshly excised embryonic axes was performed with 0.01 % Neutral Red (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C3">Baryckina <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>). Sections 60 µm thick were cut with an HM-650V vibratome and examined under an Axio Imager D1 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberhofen, Germany). For light microscopy, embryonic axes were fixed according to Birch-Girschfeld with a Zenker fixative modified for vacuole preservation. The fixative consisted of 3 g of HgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 g of K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and 1 g of Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> per 100 mL of H<sub>2</sub>O. Just prior to fixation, 5 mL of 10 % aqueous formaldehyde were added. After 24 h fixation, axes were washed in running water and transferred to I<sub>2</sub>+KI solution to remove residual HgCl<sub>2</sub>. The material was then dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Longitudinal sections were stained with Procion Bright Blue RS and Procion Bright Red 2BS dyes according to Ivanov and Litinskaya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C13">Ivanov 1987</xref>). The size and number of cells in radicles and hypocotyls were measured under a light microscope in the third longitudinal rows of the outer cortex.To characterize membrane proteins, microsomal fractions from embryonic axes were used. The axes were first excised from intact seeds during stratification and then either immediately frozen or cultivated to radicle emergence in water in Petri dishes in the dark at 27 °C. Frozen axes weighing 15 g (300 embryonic axes from dormant seeds or 150 protruding axes) were homogenized at 4 °C in extraction buffer comprising 300 mM sucrose, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 5 mM potassium meta-bisulphite, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 5 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 0.6 % polyvinylpyrollidone in the ratio of 1 : 20. The microsomal fraction was sedimented by centrifugation for 1 h at 100 000 <italic>g</italic>, and the pellet resuspended in the same medium. Prior to electrophoresis, microsomal preparations were transferred to two-fold buffer, containing 0.125 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4 % sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), 20 % glycerol, 200 mM DTT and 0.02 % bromophenol blue. Proteins were then separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a Midget Electrophoresis Unit 2050 (LKB, Bromma, Sweden) according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C18">Laemmli (1970)</xref>. Gels were stained with Coomassie R-250. Molecular masses were determined with protein markers (10–225 kDa) from Promega (Madison, WI, USA).For western blot analysis, electrophoretically separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) using a Multiphor Electrophoresis Unit (LKB, Sweden). The membrane was washed three times for 5 min with a buffer containing 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 2.7 mM KCl, 137 mM NaCl, 0.05 % Tween 20 (PBS-T) and blocked with 5 % non-fat dry milk in PBS-T.To identify plasmalemma (PIP) and tonoplast (TIP) aquaporins as well as vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, nitrocellulose membranes were treated with appropriate antibodies. Nitrocellulose blots were treated with anti-PIP1;1, anti-PIP2;2 and anti-TIP2 antibodies kindly provided by Professor C. Maurel (École supérieure agronomique, Montpellier, France). Antibodies against TIP3;1 were produced in our institute, and the antibodies against subunit E of plant vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> were purchased from Antisera (Vannas, Sweden). Protein bands were visualized with secondary antibodies coupled with horseradish peroxidase (Promega).The open or closed state of water channels in the membranes was assessed by a method previously developed for growing roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C2">Barrouclough <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C14">Javot and Maurel 2002</xref>). This involves measuring water absorption, its inhibition by mercuric chloride and subsequent restoration by certain reductants such as DTT. Water uptake by control embryonic axes was measured as an increase in fresh weight. Other embryonic axes were weighed and transferred to 0.5 mM mercuric chloride for 30 min, then weighed again to evaluate the inhibition of water inflow by Hg<sup>2+</sup> ions. The rinsed embryonic axes were then incubated in 10 mM DTT to eliminate the mercury-induced inhibition of water uptake and weighed again.Vacuolar acid invertase activity was measured after protein extraction with 0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, followed by centrifugation and subsequent supernatant dialysis against the same buffer for 24 h. The reaction was carried out in 0.01 M phosphate-citrate buffer, pH 5.5, with the substrates (50 mM sucrose or raffinose) at 30 °C for 40 min. Fructose content was estimated by colour reaction with resorcinol at 520 nm with a Genesys 10uv spectrophotometer (Thermo, Madison, WI, USA). To characterize the molecular properties of acid vacuolar invertase, native electrophoresis in 7 % polyacrylamide gels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C6">Davis 1964</xref>) was used with subsequent invertase identification. Protein separation was carried out for 2.5 h at 20 mA, the gel was washed in 0.01 M phosphate-citrate buffer, pH 5.5, for 10 min at 35 °C in darkness and transferred to fresh buffer containing 0.6 M sucrose for an hour at 37 °C in darkness. The invertase reaction was terminated by boiling in 4 % NaOH containing 0.2 % 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride. The red colour produced by fructose formed indicated the location of invertase protein within the gel.Total protein was estimated with a Sigma BCA protein assay. The colour reaction was measured at 620 nm with a Genesys 10uv spectrophotometer (Thermo) with bovine serum albumin as the standard.<bold>Dormancy release in imbibing horse chestnut seeds subjected to cold wet stratification.</bold> Data represent the germination rate of seeds incubated under optimum conditions after 0, 4, 9, 12 and 16 weeks of stratification.

Radicle tips are instead pushed out by the elongating hypocotyl. Radicles retained a meristematic pattern and contained only small vacuoles at this time (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS008F5">5</xref>B). Radicle protrusion results from cell elongation starting from the upper end of the hypocotyl and gradually spreading downward (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS008F3">3</xref>, curve 2). For radicle protrusion, a doubling of length in the upper part of the hypocotyl operates as the driving force. These cells were 30 µm long on average with the uppermost cells elongating to a shorter size.All cells of the outer cortex along the hypocotyl were found to be vacuolated. Even at the base of the hypocotyl (third millimetre of the embryonic axis), cortical non-elongating cells contain vacuoles, which are greater in size (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS008F5">5</xref>C) than in hypocotyls of non-protruded embryonic axes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS008F5">5</xref>A). No small vacuoles were observed. Vacuoles appear to increase in size by fusion and subsequent dilation. This is in line with previous observations in oat root cells of vacuoles forming by the enlargement and fusion of numerous small vacuoles, and the disappearance of the membranes situated between the fusing adjacent vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C11">Herman <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>).Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS008F3">3</xref> (curve 3) shows the cell length increase in 15-mm-long embryonic axes that were continuing to grow immediately after radicle emergence. The radicle still did not start to extend, and its apical cells remain meristematic, with small vacuoles. However, cortical cells in the upper part of the first millimetre of the radicle are more vacuolated. This process is clearly seen in radicle cells of the second millimetre (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS008F5">5</xref>D). As in the hypocotyl, vacuolation in the radicle precedes the initiation of cell elongation.Vacuolation in hypocotyl cells continued, with increasing cell hydration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS008F2">2</xref>). Cells in the central region elongated more actively than the upper cells while the lowest hypocotyl cells only started to extend. Vacuoles in hypocotyl basal cells (third millimetre of the axis) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS008F5">5</xref>E) were similar to those in the third millimetre of the hypocotyl at the time of radicle emergence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS008F5">5</xref>C). The middle cells (fifth millimetre) possessed numerous large vacuoles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS008F5">5</xref>F) with thin cytoplasmic bands between them. The most elongated cells of such hypocotyls were characterized by large vacuoles of various sizes but no central vacuole had yet formed. These cells were still far below the final size of fully elongated cells (150 µm on average) and their vacuolation remained incomplete.<bold>Identification of plasmalemma aquaporins PIP1 and PIP2 by immunoblotting of microsomal fractions from horse chestnut embryonic axes.</bold> (A and C) Embryonic axes excised from intact seeds during stratification.

It seems reasonable to classify it not just as a marker of protein bodies, but rather as a tonoplast marker in maturing vacuoles, independent of their further transformation or non-transformation to protein bodies.<bold>Identification of vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase by immunoblotting of microsomal fractions isolated from 1-mm segments along embryonic axes from non-dormant horse chestnut seeds.</bold> Data included immunoblots prior to and at radicle emergence, and in apical 10-mm segments of 15- to 20-mm-long growing embryonic axes.

High humidity prevents water loss and desiccation of maturing seeds. These are shed when well hydrated and can immediately germinate in wet litter and soil. Similar seed behaviour is typical of plants in subtropical regions, as the shedding and germination coincide with the warm rainy season. When seed production in 886 tree and shrub species belonging to 93 families was studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C42">Tweedle <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>), the proportion of species producing recalcitrant seeds was found to decrease as the habitat became more arid. Because of a very short interval between shedding and germination, no attention was paid to the specific physiological features of recalcitrant seeds at this time. The present paper addresses this shortcoming by following the fate of vacuoles in embryonic axes of a recalcitrant seed, horse chestnut. This species was chosen because it is capable of preserving recalcitrance and maintaining a high water content for a long period after seed shedding. This specific feature of horse chestnut seeds is an adaptation to the climatic conditions of central Russia. It prevents the rapid seed germination typical of recalcitrant seeds and replaces it with a state of deep dormancy and a slow release following low-temperature stratification. During this long period, seeds remain desiccation sensitive and maintain high hydration levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS008F2">2</xref>). This makes these seeds ideal for studying the physiology of recalcitrance and the role of vacuoles.High hydration of embryonic axes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS008F2">2</xref>) indicates the preservation of vacuoles. This phenomenon, impossible in orthodox seeds, was demonstrated by vital staining of embryonic axes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS008F4">4</xref>) as well as by electron microscopy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS008F5">5</xref>A). The question arises as to whether or not these vacuoles remain physiologically active during the recalcitrant period. The properties of the vacuolar enzyme, acid invertase, showed that this enzyme is able to hydrolyse sucrose and raffinose during the entire recalcitrant period (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS008F11">11</xref>A) and beyond (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS008F11">11</xref>B and C), i.e. it preserved its activity due to retention of molecular mass and subunit composition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS008F12">12</xref>). Therefore, these vacuoles preserve the enzyme machinery ready to operate under conditions favourable for germination.For recalcitrant seeds, water relations appear to be a key aspect of their behaviour. The maintenance of high hydration and vacuoles that operate as osmotic compartments was indicated by the water transport and water channel experiments. In addition to continuous water diffusion through membranes, water channels allow for rapid osmotic-driven water flow not only into cells but also from cell to cell (transcellular water transport) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C43">Tyerman <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C21">Maurel <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). This accelerates water transport. The aquaporins in imbibing and germinating seeds were analysed in orthodox arabidopsis seeds by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C47">Willigen <italic>et al</italic>. (2006)</xref>, but were studied not in embryonic axes but in intact seeds. In horse chestnut we found water channel proteins in the membranes of both plasmalemma and tonoplast (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS008F6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS008F7">7</xref>) during the long recalcitrant period, and showed that they were preserved in embryonic axes up to growth initiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS008F7">7</xref>B and D). In non-dormant horse chestnut seeds, water channels appeared to remain closed at radicle emergence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS008F10">10</xref>C). They take part in water inflow only after radicle emergence, i.e. in actively elongating cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS008F10">10</xref>A and B), their opening presumably being a result of phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C21">Maurel <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). This conclusion corresponds to the observations made on intact arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C47">Willigen <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>) and pea seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C44">Veselova and Veselovsky 2006</xref>). After growth initiation, in elongating cells, water transport occurs not only by diffusion, but through open water channels in the membranes too. Active cell vacuolation is accompanied by the commencement of osmotic-driven accelerated water inflow through the water channels.In horse chestnuts, the vacuoles were not transformed to protein bodies at seed maturation and did not function as reserve protein deposits as often seen in orthodox dicot seeds. Furthermore, no restoration of protein bodies to vacuoles was observed. Vacuoles in horse chestnut axes remained unconverted, and preserved their contents, the enzyme machinery and tonoplast aquaporins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS008F7">7</xref>). Therefore, these vacuoles retain their physiological potential during the recalcitrant period; their functional readiness being realized in the rapid commencement of cell elongation in non-dormant recalcitrant seeds.Being an obligatory pre-germinative event, cell vacuolation in non-dormant imbibing horse chestnut seeds develops rapidly, starting from pre-existing and functionally ready vacuoles. As an active osmotic compartment, these vacuoles take up water and enlarge before cell elongation begins in the hypocotyl and root. This additional amount of water raises the turgor pressure needed to drive cell elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C26">Obroucheva 1999</xref>). Such activity depends directly on the accumulation of osmolytes such as sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C34">Obroucheva <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>) following a rise in invertase activity. For comparison, in orthodox arabidopsis seeds, invertase genes are expressed much later, after radicle emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C22">Mitsuhashi <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). Thereafter, vacuoles are seen to enlarge by fusion and subsequent dilation, and vacuolation follows the pattern typical for growing cells. It should be emphasized that the opening of water channels in embryonic axes after radicle protrusion greatly favours cell vacuolation by facilitating accelerated osmotically driven water inflow.The physiological strategy of mature recalcitrant seeds is not to lose water below a relatively high fatal value and to be able to germinate at once. A key component of this strategy is the maintenance of a constant high water content by minimizing water evaporation through a wax-covered dense seed coat, maintenance of an osmotic potential of approximately −3 MPa generated by sucrose and potassium ions in the embryonic axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C26">Obroucheva 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C27">Obroucheva and Antipova 1999</xref>), and maintaining 63–65 % water content (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS008F2">2</xref>), which that is sufficient for metabolic activity. Metabolism is suppressed during stratification by cold temperatures. After dormancy release, if both temperature and water supply are within a permissible range, cells immediately begin the pre-germinative preparation for growth. It is their advantage over orthodox seeds because germination of recalcitrant seeds is not delayed by the need for imbibition and metabolic activation.The second strategic advantage of recalcitrant seeds is the preservation of intact functionally active vacuoles. In contrast, in orthodox seeds, protein bodies must first be restored to vacuoles. In horse chestnut seeds, vacuolar readiness in embryonic cells enables rapid germination. A further advantage of recalcitrant seeds is an early import of sucrose from cotyledons to the imbibing embryonic axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C34">Obroucheva <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C35">2009</xref>). For example, after 9-week-long stratification, the sucrose content increased in the axes on the fourth day, whereas the radicle first emerged on the tenth day. Sucrose import begins in recalcitrant seeds prior to growth initiation, whereas in orthodox seeds sucrose translocation from the cotyledons commences much later, after growth initiation. Early transport in recalcitrant seeds is possible because of the high hydration level maintained in vascular tissues. Owing to rapid delivery of sucrose and increasing activities of two acid invertases located in cell walls and vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C20">Lityagina 2010</xref>), fructose and glucose, which are of central importance for various metabolic pathways, are accumulated. Increasing activity of vacuolar invertase is mostly the outcome of new enzyme synthesis based on long-lived mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C32">Obroucheva and Lityagina 2009</xref>). The activities of both invertases contribute to a 20 % increase in osmotic pressure in embryonic axes just prior to radicle emergence, thus favouring commencement of cell elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS008C34">Obroucheva <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>).Taken together, these physiological features of recalcitrant seeds explain their readiness for germination and subsequent successful development. Here we have probed some of the physiological features determining the recalcitrant habit. We identified the maintenance of high water content, preservation of potentiated vacuoles, early import of sucrose to the embryonic axis and rapid initiation of cell elongation as the outstanding functional features contributing to the ability of recalcitrant seeds to germinate promptly.We show that cells of embryonic axes in mature recalcitrant horse chestnut seeds are characterized by a prolonged recalcitrant state associated with the maintenance of a high water content and preservation of vacuoles after seed shedding. These vacuoles appear to be physiologically active because membrane proteins, e.g. aquaporins, and activity of invertase enzyme are preserved. These vacuoles are therefore ready to function in imbibing seeds to support rapid onset of the cell elongation that results in germination. Future work to demonstrate the extent of the applicability of our finding to other recalcitrant species will give further insight into a seed survival strategy that contrasts markedly with that of orthodox seeds, in which drying at maturation is essential for survival.We acknowledge financial support from the <grant-sponsor xlink:type="simple">Russian Federation for Basic Research</grant-sponsor> (grants no. <grant-num xlink:type="simple">08-04-004160</grant-num> and <grant-num xlink:type="simple">11-04-01139</grant-num>) and the <grant-sponsor xlink:type="simple">Program for Molecular and Cell Biology of the Presidium of Russian Academy of Sciences</grant-sponsor>.The overall contributions by the authors were similar.None declared.The authors are very grateful to Professor Christophe Maurel for his gift of aquaporin antibodies.
