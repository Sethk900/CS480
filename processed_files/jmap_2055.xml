Mature semiarid chaparral ecosystems can be a significant sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide.Carbon flux in arid and semiarid area shrublands, especially in old-growth shrub ecosystems, has been rarely studied using eddy covariance techniques. In this study, eddy covariance measurements over a 100-year old-growth chamise-dominated chaparral shrub ecosystem were conducted for 7 years from 1996 to 2003. A carbon sink, from -;96 to -;155 g C m<sup>-;2</sup> yr<sup>-;1</sup>, was determined under normal weather conditions, while a weak sink of -;18 g C m<sup>-;2</sup> yr<sup>-;1</sup> and a strong source of 207 g C m<sup>-;2</sup> yr<sup>-;1</sup> were observed as a consequence of a severe drought. The annual sink strength of carbon in the 7-year measurement period was -;52 g C m<sup>-;2</sup> yr<sup>-;1</sup>. The results from our study indicate that, in contrast to previous thought, the old-growth chaparral shrub ecosystem can be a significant sink of carbon under normal weather conditions and, therefore, be an important component of the global carbon budget.
