Natural history of the African riverine tiger beetle Chaetodera regalis (Dejean) (Coleoptera: Cicindelidae)The tiger beetle Chaetodera regalis (Dejean) (Coleoptera: Cicindelidae) is widely distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa. We studied activity patterns, ecological interactions, and behaviour of this species along four major rivers in Kruger National Park, South Africa. During the dry season, small numbers of adult beetles are found on sand bars along perennial rivers. In the rainy season, adults are found in large numbers on a broad spectrum of substrates (including clays, coarse and fine sands and gravels, and black organic soils) and geomorphological features (sand flats, mud flats, sand bars, beaches, riverbanks, and dry and wet sandy streambeds) in riverine areas. Predatory, defensive, thermoregulatory, and reproductive behaviours are described. This species may prove to be a useful indicator of the health of African riverine systems: adults are abundant in high-quality riverine areas; adults and larvae may be adversely affected by human activities; and adults are easily detected, even by novice surveyors.
