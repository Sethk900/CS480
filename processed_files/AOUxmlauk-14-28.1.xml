In order to successfully remove parasitic eggs, robins must first differentiate between their eggs and foreign eggs, and then remove the foreign egg(s). Our primary objectives were to determine (1) whether the robins reject cowbird eggs because they are in the minority (&ldquo;discordancy hypothesis&rdquo;) or because robins have learned the appearance of their own eggs regardless of whether they form the majority of eggs in the nest (&ldquo;true egg recognition hypothesis&rdquo;); and (2) whether the robin's ability to recognize its eggs and reject parasitic eggs was affected by the parasite-to-host egg ratio. We added artificial cowbird eggs to robin nests to create 3 treatments: (1) a majority of robin eggs, (2) an equal number of robin and cowbird eggs, and (3) a majority of cowbird eggs. Parasite-to-host egg ratios were between 1:3 and 3:1. Robins ejected all cowbird eggs at 88&percnt; of nests (51 of 58). The frequency of ejection did not differ between the 3 treatments, indicating that robins typically recognized their eggs regardless of whether they were the majority egg type, providing strong support for the true egg recognition hypothesis. However, the risk of ejection for the artificial cowbird eggs was greater as the ratio of cowbird to host eggs increased, which suggests that robins respond adaptively to the increased fitness costs of multiple parasitism. Finally, the risk of ejection of our artificial cowbird eggs was greater later in the nesting season. Because many individuals were exposed to their eggs for the first time early in the season, this result suggests that robins learn to recognize their eggs during their initial nesting attempt.<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Turdus migratorius</named-content></italic> t&iacute;picamente expulsa huevos par&aacute;sitos de <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Molothrus ater</named-content></italic> de sus nidos.

Brood parasitism typically reduces host fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Lorenzana1">Lorenzana and Sealy 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Hauber1">Hauber 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Peer1">Peer et al. 2013</xref>), and many host species have evolved specialized defenses to minimize the costs of parasitism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Rothstein7">Rothstein 1990</xref>). One of the most efficacious host defenses is the rejection of cowbird eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Rothstein2">Rothstein 1975a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Peer5">Peer and Sealy 2004</xref>). However, species that reject brood-parasite eggs must distinguish the foreign egg from their own and may do so by means of 3 mechanisms, the first 2 of which are cognitive mechanisms. The first of these mechanisms is rejection via discordancy. These hosts do not recognize their eggs or the parasite egg per se, but simply reject the egg type that is in the minority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Rensch1">Rensch 1925</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Rothstein1">Rothstein 1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Rothstein3">1975b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Moskat1">Mosk&aacute;t et al. 2010</xref>). The disadvantage of using this mechanism to reject foreign eggs is that when a host is multiply parasitized, its own eggs may be discordant and will be ejected from the nest.The second mechanism is called &ldquo;true egg recognition,&rdquo; whereby hosts rely on a mental template that enables them to learn the appearance of their own eggs and reject eggs that are sufficiently different, regardless of whether they are the majority egg type in the nest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Rothstein1">Rothstein 1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Rothstein5">1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Peer4">Peer and Sealy 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Hauber2">Hauber et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Strausberger1">Strausberger and Rothstein 2009</xref>). The amount of time required for a host to learn the appearance of its eggs may vary, depending on the degree of intraclutch variation it demonstrates, and this variation may also increase the host's tolerance of foreign eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Lotem2">Lotem et al. 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Peer3">Peer et al. 2010</xref>). Occasionally, hosts misimprint on parasite eggs that are laid early in the nest cycle and reject their own eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Rothstein1">Rothstein 1974</xref>). This may be a strategy employed by cowbirds to exploit this learning mechanism and to increase the chances that their eggs will be accepted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Strausberger1">Strausberger and Rothstein 2009</xref>).A third mechanism for egg recognition is minimization of intraclutch egg variation. Hosts that have been subjected to brood parasitism should evolve clutches with minimal intraclutch variation in appearance, facilitating recognition of the parasitic egg (Davies and Brooke 1989, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Stokke1">Stokke et al. 1999</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Cherry1">Cherry et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Abernathy1">Abernathy and Peer 2014</xref>). Multiple parasitism with nonmimetic eggs should also lead to increased rejection of foreign eggs because of the increased intraclutch variation this creates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Moskat2">Mosk&aacute;t et al. 2009</xref>).Only 10&percnt; of North American hosts reject cowbird eggs, and among these rejecters is the American Robin (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Turdus migratorius</named-content></italic>; hereafter &ldquo;robin&rdquo;), which rejects close to 100&percnt; of cowbird eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Peer5">Peer and Sealy 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Peer2">Peer and Rothstein 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Croston2">Croston and Hauber 2014b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Kuehn1">Kuehn et al. 2014</xref>). Robins typically eject cowbird eggs by grasping them with their bills, but they also occasionally peck them despite the risk of damage to their own eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Rasmussen1">Rasmussen et al. 2009</xref>). To eject a parasitic egg from its nest, a robin must first recognize which egg(s) should be ejected. Robin eggs are immaculate blue and are larger than cowbird eggs (see below), whereas cowbird eggs have a white background with brown and gray spots. Although robin and cowbird eggs are readily discernible to humans, robin eggs appear more similar to cowbird eggs when viewed from the perspective of the avian eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Croston3">Croston and Hauber 2014c</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Rothstein6">Rothstein (1982)</xref> suggested that robins distinguish their own eggs from cowbird eggs by focusing on the 3 parameters of size, background color, and spotting pattern, in addition to shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Underwood1">Underwood and Sealy 2006</xref>), but reject eggs only if they differ from robin eggs in at least 2 of these parameters. In this manner, they avoid rejecting their own odd eggs that may differ in one of these characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Rothstein6">Rothstein 1982</xref>).In the present study, we first examined the egg recognition behavior of robins by subjecting them to 3 treatments in which the clutches contained either a majority of robin eggs, a majority of cowbird eggs, or equal numbers of both. The true egg recognition, discordancy, and clutch uniformity hypotheses generate different predictions when hosts are confronted with single versus multiple parasite eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Moskat2">Mosk&aacute;t et al. 2009</xref>). If robins display true egg recognition, they should eject all cowbird eggs placed in their nest, regardless of which egg type is in the majority. On the other hand, if rejection is based on discordancy, robins should simply eject the minority egg type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Rothstein5">Rothstein 1978</xref>). Rejection based on clutch uniformity is not likely to be the mechanism used by robins, because, like most members of the family Turdidae, they lay immaculate blue eggs with minimal intraclutch variation. If minimal intraclutch variation evolved in response to cowbird parasitism, rejection should be a trait common to the majority of the Turdidae, yet relatively few thrushes reject foreign eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Peer5">Peer and Sealy 2004</xref>).Second, we examined the effect of the ratio of cowbird to robin eggs on the ejection behavior of robins. Higher numbers of cowbird eggs in robin nests are likely to decrease their fitness. Thus, robins should be more likely to eject cowbird eggs from nests (or eject them more rapidly) with higher parasite-to-host egg ratios.Finally, we examined the development of egg recognition by robins over the course of the breeding season. The earliest-breeding individuals may have nested in a previous season, are familiar with their egg appearance and variation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Peer3">Peer et al. 2010</xref>), and should be more likely to reject foreign eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Lotem1">Lotem et al. 1992</xref>). Alternatively, later-nesting birds may have nested earlier in the current season and remember their eggs from the previous clutch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Petrie1">Petrie et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Strausberger1">Strausberger and Rothstein 2009</xref>). We predicted that experienced birds would always express rejection behavior, but that naive birds tending their first nest would be less likely to reject cowbird eggs from their nest, or may require more time to reject. If there is a difference in the expression of egg rejection between naive and experienced birds, there should be a seasonal increase in rejection reflecting the higher proportion of naive birds nesting at the beginning of the season.Artificial eggs mimicking those of cowbirds and robins were formed from modeling clay (Sculpey Original; Polyform, Elk Grove Village, Illinois, USA) and baked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Bayne1">Bayne and Hobson 1999</xref>). Artificial cowbird eggs averaged 22.2 &plusmn; 0.3 &times; 16.9 &plusmn; 0.5 mm (subsample <italic>n</italic> &equals; 20; all measurements are presented as means &plusmn; SD); real cowbird eggs average 21.5 &times; 16.2 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Bent2">Bent 1958</xref>). Artificial robin eggs averaged 29.5 &plusmn; 0.5 &times; 21.7 &plusmn; 0.7 mm (subsample <italic>n</italic> &equals; 7); real ones measure 28.1 &times; 20.0 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Bent1">Bent 1949</xref>). Eggs were painted with acrylic all-purpose water-based paint (DecoArt, Stanford, Kentucky, USA) and sprayed with a clear acrylic gloss (Krylon Indoor/Outdoor; Sherwin-Williams, Cleveland, Ohio, USA). This acrylic paint and gloss increased the detectability of pecks inflicted by the robins.Nests were found throughout Charleston and Mattoon, Illinois (Coles County), USA, during May and June of 2010 (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 44) and April of 2011 (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 27). Areas were visited only once per year to avoid testing the same birds again. Also, because robins tend to return to the same nesting location each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Young1">Young 1955</xref>), different locations within the study area were used in each year. Every nest was assigned a Julian date, when an experiment was initiated. This allowed us to combine both years of data to assess the development of rejection behavior in first-time nesters. Correctly differentiating yearling from adult American Robins is difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Howell1">Howell 1942</xref>), and we did not capture adults. Therefore, the number of days into the nesting season was used as an alternative method of assessing the experience level of birds.The first nest found at the start of the study was randomly assigned a treatment of &ldquo;majority robin,&rdquo; &ldquo;equal,&rdquo; or &ldquo;majority cowbird.&rdquo; After manipulations, majority robin nests had more robin eggs than cowbird eggs, nests in the equal treatment group had an equal number of cowbird and robin eggs, and majority cowbird nests had more cowbird than robin eggs. All subsequent nests were assigned a treatment sequentially. To allow robins the opportunity to learn to recognize their own eggs, only nests that contained at least 2 eggs were used in our manipulations. Manipulations were conducted during the laying and incubation stages of the nest cycle; therefore, individuals whose nests were manipulated during incubation may have had more time to learn the appearance of their eggs than those whose nests were manipulated during the laying stage.When manipulating clutches, the assigned treatment and number of eggs found in the nest determined the exact manipulation. To mimic natural parasitism as closely as possible, the total number of eggs in the nest was never increased by more than 1. Because the number of eggs initially found in a nest was variable, the number of robin eggs removed and the number of cowbird eggs added varied accordingly; more than 1 robin egg was removed in some cases to achieve the desired ratio. For example, if a nest assigned a &ldquo;majority cowbird&rdquo; treatment was found with 3 robin eggs, 3 cowbird eggs would replace 2 of the robin eggs. After manipulation, the total number of eggs would have been increased from 3 to 4, and the resulting ratio would be 3 cowbird eggs to 1 robin egg. If that same nest was given the &ldquo;equal&rdquo; treatment, 1 robin egg would be removed and 2 cowbird eggs would be added, resulting in 2 robin and 2 cowbird eggs after manipulation. This protocol created parasite-to-host egg ratios that varied from 1:3 to 3:1. As a control, single robin eggs were replaced with artificial robin eggs in 8 nests. After manipulation, nests were checked at ~24-hr intervals for 5 days. Nests that contained cowbird eggs on the fifth day were considered to have accepted the parasitism, and those from which the cowbird egg had been removed were considered rejections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Rothstein2">Rothstein 1975a</xref>). Desertions were not considered rejections because nests are deserted for numerous reasons and it is often difficult to ascertain the proximate cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Rothstein2">Rothstein 1975a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Hill1">Hill and Sealy 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Peer2">Peer and Rothstein 2010</xref>). Robins typically eject foreign eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Croston2">Croston and Hauber 2014b</xref>), but low levels of desertion have been reported in experimentally parasitized nests, and it is unclear whether these are responses to parasitism or to some other disturbance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Rothstein2">Rothstein 1975a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Kuehn1">Kuehn et al. 2014</xref>).A motion-detecting color video camera (Sony Super HAD, 580-line color bullet camera, 3.6-mm lens) was used to observe the initial response to cowbird parasitism at 2 robin nests in 2011. One artificial cowbird egg was added to each nest, and the camera was attached to a nearby branch or trunk ~30 cm above the nest. The camera was left to record for ~5 hr.We conducted 2 separate survival analyses using either treatment egg ratio or Julian day as the independent variable. In this context, survival analyses combine the likelihood that an ejection occurred and the latency to that ejection, together represented by a hazard ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Bayne1">Bayne and Hobson 1999</xref>). The hazard ratio is an estimate of the risk of ejection in response to a predictor variable. This risk estimate will hereafter be referred to as &ldquo;risk of ejection.&rdquo;Robins exhibited 1 of 4 responses to the eggs placed in their nest: (1) All parasitic eggs were removed, (2) all parasitic eggs were pecked but not removed, (3) some parasitic eggs were pecked but not removed, or (4) no eggs were pecked or removed. These 4 responses were placed into 3 categories: full ejections (no. 1 above), partial ejections (nos. 2 and 3), and acceptance (no. 4). Robins that removed cowbird eggs from their nests were termed &ldquo;full ejections.&rdquo; Alternatively, if eggs were not removed but peck marks were observed, the nest was categorized as a partial ejection. Although both partial and full ejections were included in the survival analysis, only the nests that fully ejected cowbird eggs were analyzed using a Kruskal-Wallis analysis to assess the effect of treatment ratio (number of cowbird eggs per robin egg), overall treatment (majority cowbird, equal, or majority robin), and the number of eggs present at the start of the manipulation on the number of days to ejection. The number of days to ejection was used to assess the ability of robins to recognize foreign eggs and the ability to remove foreign eggs from their nest. This was based on the assumption that the latency to eject is correlated with the birds' ability to recognize and remove foreign eggs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Antonov1">Antonov et al. 2008</xref>). If ratio affects this ability, there will be varying response times, influenced by differential ability to recognize and eject cowbird eggs.A total of 71 robin nests were tested, 58 of which were included in the analyses. Thirteen nests were excluded because of depredation (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 3), desertion (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 4; <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-t01">Table 1</xref>), or hatching of robin eggs within the 5-day observation period (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 6). No nests were naturally parasitized. Cowbird eggs were fully ejected at 88&percnt; of our nests, and the likelihood of ejection did not differ among our 3 treatments (majority robin, equal, or majority cowbird; Fisher's exact test, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.67; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-f01">Figure 1</xref>A). In 5 of the 7 nests from which cowbird eggs were not fully ejected, peck marks were observed on at least 1 cowbird egg in the nest (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-t02">Table 2</xref>). However, 2 nests subjected to the equal treatment did not show any damage to the cowbird eggs by the fifth day. The 5 nests that showed evidence of pecking were in either the &ldquo;majority robin&rdquo; or &ldquo;majority cowbird&rdquo; treatments.Description of events when American Robin nests were deserted following egg manipulations.(<bold>A</bold>) Likelihood of complete ejection of all artificial cowbird eggs by American Robins for the 3 treatments and (<bold>B</bold>) latency to ejection for all nests with complete ejection of all cowbird eggs for the 3 treatments (&plus; SE); &ldquo;majority robin&rdquo; signifies nests that had more host eggs than parasite eggs, &ldquo;equal&rdquo; signifies nests that had equal numbers of host and parasite eggs, and &ldquo;majority cowbird&rdquo; signifies nests that had more parasite eggs than host eggs.

Nests were checked at 1-day intervals.Description of events at American Robin nests from which cowbird eggs were partially ejected (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 5) and nests where the cowbird eggs were accepted (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 2).Across all treatments, 67&percnt; of ejections occurred within the first 24 hr of manipulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-f02">Figure 2</xref>). For nests that fully ejected all cowbird eggs, there was no difference in the days to ejection, either among treatment groups (&chi;<sup>2</sup> &equals; 3.87, df &equals; 2, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.14; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-f01">Figure 1</xref>B) or among parasite-to-host egg ratios (&chi;<sup>2</sup> &equals; 4.87, df &equals; 6, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.56; <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-t03">Table 3</xref>). The number of robin eggs present in the nest at the time of manipulation also had no effect on the latency to ejection (&chi;<sup>2</sup> &equals; 4.31, df &equals; 2, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.12). However, when the likelihood of ejection occurring and the latency to ejection were combined as the risk incurred by a cowbird egg using a survival analysis, this risk increased as the nesting season progressed (using the Julian day of manipulation; &chi;<sup>2</sup> &equals; 4.96, df &equals; 1, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.03), where birds tending nests later in the season were more likely to eject and to eject faster. Also, risk increased with the cowbird-to-robin egg ratio in the nest (&chi;<sup>2</sup> &equals; 6.21, df &equals; 1, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.01), indicating that ejection risk was greater for nests with higher proportions of cowbird eggs.Latency to ejection of artificial cowbird eggs placed in American Robin nests (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 51) in which all parasitic eggs were ejected.Summary of American Robins' latency to eject artificial cowbird eggs by parasite-to-host egg ratio and treatment group.Two nests contained damaged robin eggs after the artificial cowbird eggs were ejected. One nest had a parasite-to-host egg ratio of 1:3 and had 2 robin eggs damaged, and the second had a ratio of 1:2 and had 1 robin egg damaged. One of the deserted nests also had a host egg damaged (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-t01">Table 1</xref>).Video recordings of 2 nests showed variation in response to the cowbird egg. At the first nest (May 12, 2011), an adult robin returned within 2 min 30 s of the manipulation and immediately began pecking at the artificial egg. This continued for 45 s, at which time the robin flew away and then returned in 6 s to grasp the egg in its bill and fly away with it. The second nest was tested and recorded in the same manner ~24 hr later. At this nest, an adult returned to the nest in 3 min and began pecking at the cowbird egg less vigorously. Instead of removing it, the bird pecked several times and then began incubating the eggs. This process happened 6 times throughout the recording period and every time the bird returned to the nest. At one point, both adults perched on the edge of the nest and pecked alternately, and 1 opened its bill in an apparent attempt to grasp the egg. Ultimately, however, they did not remove the artificial cowbird egg but continued with incubation. The cowbird egg was still in the nest after ~5 hr when the video camera was removed. Finally, all 8 artificial robin eggs remained in the control nests, with no evidence of pecking for 5 days.Our results support the true egg recognition hypothesis that robins recognize their eggs and reject those that are sufficiently different, regardless of whether their eggs are in the minority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Rothstein3">Rothstein 1975b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Rothstein4">1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Peer4">Peer and Sealy 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Ban1">B&aacute;n et al. 2013</xref>). Robins ejected or pecked at least 1 of the cowbird eggs in all but 2 nests (96&percnt;), and the likelihood of rejection of cowbird eggs was not lower in the majority cowbird egg treatment, as predicted by the discordancy hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Moskat2">Mosk&aacute;t et al. 2009</xref>). This is also evidence against the clutch uniformity hypothesis, which predicts the highest rejection frequencies in nests with equal numbers of host and parasitic eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Moskat2">Mosk&aacute;t et al. 2009</xref>).Evidence of egg recognition was also apparent at the 2 nests that were video recorded. One adult ejected a cowbird egg at the first nest, whereas the other pair pecked at the cowbird egg repeatedly, indicating recognition of the cowbird egg as foreign. The bird at the first nest pecked the artificial cowbird egg prior to grasp-ejecting it, and this may be a form of exploratory pecking whereby birds inspect the foreign egg. The lack of pecking on some, but not all, artificial cowbird eggs at 4 nests might also be due to the artificiality of the eggs. If pecking at the first egg did not result in it breaking, the robin may have been discouraged from attempting to destroy the other artificial parasitic eggs. Alternatively, all but 1 of these nests was multiply parasitized, and these could have been young birds not completely familiar with their egg appearance. Indeed, all of the nests with partial ejections were from early in the season in April.Although recognition was exhibited by most birds, not all birds that recognized their eggs ejected cowbird eggs (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Antonov2">Antonov et al. 2009</xref>). In the video of the second nest, both adult robins pecked the cowbird egg but did not remove it from their nests. This suggests that ejection behavior may develop progressively beyond the initial recognition of foreign eggs. It is also possible that some robins are puncture-ejectors and others may be grasp-ejecters similar to rejecters including the Gray Catbird (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Dumetella carolinensis</named-content></italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Rasmussen1">Rasmussen et al. 2009</xref>). Lastly, robin eggs were damaged in 2 nests from which cowbird eggs were rejected, and also in 1 nest that was deserted. Thus, it is possible that robins occasionally damage their eggs during the rejection attempts (i.e. rejection errors).Our results are the first to show an increased risk of rejection by a cowbird host as the ratio of cowbird to host eggs increased. This adaptive response is expected because more cowbird eggs will lead to a greater reduction in host fitness, even in a large host like the robin (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Croston1">Croston and Hauber 2014a</xref>). This result is in contrast to a similar study on the Red-winged Blackbird (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Agelaius phoeniceus</named-content></italic>), an accepter species. Red-winged Blackbirds showed no adaptive modulation of response to multiple parasitism, which is likely explained by an evolutionary lag in this host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Ward1">Ward et al. 1996</xref>). In addition, our results differ from those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Ban1">B&aacute;n et al. (2013)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Moskat3">Mosk&aacute;t et al. (2014)</xref>, who found that egg ejection by Great Reed Warblers (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Acrocephalus arundinaceus</named-content></italic>) was more likely when their clutches were parasitized by a single foreign egg, compared with parasitism by multiple eggs.Our results are also the first to demonstrate that a cowbird host is more likely to reject eggs later in the nesting season, which suggests that first-time nesters imprint and learn the appearance of their eggs during their initial breeding attempt. Although older birds often breed earliest in a season (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Klomp1">Klomp 1970</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Lotem1">Lotem et al. 1992</xref>), we also expected the highest proportion of first-time nesters during this period. These first-time nesters may not have fully developed ejection behavior and are less likely to eject cowbird eggs (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Lotem1">Lotem et al. 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Lotem2">1995</xref>). Later in the breeding season, birds nesting for the first time at the beginning of the breeding season were now nesting for a second or third time, as robins typically do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Sallabanks1">Sallabanks and James 1999</xref>). With increased nesting experience, ejection rates would be expected to increase over the nesting season. Accordingly, we recorded only complete ejections of all parasitic eggs later in the season, presumably after birds had fully learned to recognize their own eggs and developed the ability to eject foreign eggs.Although imprinting may begin on the first egg, hosts may require a longer period or additional eggs to fully learn the range of variation in their eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Peer3">Peer et al. 2010</xref>). A developmental period might exist during the first nesting attempt whereby naive birds imprint on their own eggs and develop ejection behavior, and young birds might not fully express ejection behavior if parasitized during this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Strausberger1">Strausberger and Rothstein 2009</xref>). This is similar to the finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Lotem2">Lotem et al. (1995)</xref> that cuckoo hosts were more likely to accept parasitism in first clutches than in second clutches in the same nesting season. It also seems noteworthy that all of our &ldquo;partial rejections&rdquo; (like our 2 acceptances) were also relatively early in the nesting season. Alternatively, it is possible that birds reacquaint themselves with the appearance of their eggs anew in each breeding season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Soler1">Soler et al. 2013</xref>), which could also explain the seasonal effect. Finally, because we found robin nests only early in the nesting season in 2011, our result may be due to yearly variation in rejection frequency independent of nesting experience, although we consider this explanation is unlikely.Of the 3 possible mechanisms that hosts use when rejecting foreign eggs, our study supports the true egg recognition hypothesis for robins (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-694-Rothstein3">Rothstein 1975b</xref>). Robins were also more responsive to cowbird eggs as the ratio of parasite to host eggs increased, which is indicative of an adaptive response to the increased cost to robin fitness. Egg rejection was not always an immediate response to foreign eggs in our study, but it may require a developmental period during the first nesting attempt to be fully expressed. A large majority of robins tested recognized the foreign eggs in their nest, but not all had developed the grasp-ejection behavior normally exhibited by this species.We thank S. J. Mullin, B.
