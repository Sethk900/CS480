Urbanization results in habitat loss and habitat fragmentation concurrently, both influencing biodiversity and ecological processes. To evaluate these impacts, it is important to understand the relationships between habitat loss and habitat fragmentation per se (HLHF) during urbanization. The objectives of this study were two-fold: 1) to quantify the different forms of the HLHF relationship during urbanization using multiple landscape metrics, and 2) to test the validity of the HLHF relations reported in the literature. Our analysis was based on a long-term urbanization dataset (1800â€“2000) of 16 large cities from around the world. Habitat area was represented as the percentage of non-built-up area in the landscape, while habitat fragmentation was measured using several landscape metrics. Our results show that the relationship between habitat loss and habitat fragmentation during urbanization is commonly monotonicâ€”linear, exponential, or logarithmic, indicating that the degree of habitat fragmentation per se increases with habitat loss in general. We compared our results with 14 hypothesized HLHF relationships based on simulated landscapes found in the literature, and found that four of them were consistent with those of urbanization, whereas the other ten were not. Also, we identified six new HLHF relationships when fragmentation was measured by total core area, normalized total core area, patch density, edge density and landscape shape index, respectively. In addition, our study demonstrated that the â€œspace-for-timeâ€ approach, frequently used in ecology and geography, generated specious HLHF relationships, suggesting that this approach is largely inappropriate for analyses of urban landscapes that are highly heterogeneous in space and unusually contingent in dynamics. Our results show both generalities and idiosyncrasies of the HLHF relationship, providing new insights for assessing ecological effects of urbanization.  Our method for evaluating the relationships between habitat loss and habitat fragmentation per se during urbanization included three steps: 1) extracting habitats; 2) quantifying habitat fragmentation per se; 3) analyzing relationships between habitat loss and habitat fragmentation per se.  *** x represents the percentage of habitat, y represents the value of landscape metric measuring habitat fragmentation.  ** x represents the percentage of habitat, y represents the value of landscape metric measuring habitat fragmentation.  In our research, we selected 10 landscape metrics to quantify habitat fragmentation from the literature on HLHF relationship to facilitate comparison. Specifically, three area metrics (mean patch size, total core area and normalized total core area), two density metrics (patch density and edge density), two shape metrics (landscape shape index and fractal dimension), and three connectivity metrics (nearest neighbor distance, normalized nearest neighbor distance and cohesion) were used.  *The habitats in the historical analysis were derived from data at the central city area extent in Paris in 1800, 1880, 1928, 1955, and 1987. The habitats in the space-for-time analysis were derived from data in Paris in 2000 with the extent of 64 by 64 pixels.  Several conclusions can be drawn from our analysis based on long-term urbanization data. First, urbanization tends to decrease habitat amount and increase habitat fragmentation simultaneously over time. Specifically, as habitat loss continues, mean patch size, total core area, and cohesion of habitats decrease, while patch density, edge density, as well as shape complexity, all increase. This general trend holds despite the diversity of landscape metrics that are used to quantify habitat fragmentation. Second, our results indicate that, as the most intense and designed form of land use, urbanization differs in details from the simulated process of landscape modification in terms of how it influences the relationship between habitat area and fragmentation, e.g., the monotonic relationship between habitat area and shape complexity of habitat. Third, our study demonstrates that the space-for-time approach is unwarranted in evaluating the habitat loss-fragmentation relationship in urban landscapes because of their spatial heterogeneity and temporal contingency. Fourth, our results are helpful for minimizing habitat fragmentation during urbanization through explicitly optimizing the density and shape complexity of habitat in urban landscapes.
