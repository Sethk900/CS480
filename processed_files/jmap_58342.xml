Shortcomings of the RBF Pilot Site in Dishna, EgyptAbstractThis work describes the reasons and circumstances concerning why researchers came up short at the Dishna riverbank filtration (RBF) pilot site in Egypt, which—1.5 years after construction—has yet to deliver at least 40% of the bank filtrate. Limited site investigation, intermittent well operation, low pumping rates, and Egyptian drinking water well design regulations have been identified as main reasons for less than 10% bank filtrate. The authors draw on experience and lessons learned to develop recommendations for RBF site investigations and implementation on a limited budget. The investigations require a minimum investment of 20,000 Egyptian pounds and at least 1.5 years’ time per site. A generalized RBF well design is proposed for sites with scarce data or areas where groundwater is of low quality and unsuitable for potable supply.
