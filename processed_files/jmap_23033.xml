Revision of the genus Dercetina from Taiwan and their similar species, with description of a new species from Myanmar (Insecta, Chrysomelidae, Galerucinae)Abstract Species of the genus Dercetina Gressitt & Kimoto, 1963 in Taiwan are revised. Dercetina azumai Gressitt and Kimoto, 1966, Dercetina itoi Kimoto, 1969, and Dercetina shirozui Kimoto, 1969 are redescribed. Dercetina chinensis (Weise, 1889), Dercetina taiwana (Ch没j么, 1938), and Dercetina unifasciata (Allard, 1889) are removed from synonymy with Dercetina flavocincta (Hope, 1831). Dercetina flavocincta and Dercetina nakanei Kimoto, 1969 are transferred to the genus Arthrotus Motschulsky, 1858. Lectotypes are designated for Dercetis taiwana Ch没j么, 1938, and Antipha varipennis Jacoby, 1890. The synonymies of Antipha flavofasciata Baly, 1879 and Dercetes femoralis Weise, 1922 with Arthrotus flavocincta (Hope, 1831), Antipha varipennis Jacoby, 1890 with Dercetina chinensis (Weise, 1889) are supported. A new species, Dercetina barclayi sp. n. which was confused with Dercetina flavocincta, is described from Myanmar.
