Zur Parasitologie und postparasitischen Entwicklung der neotropischen Wassermilbe Arrenurus valencius (Hydrachnellae, Acari), nebst einigen faunistischen Angaben zum See â€œLaguna Chichojâ€; in GuatemalaAbstract During two visits to Guatemala in 1974 and 1975 observations were made on the fauna in Eichhomia growth of the small lake â€œLaguna Chichojâ€;. Chemical and physical data and faunistic finds are reported. Particular attention was paid to the water mite Arrenurus (Arrenurus) valencius MARSHALL, 1919. Adults of this species occur commonly in the Eichhornia growth. The larvae parasitize adult Ischnura ramburi crÃ©dula (Zygoptera, Odonata). This fits the known pattern according to which nearly all species of the subgenus Arrenurus are parasites of dragonflies belonging to both the Zygoptera as well as Anisoptera (MÃ¼nchberg 1935, Mitchell 1959, BÃ¶ttger 1965, Cassagneâ€MÃ©jean 1966, Cook 1974, Stechmann 1977). Also the first mentions in the literature on tropical species of the subgenus Arrenurus pointed to Odonata as specific hosts (MÃ¼nchberg 1958, 1959, 1960). Ischnura ramburi credula is quite abundant in Eichhornia growth. Both sexes are infested by water mites, the males carrying a maximum of 111, the females of 66 parasites. The average were 24 parasites per male and 16 per female. For both sexes the extensity of infestation was an equal 90%. The parasites are located predominantly at the ventral side of the thorax and the first abdominal segments. During the parasitic phase the volume of the larvae increases considerably: body length and width double. Separation from the host â€ notwithstanding a few exceptions â€ does not take place when after a few days of parasitic existence the amount of food necessary for further development has been ingested but only at the moment of death of the host. This raises the chances of the parasites of returning to the water: the host dragonflies live near the shore and regularly dying individuals fall on the surface of the water or among the Eichhornia plants. Larvae which had left their dead host in the laboratory have been reared through the Postlarval Resting Stage I, the deutonymph stage and the Postlarval Resting Stage II up to the adult. The deutonymphs are carnivorous like the adults; they prey on ostracods with predilection.
