 A review of the Theronia genus-group (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae: Pimplinae) from Vietnam with descriptions of five new speciesThe Vietnamese fauna of the Theronia genus-group of the ichneumonid tribe Pimplini is reviewed for the first time. Five genera are found in the country: Augerella, Epitheronia, Nomosphecia, Parema and Theronia. Epitheronia and Nomosphecia are recorded for the first time from Vietnam. Five species are described as new: Epitheronia vinhanensis sp. nov., Nomosphecia carinicurvata sp. nov., Theronia ferruginaterga sp. nov., T. longihastata sp. nov., and T. tahuythinhi sp. nov. Four species are newly recorded from the country: Nomosphecia scutellata (Gupta), N. zebroides (Krieger), Theronia clathrata Krieger and T. maskeliyae Cameron. Theronia (Augerella) orientalis Gupta is synonymized under Augerella brevicauda (Cushman) (syn. nov.) which is transferred from Nomosphecia (comb. nov.); Theronia (Nomosphecia) zebroides indicus (Gupta) is synonymized under the nominate subspecies, Nomosphecia zebroides (Krieger) (syn. nov.). A key to Vietnamese species of the Theronia genus-group is compiled. http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:997CCF09-255C-4001-932B-A7FCECD8759D
