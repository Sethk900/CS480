Detecting Groundwater Levels Using the Shallow Seismic Method: Case StudyAbstractA shallow seismic method was used in the northwestern part of the Jabal Hafit area, United Arab Emirates (UAE), to delineate the groundwater levels and test the consistency and effectiveness of the seismic refraction technique in detecting groundwater levels. The objectives were achieved through 25 seismic profiles and three electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) sections carried out in the study area. The results were compared with observed groundwater levels. The seismic data analysis indicated that the deepest and shallowest groundwater levels are 15 and 2.5Â m, respectively. These results are consistent with the field measurements of the groundwater levels. The maximum value indicates the prevailing groundwater level within the study area, whereas the minimum detected values may refer to the perched subsurface water that may have been infiltrated from the surrounding water bodies, including irrigation water. The applicability of the shallow seismic method for groundwater level detection was confirmed. Periodical monitoring of the groundwater levels in the study area is recommended.
