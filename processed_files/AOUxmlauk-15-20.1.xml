 Erratum: First global census of the Ad&eacute;lie Penguin  First global census of the Ad&eacute;lie Penguin  In Figure 1 of our article ( Lynch and LaRue 2014 ), we accidentally misidentified the island on the right-hand side (panel B) as Devil Island. The island should have been identified as Paulet Island.  En la Figura 1 de nuestro art&iacute;culo (Lynch y LaRue 2014), accidentalmente identificamos err&oacute;neamente la isla del lado derecho (Panel B) como Isla Diablo. La isla debi&oacute; haber sido identificada como Isla Paulet.   Palabras clave:  Ant&aacute;rtida, Isla Diablo, Isla Paulet, Ping&uuml;ino de Adelia  In Figure 1 of our article ( Lynch and LaRue 2014 ), we accidentally misidentified the island on the right-hand side (panel B) as Devil Island. The island should have been identified as Paulet Island. The corrected caption should read   FIGURE 1.  Map of extant Ad&eacute;lie Penguin colonies, as well as colonies not found in imagery and presumed extinct. Solid (or dashed) bars represent sections of coastline in which populations are generally increasing (or decreasing) in abundance. Areas with no bar are either a mix of increasing and decreasing populations, are not changing in abundance, or do not have sufficient data to assess population change (see Appendix A). Right: Example of high-resolution imagery from Paulet Island (&minus;63.5801&deg;, &minus;55.7881&deg;; location indicated by black arrow). Areas identified in the analysis as guano are shaded in light green.  Note that, given the proximity of Devil Island and Paulet Island in relation to the scale of the map in Figure 1, the location of the arrow in the map is still correct.
