An analysis of yield components of Lupinus albus L.Lupinus albus or sweet white lupin is a crop producing its seed yield in succeeding orders of racemes on the plant. All combinations of 18 yield components of five cultivars grown in 11 environments were correlated with each other. An ideotype for the South African summer rainfall area was drawn up by linking characteristics with highly significant correlations in each array of combinations. Characters positively correlated with single plant seed yield were seed yield/ha, racemes/plant, pods/plant, seeds/plant and seeds/pod. Single seed mass of higher order pods was also positively correlated with seed yield/ha, but not with any other group of characters. For the most important links, the slopes of the regression lines between the characters concerned are shown in the ideogram. Single plant seed yield was negatively correlated with the relative contributions (pods, seeds, seed yield) of the first order. It was consequently concluded that when selecting for higher seed yield/ha in plant types conforming to the ideotype described, the value of this order should not be over-emphasized.
