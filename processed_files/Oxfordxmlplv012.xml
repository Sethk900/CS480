Pollen development is especially vulnerable to chilling but carpels were also affected at the end of their maturation. By associating flower developmental stages to specific bud sizes, it was possible to identify when critical processes are taking place during flower development. These results can be used to shed light on susceptibility to low temperatures of other fruiting crops belonging to the <italic>Rosaceae</italic>.Environmental factors affecting flower development may limit the yields of fruiting crops worldwide. In temperate regions, chilling temperatures during flower development can compromise fruit production, but their negative effects vary depending on the differing susceptibilities of each developmental stage. The cultivated strawberry (<italic>Fragaria</italic>Ã— <italic>ananassa</italic> Duch.) is widely grown worldwide but financial returns are influenced by sudden shifts to chilling temperatures occurring during the cropping cycle. Despite this important limitation, knowledge of <italic>F.</italic>Ã— <italic>ananassa</italic> flower development is lacking, in contrast to the diploid wild-type strawberry (<italic>F. vesca</italic>). In this study we describe steps in floral development of cultivated strawberry and define their vulnerability to chilling temperatures. To achieve this, flower buds from strawberry plants of cv. â€˜Camarosaâ€™ were labelled and monitored from bud initiation until anthesis. Description of morphological and functional changes during flower development was based on histological sections and scanning electron microscopy. To determine the impact of low temperatures at different developmental stages, plants carrying buds of different sizes were chilled at 2 Â°C for 24 h. Several parameters related to male and female gametophyte development were later evaluated in flowers as they approached anthesis. <italic>Fragaria</italic>Ã— <italic>ananassa</italic> flower development was divided into 16 stages according to landmark events. These stages were similar to those documented for <italic>F. vesca</italic> but three new additional intermediate stages were described. Timing of developmental processes was achieved by correlating developmental staging with specific bud sizes and days before anthesis. Time to reach anthesis from early bud stages was 17â€“18 days. During this period, we detected four critical periods vulnerable to low temperatures. These were mostly related to male gametophyte development but also to injury to female organs at late developmental stages. These results provide the essential groundwork on floral biology of cultivated strawberry that is a prerequisite for successful comparative studies of cold tolerance among genotypes during flower formation.Over 95 % of the Earth's surface experiences temperatures below 5 Â°C each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C7">Atkin <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>). On clear days in winter and early spring, plants of extra-tropical regions are subjected to a combination of chilling temperatures and high solar irradiances. These conditions can often damage flower development of fruiting crops and, consequently, depress fruit production, since the capacity of a flower to become a fruit is established before anthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C45">Rodrigo <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>). Cool temperatures therefore have negative effects on fruit set by influencing processes taking place throughout flower development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C36">Mercado <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C5">Ariza <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C6">2012</xref>).These effects can be especially prevalent in annual-fruiting crops such as strawberry that produce flowers throughout the cropping cycle. The commercial strawberry (<italic>Fragaria</italic>Ã— <italic>ananassa</italic> Duch.) is grown from the tropics to the Arctic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C19">Galletta and Bringhurst 1990</xref>), with main production areas in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C48">SalamÃ©-Donoso <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>), Mexico, Turkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C17">FAOSTAT 2014</xref>) and Spain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C33">LÃ³pez-Medina <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C12">Dominguez <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>). In the current growing areas, chilling temperatures are common during late winter and early spring, detrimentally affecting flower development and yields produced in the early season (from January to March; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C5">Ariza <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Good financial returns are closely related to the production of high-quality yields, good flavour, appropriate fruit size and symmetric shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C42">Perkins-Veazie 1995</xref>), but also with the production of early yields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C46">Rowley <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>).Strawberry flowers that develop in early winter are especially prone to chilling. Injury to the inflorescence, anthers and receptacle occurs at temperatures below 0 Â°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C28">Ki and Warmund 1992</xref>) and low temperatures 7 weeks before harvest have been related to misshapen fruit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C6">Ariza <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). Low temperatures also affect the integrity of the floral structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C5">Ariza <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). The negative effects of cold on flower development and fruit production are thought to vary depending on the susceptibility of the processes associated with each floral developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C58">Ohnishi <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). This is cultivar-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C52">Takeda <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>) and depends on the range and duration of the chilling.The suitability to different environments for cultivating strawberry depends on the cultivar; its genetic complexity giving rise to contrasting acclimation abilities in different environments. <italic>Fragaria</italic>Ã— <italic>ananassa</italic> has therefore been termed a microclimatic crop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C44">Rieger 2005</xref>). The genetic complexity of cultivated strawberry is greater than in <italic>F. vesca</italic>, and its octoploid nature gives rise to a multiplicity of flowering responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C21">Heide <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). It may also result in differences during flower development. Although floral development in the diploid <italic>F. vesca</italic> has been well studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C24">Hollender <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>), there is less information for <italic>F.</italic>Ã— <italic>ananassa</italic> and on the effects of chilling during flower differentiation, morphogenesis and maturation of its reproductive structures.The aim of this study was to identify the main processes that comprise flower differentiation in <italic>F.</italic>Ã— <italic>ananassa</italic> and to determine whether they are sensitive to chilling. We used cv. â€˜Camarosaâ€™ (University of California 1992; US Plant Patent #08708), a widely cropped early season short day cultivar, suitable for the major cropping areas. It is intended for use as a model for <italic>F.</italic>Ã— <italic>ananassa</italic> flower development. Its adoption will help to detect which processes are potentially vulnerable to cold temperatures in other strawberry cultivars.Ninety strawberry plants of cv. â€˜Camarosaâ€™ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C30">Larson 2001</xref>), from a commercial high-elevation nursery of Castille-Leon (northeastern Spain; lat. 41Â°30â€²N, long. 4Â°55â€²W, alt. 900 m above sea level), were planted into 6 L pots filled with a commercial substrate (Substrate Projar Professional; Fertilizer N-P-K: 14â€“16â€“18 + micronutrients, Projar<sup>Â®</sup>, Valencia, Spain) and sand (2 : 1, v/v) and, with an over-layer of Perlite. The plants were grown in a controlled temperature glasshouse (22 Â± 2 Â°C and 70 Â± 10 % RH) at the IFAPA Centro de Churriana in MÃ¡laga, Spain.To analyse the time to anthesis (days before anthesis), five primary flower buds from 0.1 to 1.4 cm length were labelled, dated and monitored daily until anthesis. The length of flower buds was determined each day using a digital calliper (Kern<sup>Â®</sup>) and 14 intervals of 1 mm each were linked to a particular floral stage. To characterize the flower, 30 primary flowers were selected 1 day before anthesis. The total number of pollen grains per flower, the percentage of viable and non-viable pollen, ovule viability and immature stigmas were estimated as described below.To analyse the processes of development, three flower buds from each size category were preserved in FAA (5 : 5 : 90 v/v, formalin : acetic acid : 70 % ethanol; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C26">Johansen 1940</xref>) for embedding in paraffin (Paraplast, Merk) or preserved into GAA (glutaraldehide 2.5 % in 0.03 M phosphate buffer) for embedding in synthetic resins (Historesin, Technovit 7100, Microm). Samples were then sectioned with a rotary microtome (Jung supercut, 2065, Leica), stained and observed under stereoscope (Leica, MZ 95) or microscope (Leitz Laborlux 12). Photographs were taken with a digital camera (Canon PowerShot S70, 7.1 Megapixels) and analysed using an image processor program (UTHSCA, Imagen Tool 3.0).Samples embedded in paraffin were sectioned at 10 Î¼m and stained with toluidine blue or PAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C18">Feder and O'Brien 1968</xref>) for observation of the anther and pistil structure and with acetocarmine (40 % acetic acid saturated with carmine; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C35">Mercado <italic>et al</italic>. 1994</xref>) to examine pollen grains. At different buds sizes, 20 anthers and 10 carpels per region of each bud were analysed for the length of outer and inner anthers, length of the receptacle, diameter of pollen grain and length of apical and basal carpels in the receptacle.For a functional approach, three floral buds 0.1, 0.4, 0.6, 1.1 and 1.3 cm long were included in synthetic resin and cut 2 Î¼m thick. The tissues were then stained with acridine orange to detect cellular activity (i.e. synthesis of RNA and DNA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C13">Dudley <italic>et al</italic>. 1987</xref>), with aniline blue to identify callose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C10">Currier 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C32">Linskens and Esser 1957</xref>) and with Auramine O to detect lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C23">Heslop-Harrison 1977</xref>). Observations were made under a light microscope equipped with UV epifluorescence using a band pass 355â€“425 exciter filter and an LP 460 barrier filter.Anthers, carpels and pollen were also observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Jeol, JSM 840). Five flower buds of each category were submerged in 100 % ethanol after removing sepals and petals. The samples were dehydrated at critical point in liquid CO<sub>2</sub> in a Balzers CPD-030. Dehydrated material was mounted on stubs and coated with gold in a Jeol, JFC 1100 sputter coater prior to SEM photography.After flowering initiation, 30 plants were transferred to a phytotron (IBERCEX, ASL S.A.) at 2 Â°C for 24 h with a photoperiod of 11 h, and then returned to the glasshouse. A batch of 30 plants kept in the glasshouse served as controls. Before chilling, all the flower buds were dated and monitored up to 2 days before anthesis. Five to 10 flowers per treatment at each bud stage were observed under a microscope at the same time.To evaluate the effect of chilling on male structures, the total number of pollen grains per flower, percentage of germinated pollen grains and percentage of non-viable pollen were recorded in control and chilled plants. Anthers from 5 to 10 flowers per treatment were placed in Petri dishes inside a sealed dry chambers containing silica gel for 24 h to promote release of pollen grains. The pollen was placed in 1.5 mL vials and 150 Î¼L of a germination medium consisting of 10 % glucose and 150 ppm boric acid added (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C3">Ariza <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>). Two aliquots of the solution were separated to estimate the number of pollen grains and to assess pollen viability. To estimate the number of pollen grains per flower, pollen stained with 1 % acetocarmine was counted using a Neubauer chamber under an optical microscope (Leitz, Laborlux 12). Viability of the pollen at each date was assessed by incubating vials for 4 h at room temperature under light conditions and continuous shaking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C25">Hortynski and Zebrowska 1991</xref>) before staining with 1.0 % acetocarmine. Germination <italic>in vitro</italic> was examined for âˆ¼200 pollen grains by light microscopy (Leitz, Laborlux 12, Germany; Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV012F2">2</xref>E). Pollen was considered viable and fertile when the length of the tube was greater than or equal to the diameter of the grain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C35">Mercado <italic>et al</italic>. 1994</xref>). The percentage of germinated pollen was estimated on the basis of the number of stained pollen grains (undisrupted and potentially viable). The percentage of non-viable pollen was calculated from the number of non-stained pollen grains.To analyse the effect of the chilling on ovule viability and development of the stigmas, 20 carpels per flower were squashed and stained with aniline blue for observation by light microscopy. Carpels were separated into tubular- (Type I), heart- (Type II) and scalloped-shaped (Type III) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C5">Ariza <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>) and the percentage of immature stigmas calculated. Carpels with Type I and II stigmas were considered immature, and Type III stigmas were mature and receptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C5">Ariza <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). An ovule was considered aborted if it stained with aniline blue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C2">Anvari and StÃ¶sser 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C5">Ariza <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>).Statistical analyses were performed using the analytical software STATISTIX 9.0 (Analytical Software, Tallahassee, FL, USA). To test the relationship between days before anthesis and flower bud sizes, length of anthers, diameter of pollen grain and length of carpels, lineal regression models were used. To evaluate the effect of chilling on the percentage of germinated pollen grains, percentage of non-viable pollen, number of pollen grains, type of stigma and percentage of aborted ovules, data of these variables from flowers at the same bud stage when chilling were subjected to a one-way ANOVA (<italic>n</italic> = 5â€“10 flowers per date). Prior to ANOVA, percentage data were transformed by arcsine and normality and homogeneity assumptions were tested by Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov and Cochran's <italic>C</italic> tests. Data were back-transformed to give the percentages of decrease or the fold increase.At anthesis, <italic>F.</italic>Ã— <italic>ananassa</italic> flowers have a two whorl calyx (inner and outer) of 12.8 Â± 0.2 alternating sepals. A whorl of 5.3 Â± 0.1 white petals is present interior to the sepals. Subsequently, two whorls (inner and outer) of 22.8 Â± 0.3 stamens form and surround the central receptacle dome. Each flower carries 248 384 Â± 12 469 pollen grains; of which 47.9 Â± 1.9 % are viable and 13.7 Â± 0.7 % are non-viable. The pistil of each flower is the innermost whorl made up of 326 Â± 18 carpels. Each carpel consists of a stigma, a style an ovary and one ovule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C20">Hancock 1999</xref>). Carpels are embedded in the epidermis of the receptacle in a spiral pattern. The percentage of immature stigmas and aborted ovules was 7.7 Â± 1.4 % and 12.3 Â± 1.2 %, respectively. These results highlight a degree of functional failure of the reproductive structures in <italic>F.</italic>Ã— <italic>ananassa</italic> under non-stressful conditions. However, these modest levels of failure do not necessarily translate into reduce fruit set or damage to development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C5">Ariza <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C6">2012</xref>).Relationship between days before anthesis and length of flower bud in cultivated strawberry.

Histological sections embedded in historesin are stained with Auramine O (green coloured) and aniline blue (blue coloured). Non-coloured pollen photographs are directly observed after squashing. Three-dimensional images of anthers and pollen were acquired by scanning electron microscopy.At stage 10b (0.5â€“0.6 cm, 11â€“10 days before anthesis), pollen grains were round but only stained with Auramine O (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV012F3">3</xref>K and L), indicating an outer layer of lipids (i.e. the exine). Secretion of the exine precursors is mediated by tapetum cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C39">Pacini and Juniper 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C59">Scott <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C56">Yang <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>) which also nourish the microspores during microspore maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C38">Pacini 1990</xref>). These lipids contribute to the ornamentation of the pollen wall. There were also three apertures (i.e. the colpos) along the grain (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV012F3">3</xref>T and U). Also, at this stage, fibrous bands on the epidermis and endothecium cells of the anther walls become evident (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV012F3">3</xref>K and L). This may indicate initiation of tapetum degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C24">Hollender <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). These cells continue to grow (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV012F3">3</xref>M, P, R and S).At stage 11a (0.7â€“0.9 cm, 9â€“6 days before anthesis), the final size of pollen grain was reached (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV012F3">3</xref>Q and T). This is a time when the tapetum becomes fully degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C24">Hollender <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>) as a consequence of programmed cell death occurring at later stages of pollen development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C27">Kawanabe <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>).At stage 11b (1.0â€“1.2 cm, 5â€“3 days before anthesis) pollen mitotic division occurs that creates the vegetative and generative nuclei. This observation agrees with that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C24">Hollender <italic>et al</italic>. (2012)</xref> and with our later results on critical periods of susceptibility to low temperature discussed below. Anther dehiscence takes place at stage 13a (1.3 cm) and 1â€“2 days before anthesis. This occurs when flower buds are 1.4â€“1.5 cm long (stage 13b).Micrographs of pistil development of <italic>F.</italic>Ã— <italic>ananassa</italic> flower buds at different developmental stages (Stg): stage 8 (A), stage 9a (B and C), stage 9b (D), stage 10a (Eâ€“H), stage 10b (I), stage 11a (Jâ€“L), stage 11b (Mâ€“P) and stage 13a (Qâ€“T). Histological sections embedded in paraffin were stained with PAS or toluidine blue (shown in black and white) for structural examination. Samples embedded in historesin were stained with auramine O (green coloured) and acridine orange (yellow coloured) for a morpho-functional approach. Three-dimensional images of stigmas were acquired by scanning electron microscopy.From stage 10b (0.5â€“0.6 cm, 11â€“10 days before anthesis) to stage 11a (0.7â€“0.9 cm, 9â€“6 days before anthesis), rapid elongation of the style, accompanied by ovary expansion, takes place and carpels shaped like a music-note can be observed at the receptacle base (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV012F4">4</xref>Iâ€“L). This is associated with the prevalence of DNA synthesis.At stage 11b (1.0â€“1.2 cm, 5â€“3 days before anthesis) the â€˜music-noteâ€™ carpels reach their maximum size (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV012F4">4</xref>M), the ovary is completely formed (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV012F4">4</xref>N and O) and the stigmas become scalloped (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV012F4">4</xref>P). The three consecutive mitosis of the chalazal megaspore may then generate the embryo sac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C60">Souza <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C54">Yang 2005</xref>). This is in accordance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C24">Hollender <italic>et al</italic>. (2012)</xref> and with the observed vulnerability of this stage to low temperatures (see below).Finally, at stage 13a (1.3 cm, 2â€“1 days before anthesis), mature and receptive scalloped-shaped stigma were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C4">Ariza <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C5">2011</xref>). These stigmas displayed a high metabolic activity, which is consistent with observed lipid secretion on the stigma surface (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV012F4">4</xref>Râ€“T) which aids adhesion of the pollen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C8">Avigdori-Avidov 1986</xref>). These findings suggest that at 1 or 2 days pre-anthesis flower reproductive structures are fully functional in cultivated strawberry.Low-temperature critical periods (grey bands) in days before anthesis of strawberry flower development, detected after subjecting flowers buds at different developmental stages to chilling (24 h at 2 Â°C). Periods were identified when strawberry flowers at stage 13a displayed significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; <italic>n</italic> = 5â€“10) differences between the cold and control treatments in any of the following variables: number of pollen grains, percentage of germinated pollen, percentage of unviable pollen, percentage of immature stigmas and percentage of aborted ovules. The <italic>n</italic>-fold increase or the decrease percentages for each variable are depicted in the dark grey bands and light grey bands, respectively.The earliest stage showing susceptibility to low temperatures is male gametophyte development at stage 8 or before (20â€“17 days before anthesis). This was revealed as a significant decrease (up to 82 %) in the number of pollen grains, and by a 4-fold increase of the percentage of non-viable pollen (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV012F5">5</xref>). These results demonstrate that temperature &lt;2 Â°C negatively affect PMC development and anthers differentiation on endothecium, middle layer and tapetum, respectively.The second stage showing chilling susceptibility was detected 15â€“14 days before anthesis (stages 9a and 9b). Here a decrease in the number of pollen grains per flower by up to 57 % was observed. This effect has been previously associated with disruption of PMCs meiosis under high temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C29">Kim <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C16">Erickson and Markhart 2002</xref>). Likewise, our results reveal that meiosis of PMCs in cultivated strawberry is also sensitive to low temperature. This is in agreement with recent studies reporting signs of cytomixis of PMCs at prophase I, contributing to the death of PMCs, as a consequence of chilling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C9">Barton <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>).A third chilling sensitive stage occurs 10â€“7 days before anthesis (stages 10b and 11a). Dame here decreased the number of pollen grains by 73 %, indicating that microspore development and tapetum degeneration are affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C40">Parish <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). Pollen sterility induced by cold might be due to a disruption of sugar metabolism in the tapetum, ultimately abolishing starch accumulation (i.e. energy reserves) and exine secretion by the pollen grains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C37">Oliver <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>).Finally, chilling 5â€“3 days before anthesis (stage 11b) decreased the percentage of germinated pollen grains by 49 % and increased percentage of non-viable pollen by 1.7-fold. This indicates that microspore mitotic processes are being disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C49">Satake and Hayase 1970</xref>), an effect probably associated with microtubules disassembly during mitosis. Microtubules are known to be highly thermosensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C22">Hepler and Hush 1996</xref>). On the other hand, chilling decreased the number of pollen grains by 60 %. This may be a result of physical disruption of pollen grains and of cell death induced by deleterious effect of low temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C57">Zinn <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>).Female reproductive organs were only affected by chilling 3â€“6 days before anthesis (stages 11a to 11b) when there was up to a 2.4- and 4.8-fold increase in the percentage of aborted ovules or of immature stigmas, respectively (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV012F5">5</xref>). This suggests that low temperatures damage embryo sac formation and delays stigmas maturation. Both these phases are thus cold sensitive. This agrees with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C15">Ebadi <italic>et al</italic>. (1995)</xref> who reported a decline in ovule viability by low temperatures before anthesis. In contrast, other reports showed that low temperatures did not affect ovule and stigma receptivity in strawberry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C5">Ariza <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). These discrepancies must be related to differences in the range of chilling temperatures tested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C5">Ariza <italic>et al</italic>. (2011)</xref> and in the present study (&gt;4 and 2 Â°C, respectively). This suggests that female reproductive structures and esporogenesis of cultivated strawberry are fairly tolerant to temperatures &gt;2 Â°C. These findings underline the lower sensitivity of female reproductive processes to cold temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C14">Dupuis and Dumas 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C47">Saini and Lalonde 1997</xref>). The chilling sensitivity of other strawberry cultivars now needs to be addressed since responses to environmental stress are often cultivar-related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C31">Ledesma <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>).Stages of flower development and key events in pollen and carpel development of cultivated (<italic>F.</italic>Ã— <italic>ananassa</italic>) and wild strawberry (<italic>F. vesca</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV012C24">Hollender <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). Italics denote those events that are inferred from <italic>F. vesca</italic>. The asterisk indicates those events vulnerable to chilling injury. <sup>1</sup>Described in stage 12 on <italic>F. vesca</italic>.In addition to contributing to the knowledge of the floral biology of Rosaceae, and strawberry, the present study implicates particular developmental processes as potentially sensitive to low temperature. The findings will also aid future comparative studies of species or cultivars aimed at identifying differences in tolerance and susceptibility. Such work will benefit breeders and growers working in areas where sudden down-shifts of temperature take place during the cropping cycle, especially during flowering.This research was funded by the <grant-sponsor id="cs1" rid="cn1" xlink:type="simple">Spanish Instituto Nacional de InvestigaciÃ³n Agraria (INIA)</grant-sponsor> <grant-num id="cn1" rid="cs1" xlink:type="simple">RTA2004-008 and CC10-009-C02-02</grant-num> projects, and co-financed by European FEDER funds.
