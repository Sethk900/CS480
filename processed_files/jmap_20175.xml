A critical evaluation of the upper ocean heat budget in the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis data for the south central equatorial PacificCoupled ocean–atmospheric models suffer from the common bias of a spurious rain belt south of the central equatorial Pacific throughout the year. Observational constraints on key processes responsible for this bias are scarce. The recently available reanalysis from a coupled model system for the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) data is a potential benchmark for climate models in this region. Its suitability for model evaluation and validation, however, needs to be established. This paper examines the mixed layer heat budget and the ocean surface currents—key factors for the sea surface temperature control in the double Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone in the central Pacific—from 5°S to 10°S and 170°E to 150°W. Two independent approaches are used. The first approach is through comparison of CFSR data with collocated station observations from field experiments; the second is through the residual analysis of the heat budget of the mixed layer. We show that the CFSR overestimates the net surface flux in this region by 23 W m – 2. The overestimated net surface flux is mainly due to an even larger overestimation of shortwave radiation by 44 W m – 2, which is compensated by a surface latent heat flux overestimated by 14 W m – 2. However, the quality of surface currents and the associated oceanic heat transport in CFSR are not compromised by the surface flux biases, and they agree with the best available estimates. The uncertainties of the observational data from field experiments are also briefly discussed in the present study.
