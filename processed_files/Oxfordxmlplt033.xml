Environmental conditions have forced plants to develop elaborated molecular strategies to surpass natural obstacles to growth and proliferation. Elements in multiple signaling cascades allow plants to sense multiple and simultaneous ambient cues, and establish an opportune defensive response. A group of versatile master regulators of gene expression are decisive to control plant responses to stressing conditions. For crop breeding purposes, the task is to determine how to activate these key regulators to enable accurate and optimal responses to stressing conditions. In this review, we discuss how and which master regulators are implied in the responses to biotic and stresses, their evolution in the life kingdoms, and the interaction with other molecular factors that lead to a proper and efficient plant response.  From the first land plants to the complex gymnosperms and angiosperms of today, environmental conditions have forced plants to develop molecular strategies to surpass natural obstacles to growth and proliferation, and these genetic gains have been transmitted to the following generations. In this long natural process, novel and elaborate mechanisms have evolved to enable plants to cope with environmental limitations. Elements in many signalling cascades enable plants to sense different, multiple and simultaneous ambient cues. A group of versatile master regulators of gene expression control plant responses to stressing conditions. For crop breeding purposes, the task is to determine how to activate these key regulators to enable accurate and optimal reactions to common stresses. In this review, we discuss how plants sense biotic and abiotic stresses, how and which master regulators are implied in the responses to these stresses, their evolution in the life kingdoms, and the domains in these proteins that interact with other factors to lead to a proper and efficient plant response.  Plants are continuously exposed to harmful environmental conditions, and biotic and abiotic stressors limit crop yield and also the land-use on earth. To guarantee success in the adaptation and survival to limiting growth conditions, plants have developed diverse stress-responsive signalling pathways. Once adverse environmental cues are perceived, they are transmitted to different cellular action centres, resulting in activation of mechanisms that prepare the plant for adaptation. The expeditious integration of the stress signals and the activated adaptation/defence mechanisms allow plants to grow in adverse environments. Plant stress evasive strategies involve a multilevel reorganization with changes in energetic, metabolic, transcriptional, growth and proliferation profiles. This massive and complex restructuring is dynamically regulated in response to the type, severity and duration of one or a combination of stresses ( Atkinson and Urwin 2012 ). Plants are able to display strategic defence responses when two stressors occur at the same time, and this response can be, in some cases, distinctive from the response to either individual stress ( Koussevitzky  et al.  2008 ). Bipartite protective responses may indicate that plants economize molecular resources in order to improve the chances of survival. These differential responses also provide evidence for molecular components that coordinately integrate multiple signals and responses such as extensive gene expression reprogramming ( Munoz and Castellano 2012 ). These master regulators positively or negatively control the transcription of a wide variety of genes that are involved in the mechanisms for plant adaptation and survival. These central regulatory hubs allow for a rapid and efficient transcriptional remodelling, increasing the plasticity in the general stress response. Master regulators may directly associate with the promoter regions of genes or may indirectly control gene expression by activation of transcription factors (TFs) or general repressors. Some master regulators are able to directly inhibit the activity of key metabolic enzymes that are decisive for energy homoeostasis in the cell. Some of the most important master regulators found in plants have a high degree of cross-species conservation. This evolutionary conservation is observed at both structural and functional levels.  In this work, we review the current state of our knowledge of master regulators of transcription in plants involved in the response to environmental constraints. We discuss their key roles in plant adaptation during adverse conditions of biotic and abiotic stresses. We analyse their regulatory activities, their dynamic and specific conformation, their interaction with associated molecules, type-stress specificity, possible participation in different stress-signalling pathways and their evolution among life kingdoms. Finally, we discuss the relevance of these master regulators to engineering of crops to meet the needs of the changing world.  The plant defence response to pathogens involves the perception of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors and the activation of the basal immune response; this immunity response is called pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) ( Jones and Dangl 2006 ;  Lacombe  et al.  2010 ). Some microbial pathogens possess effectors that counteract the function of components in the PTI signalling cascade. Plant disease resistance proteins may then induce a gene-for-gene resistance described by  Flor (1971) ; this second level of plant defence response is known as effector-triggered immunity (ETI) ( Abramovitch  et al.  2003 ;  Gassmann and Bhattacharjee 2012 ). Recent results suggest that pattern recognition receptors interact physically with resistance proteins, evidence that PTI and ETI receptors can reside in the same protein complex and that PTI and ETI signalling likely interact at very early stages ( Qi  et al.  2011 ). The increase in cytosolic Ca 2+  is an early event in the elicitor-sensing mechanism in plant cells; calcium signatures contain encrypted information that is decoded into specific biological responses ( Scrase-Field and Knight 2003 ;  Lecourieux  et al.  2006 ;  Monshausen 2012 ). In the plant–pathogen interaction, plants often release peptide signals referred to as damaged-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). These molecules also induce defence responses to the microbial intruders ( Krol  et al.  2010 ;  Ma  et al.  2012 ). The activation of the defence responses by PAMPs and DAMPs induces a cytosolic Ca 2+  burst. Recent studies have linked cGMP-activated Ca 2+ -conducting ion channels to the induction of  immune response signalling. These receptors actuate synergistically to generate a Ca 2+  signal signature that eventually results in defence gene expression and the hypersensitive response ( Ma  et al.  2012 ).  NPR1 is a master transcriptional regulator of genes activated by different biotic stresses. Diverse biotic stresses (attack by pathogenic bacteria and fungi) or mechanical stressors (herbivory or wounding) cause an increment in the intracellular levels of SA. This increment causes an elevation in the redox status of the cell that in consequence promotes the monomerization of NPR1 ( n on-expressor of  p athogenesis- r elated (PR) protein genes) oligomers. Then monomers of NPR1 act as receptors for SA and can be translocated to the nucleus to exert its regulatory activities. Once in the nucleus, NPR1 interacts with TGA2, TGA5 and TGA6 transcriptional factors. These interactions are essential to activate the transcription of PR genes and induce SAR. NPR3 and NPR4 will act also as SA receptors and promote NPR1 degradation via proteasome.  NPR1 is the receptor of the endogenous phytohormone SA ( Wu  et al . 2012 ). NPR3 and NPR4, two paralogues of NPR1, also bind SA with different affinities. NPR3 and NPR4 act as Cullin 3 (CUL3) ubiquitin ligase adaptors for NPR1 proteasome degradation. In the absence of pathogen challenge when the levels of SA are low, most NPR1 are removed by CUL3-NPR4-mediated degradation. Even at basal levels of SA, some amount of NPR1 escapes degradation ( Fu  et al.  2012 ). It is also possible that accumulation of H 2 O 2  in cytoplasm prevents the nuclear translocation of NPR1 ( Peleg-Grossman  et al.  2010 ). In  Nicotiana tabacum , NtTTG2, a protein bearing a WD40 protein interaction domain, impedes the nuclear localization of NPR1 abolishing PR gene transcription ( Li  et al . 2012 a  ).  NPR1 is a negative regulator of signalling through another phytohormone, jasmonic acid (JA) ( Spoel  et al.  2003 ;  Gfeller  et al.  2010 ). In rice, the antisense expression of  OsNPR1  (as-npr1) results in a 50 % reduction in gene transcription and increased levels of JA, ethylene (ET) and herbivore-induced trypsin proteinase inhibitors. The antisense expression also reduced the effects of the rice striped stem borer ( Chilo suppressalis ) ( Li  et al . 2012 b  ). The master regulator function in NPR1 is explained in part by a broad complex, tramtrack bric à brac/poxvirus and zinc finger (BTB/POZ) domain located in the N-terminal region, through which it interacts with TGACG motif-binding (TGA) bZIP-type TFs (TGA2, TGA5 and TGA6), and a C-terminal transactivation domain (Cys-oxidized domain) required for the specific interaction with TGA2 to form a transactivating complex called the enhanceosome ( Rochon  et al.  2006 ). PR gene expression in SAR is dependent on the functionally redundant TGAs ( Zhang  et al . 1999 ) (Fig.  1 ). TGA TFs were first described in pea and tobacco. These TFs recognize repeats of TGACG motifs in the 35S promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus, originally named activation sequence factor 1 ( Lam  et al.  1989 ). The TGA TFs in plants are involved in the expression of defence genes in response to SA ( Lebel  et al.  1998 ), and their interaction with NPR1 enhances their DNA binding activity ( Despres  et al.  2000 ). Other NPR1-interacting proteins include NIM1-interacting (NIMIN) proteins, NIMIN-1, NIMIN-2 and NIMIN-3. NIMIN-1 and -2 proteins interact with the C-terminal regions of NPR1 through a common binding motif, whereas NIMIN-3 interacts with the N-terminal region of NPR1. These NPR1–NIMIN heterodimers interact with the basic leucine zipper TFs of the TGA family ( Weigel  et al.  2001 ). There are some differences in sequences between NPR1 proteins from plant species, for example, between  A. thaliana  and  N. tabacum , but NPR1 and NPR1-like proteins all harbour the penta-amino acid motif LENRV and a strictly conserved binding site for NIMIN proteins. It appears that distinct threshold levels of cellular SA are sensed by SA-sensitive complexes formed by NPR1 and NIMIN proteins ( Maier  et al.  2011 ).

For more information on each interaction, refer to Tables  1 – 4 .  In the last two decades, several molecular players that integrate signals from signalling pathways activated in response to biotic stress have been described. One of these is the Mediator complex, the conserved four-module multiprotein unit initially discovered in yeast and later described in fungi, metazoans and plants ( Mathur  et al.  2011 ). Mediator is involved in the RNA PolII-catalysed transcription ( Kelleher  et al.  1990 ). It is an essential component in the transcriptional machinery in eukaryotes ( Bourbon 2008 ) that promotes the assembly and activation of transcription complexes on core promoters, interacts with RNA PolII in the initiation of transcription and serves as a primary conduit of regulatory information from enhancers to promoters, integrating positive and negative regulatory information ( Myers and Kornberg 2000 ;  Kuras  et al.  2003 ). Mediator is a multicomponent complex composed of at least 34 subunits in plants; 25 and 30 subunits are found in yeast and metazoans, respectively ( Mathur  et al.  2011 ).  Arabidopsis  Mediator subunits have very low homology compared with other species. In  Arabidopsis , there are at least 21 conserved and six novel (specific) Mediator subunits ( Backstrom  et al.  2007 ). A Mediator subunit with an integrative signalling function characterized in  A. thaliana  and other plant species is Med25. In  A. thaliana , the  PHYTOCHROME AND FLOWERING TIME1  ( PFT1 ) gene encodes the Med25 subunit ( Backstrom  et al.  2007 ) and is required for jasmonate-dependent defence gene expression and basal resistance to leaf-infecting necrotrophic fungal pathogens, acting as a positive regulator of defence gene expression. Interestingly,  PFT1  is a susceptible host factor that facilitates the colonization by  Fusarium oxysporum , a root-infecting hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen that requires intact JA-dependent signalling in the host ( Kidd  et al . 2009 ;  Thatcher  et al . 2009 ). Med25 in  Arabidopsis  regulates a spectrum of signalling pathways by means of selective interaction with specific TFs that differentially regulate the JA and abscisic acid (ABA) cascades. Med25 interacts physically with the MYC2 TF in the promoter regions of  MYC2  target genes to enhance their expression. MYC2 and Med25 also interact with ABA-Insensitive 5 (ABI5), a leucine zipper TF, in the promoter regions of  ABI5  target genes and have a negative effect in the expression of these genes ( Chen  et al . 2012 b  ). Med25 interacts directly with three TFs of the AP2-EREBP (APETALA2 and ET-responsive element binding proteins) family, and these three TFs interact directly with the GCC-box of  PDF1.2 , a gene regulated also under the cascade of JA, suggesting that Med25 regulates  PDF1.2  transcription ( Ou  et al.  2011 ).  Furthermore, Med25 participates in regulating essential developmental processes, such as flowering and organ size determination, integrates environmental cues to development control ( Elfving  et al.  2011 ) and is involved in controlling root hair differentiation by maintaining reactive-oxygen species distribution ( Sundaravelpandian  et al.  2013 ). In the signalling to the process of flowering induction, two RING-H2 proteins target Med25 for degradation by a mechanism called ‘activation by destruction’. Proteolysis of Med25 is necessary for transcription of the  FLOWERING LOCUS T  gene ( Inigo  et al.  2012 a  ). A study under contrasting conditions of temperature and light quality, transcriptome comparisons of  Arabidopsis pft1  (a  Med25  mutant) and the transcriptome after  F. oxysporum  attack found that  Med25  is at the hub in the integration of several abiotic stimuli and JA-dependent defences ( Inigo  et al.  2012 b  ). Other subunits of the Mediator complex are also involved in transduction signalling in response to a wide spectrum of environmental stress and developmental processes.  Med16 , known in  Arabidopsis  as  SFR6 , is implicated in both SA- and JA-mediated defence gene expression, and in tolerance to  Pseudomonas syringae  infection ( Wathugala  et al.  2012 ).  Med8  in  Arabidopsis  is also involved in regulation of pathogen resistance and acts both independently and in concert with  Med25. Med8  also regulates flowering time ( Kidd  et al . 2009 ), cell expansion and organ growth ( Xu and Li 2012 ).  Transcription factors and proteins in interaction with PFT1 (Med25) in  A. thaliana  inferred from the BioGRID database.  Repertoire of signalling pathways in plants in response to environmental cues, biotic and abiotic stresses, with Mediator as a central actor in the scene. (A) A JA-dependent signalling cascade activated in response to necrotrophic pathogens, implying Med25 in the Mediator complex, MYC2 TF and the activation of MYC2 target genes. (B) Two signalling cascades: the first activated in response to environmental cues through Med25 in the Mediator complex, ABI5 TF, leading to a repression of ABI5 target genes; and the second, phyB as receptor of light signals (shade), acting through Med25 in Mediator and bHLH and bZIP TFs and the expression of target genes. In a category of ‘activation by destruction’, from signals originating in environmental cues, Med25 is proteasome-degraded and coupled to the activation of  FLOWERING LOCUS T  ( FT ), florigen production and flowering in plants. Med8 involved in cell expansion and organ growth by a route independent of Med25. (C) Salt and drought stresses are sensed by a signalling cascade through Med25 in Mediator, DREB and MYB-like TFs and the expression of their respective genes. Under freezing or UV light stressing conditions, the Mediator subunit involved is Med16. The Mediator complex regulates transcription by mediating interactions between transcriptional activators and RNA PolII.  It has been demonstrated that interactions between transcriptional activators and Mediator subunits involve a two-step binding mechanism that induces conformational changes in the Mediator subunit–activator–DNA complex ( Wands  et al.  2011 ) or in the bimolecular complex of Mediator subunit–transcriptional regulator, with changes in the energetic and structural parameters of the involved proteins, changes that in turn modify their binding affinity ( Blomberg  et al.  2012 ). Recent mass spectrometry and dynamic transcriptome analysis indicates that 17 Mediator subunits in  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  during non-stress conditions are phosphorylated at multiple sites. Phosphorylation presumably prevents stress response gene transcription under non-stress conditions, supporting the idea that a dynamic and differential Mediator subunit phosphorylation contributes to gene regulation in eukaryotic cells ( Miller  et al.  2012 ). In addition, analysis of the effect of different phytohormones and stresses on the transcript level of Mediator subunit genes in  Arabidopsis  revealed that environmental cues impact the stoichiometric ratios of Mediator subunits by affecting differentially the transcription of the respective genes ( Pasrija and Thakur 2012 ). Furthermore, alternative splicing may regulate the activity of some Mediator subunits:  Med12  and  Med19  are alternatively spliced in human endothelial cells ( Rienzo  et al.  2012 ).  Plants have evolved a variety of elaborate mechanisms to respond and adapt to a broad range of environmental stressors. In abiotic stress, as in biotic stress, extensive gene networks finely regulate the molecular mechanisms that lead to the assembly of an integral stress response. These molecular networks are intercalated and hierarchical nodes mediate crosstalk. The master regulators sit at these nodes.  In abiotic stress, as in biotic stress, the Mediator complex plays a critical role. As noted previously, Mediator is an integrator of regulatory signals that converge on promoters of stress-responsive genes. In plants, several Mediator subunits have been functionally linked to gene transcription regulation in response to diverse stress-specific signalling pathways ( Kim  et al . 2006 ). For example, Med25 interacts with TFs in the pathways activated by salt (ZFHD1), drought (DREB2A) and heat stress (MYB-like protein); Med25 is also involved in regulating flowering time in response to light conditions ( Rizhsky  et al . 2004 ;  Elfving  et al . 2011 ). In germination of  Arabidopsis med25  mutants, the negative effect of salt stress is evident at a low concentration of NaCl (50 mM); these effects are even stronger than those due to a mutation in  dreb2a , the gene encoding a TF involved in drought stress response (Fig.  3 ). It has been suggested that Med25 has the opposite function of DREB2A in the response to drought ( Elfving  et al.  2011 ). Med25 interacts with TFs through its conserved activator-interacting domain (amino acids 551–680); the kinetics of the Med25–TF interaction depends on the TF ( Elfving  et al.  2011 ). ZFHD1 is involved in response to drought and high salinity and is activated by ABA treatment. Overexpression of  ZFHD1  in  Arabidopsis  results in higher drought tolerance ( Tran  et al.  2007 ). DREB2A interacts with genes containing the dehydration-responsive element/C-repeat triggering gene expression due to cold or drought; in a constitutively active form, it enhances drought tolerance ( Sakuma  et al.  2006 ). MYB-like TFs, specifically MYB-At1g26580, were elevated when plants were exposed to a combination of drought and heat stress, indicating their possible participation in regulating the transcription of responsible genes to both stressors ( Rizhsky  et al . 2004 ).  Med16, another subunit of Mediator, was first described in  Arabidopsis  as  SENSITIVE TO FREEZING6  ( SFR6 ), and was later identified as a component of the Mediator transcriptional co-activator. Med16 is implicated in cold- and drought-inducible gene transcription, in tolerance to freezing and osmotic stress, and the response to UV-C irradiation ( Wathugala  et al.  2012 ). Expression profile comparisons of Mediator subunits in rice and  Arabidopsis  show that 29 genes encoding Mediator subunits in rice and four in  Arabidopsis  are differentially expressed in at least one of three stress conditions (desiccation, cold or salt stress) ( Mathur  et al.  2011 ).  In silico  and genome-wide expression analysis of plant Mediator subunit genes under stress conditions revealed differential transcript abundance and alternative forms of Mediator complexes in different cell types and developmental stages ( Mathur  et al.  2011 ). The broad participation of the Mediator complex in different situations of abiotic and biotic stress is supported in part by the plasticity of the Mediator subunits to adopt alternative conformations that may enhance specific interactions among the subunits or with particular TFs (Fig.  3 , Table  2 ).  NPR1 is another master regulator of abiotic stress, although it perhaps does not have the same relevance to abiotic as to biotic stress. Rice plants engineered to overexpress  Arabidopsis NPR1  exhibit a lesion-mimic/cell death phenotype when exposed to a certain quality of light; rice plants overexpressing NPR1 are hypersensitive to light ( Fitzgerald  et al.  2004 ).  Arabidopsis  NPR1 acts as a negative regulator of the transcription of several rice genes:  rab21  (a rice dehydrin),  salT  (encoding salt-stress-induced protein) and  dip1  (encoding dehydration-stress-inducible protein). Transgenic rices expressing  Arabidopsis AtNPR1  are hypersensitive to salt and drought stresses ( Quilis  et al.  2008 ). AtNPR1 is likely a key component in the brassinosteroid-mediated increased tolerance to heat and salt stress ( Divi  et al.  2010 ). Brassinosteroids, a group of steroidal phytohormones, are implicated in regulation of plant cell growth and morphogenesis ( Wang  et al . 2012 ) as well as adaptation to biotic and abiotic stresses ( Kutschera and Wang 2012 ).  The SNF1-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1) in plants is homologous to sucrose-non-fermentation1 (SNF1) from yeast and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in mammals, and is a well-documented central regulator in pathways that signal energy deprivation in plants. Plants, unlike mammals and yeast, express a large family of SnRKs that are classified into three subgroups, SnRK1, SnRK2 and SnRK3, based on sequence similarities and domain structures. The SnRK1 subgroup, with only three members in  Arabidopsis , is the most closely related of the subgroups to SNF1 from yeast and AMPK from animals ( Hrabak  et al.  2003 ). Energy deprivation results from abiotic stress associated with most environmental perturbations, such as oxygen hypoxia related to flooding, drought, extreme temperatures and even pathogen attack ( Baena-Gonzalez 2010 ). KIN10 and KIN11, two representative kinases of the SnRK1 group, are involved in responses to darkness, hypoxia and herbicide (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea) treatment in  Arabidopsis . These kinases act through G-box binding TFs, specifically GBF5/bZIP2, which can bind the G-box  cis -element present in the promoter of the dark-induced gene  DIN6 . Analysis of gene expression profiles under sugar and energy starvation conditions identified 278 genes co-activated by KIN10 and sugar starvation and co-repressed in sugar-treated seedlings ( Baena-Gonzalez  et al.  2007 ). These data place KIN10 and KIN11 as central integrators in the regulation of the transcription of genes involved in the response to energy starvation stress and in modulation of primary and secondary metabolism including protein synthesis. A recent study demonstrated that SnRK1-type kinases induce stress-responsive gene expression through translocation to the nucleus where it associates with target genes in response to oxygen deprivation under flooding conditions ( Cho  et al.  2012 ). Hormonal signalling in ABA, auxin and cytokinin pathways also exhibits connections with SnRK1. Abscisic acid is a central regulator of plant responses to osmotic stress ( Hubbard  et al.  2010 ).  Arabidopsis  plants overexpressing  SnRK1.1  have hypersensitivity to exogenous ABA ( Jossier  et al.  2009 ). Thus, the SnRK1 family members control hormone-mediated signalling in abiotic stress. The biological function of these central regulators may be amplified by their inherent kinase activity and their capacity to interact with and activate the transcription of specific target genes in the nuclear space.  Transcription factors and proteins in interaction with KIN10 (At3g01090) in  A. thaliana  inferred from the BioGRID database.  Transcription factors and proteins in interaction with KIN11 (At3g29160) in  A. thaliana  inferred from the BioGRID database.  These results indicate the importance of SNRK as a sensor and master regulator of the energetic and metabolic status of plant cells as well as active participation during adaptation to diverse abiotic stressors.  Target of rapamycin (TOR) is a serine/threonine kinase conserved in fungi, insects, mammals and photosynthetic eukaryotes. Target of rapamycin is a master regulator of cell growth and proliferation having a central role in regulation of cell growth and development ( Kunz  et al.  1993 ;  Ren  et al.  2011 ). Target of rapamycin integrates intracellular signals that depend on nutrient availability, cellular energy status (ATP) and extracellular signals such as growth factors. Also, TOR is another example of a molecular player that integrates signals originating under abiotic stress. Eukaryotic TORs are conserved proteins of ∼280 kDa that have 40–60 % sequence homology at the amino acid level. In yeast, isoforms  TOR1  and  TOR2  have with 80 % of amino acid similarity, a partially redundant function ( Kunz  et al.  1993 ), whereas in animals and plants there is a single copy of  TOR . In  Arabidopsis , loss-of-function mutants lead to embryonic lethality ( Menand  et al.  2002 ;  Ren  et al.  2011 ).  Rapamycin, an antiproliferative drug produced by  Streptomyces hygroscopicus  ( Schmelzle and Hall 2000 ) originally described as an antifungal agent ( Vezina  et al.  1975 ), binds to FKBP12 and this complex inhibits TOR activity ( Sormani  et al.  2007 ). In early studies of plants, rapamycin insensitivity was explained in part due to the finding that none of the FKBP homologues in  Arabidopsis  were able to form a ternary complex with TOR in the presence of rapamycin ( Mahfouz  et al.  2006 ;  Sormani  et al.  2007 ). Although this result suggested that rapamycin does not affect TOR function in plants, in the unicellular green alga  Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  TOR and FKBP12 homologues have been identified and characterized, and  Chlamydomonas  cells are sensitive to rapamycin ( Crespo  et al.  2005 ). Recently, by analysis of site-specific phosphorylation of  Arabidopsis  S6Ks, a key substrate and mediator of TOR and a sensitive molecular and biochemical marker of endogenous TOR PK activity, it was found that rapamycin does effectively inhibit TOR protein kinase activation by glucose ( Xiong and Sheen 2012 ). The two blocks of HEAT motifs at the N-terminus of TOR enable it to interact with Regulatory-Associated Protein of TOR (RAPTOR). Regulatory-Associated Protein of TOR in turn enlists TOR kinase substrates ( Andrade and Bork 1995 ). A TOR-regulated pathway controls growth via regulation of translation through the TOR substrate ribosomal p70 S6 kinase ( Dufner and Thomas 1999 ). In  Arabidopsis , RAPTOR1 interacts with TOR (through the HEAT repeats) as well as S6K1, and the activity of S6K1 is affected by osmotic stress. Ectopic expressions of both  AtRAPTOR1  and  AtS6K1  in tobacco ( N. tabacum ) render the plant's osmotic stress insensitive; this indicates that the inhibition of S6K1 in plants under osmotic stress is under the control of TOR ( Mahfouz  et al.  2006 ). Similarly, TOR inactivation leads to a nutrient-starvation response, suggesting that TOR is involved in the response to nutrient deficiency ( Barbet  et al.  1996 ). Down-regulation of TOR by RNAi reduces organ growth and causes early senescence and transcriptomic and metabolomic perturbations, and sugar and amino acid accumulation. Moreover, plants overexpressing  TOR  accumulate more biomass and are more resistant to metabolic and osmotic stress ( Dobrenel  et al.  2011 ), and the level expression of  TOR  correlates inversely with the length of the primary root under salt concentrations. Conversely, constitutive expression of  TOR  alleviates the detrimental effect of osmotic stress ( Deprost  et al.  2007 ). Many more studies of  TOR  and its partners have been performed in other eukaryotes than in plants, but the work has burgeoned in recent years. The available data situate TOR kinase as a prominent link between environmental constraints and plant responses.  As has been exemplified in the previous sections, master regulators in plants are key components in the processes of stress sensing, signal transduction, response signal integration, gene expression remodelling, energetic and metabolic status tuning, and modification of development and growth patterns. All these processes demand energy and generally have a metabolic cost and, therefore, are fully activated only when cells are under biotic or abiotic stress ( Santos  et al.  2011 ;  Atkinson and Urwin 2012 ). Cells employ a wide variety of control checkpoints in order to regulate which defence mechanisms are activated in order to surpass the adverse conditions and which mechanisms are deactivated or remain down-regulated. Importantly, these regulatory molecules are responsible for rapid and efficient activation of defence mechanisms that will lead the plant to adaptation. Nearly every organism, from bacteria to multicellular eukaryotes, have sensory systems that allow measuring environmental cues; in other words, encoded in genotypes is the ability to produce distinct phenotypes determined by the variations in the environment ( Pigliucci 2005 ). Thus it is rational that some of the stress-responsive regulatory networks and their master regulators are present in different organisms, and work under similar mechanisms as observed in plants to promote acclimation to the stressing conditions.  The SNF1s/SNF1-related kinases/AMPKs are evolutionarily conserved sensors and master regulators of the energetic and metabolic states of the cell. These conserved regulators are found in all eukaryotic organisms from simple unicellular fungi (yeast SNF1) to roundworms (AMP-activated kinase), insects (AMPK), plants (SnRK1) and animals (AMPK) and are the decisive regulators of the gene expression in response to energy or nutrient depletion-stressing conditions and, in some instances, are regulators of the activity of key metabolic enzymes ( Polge and Thomas 2007 ). In general, these protein kinases function as heterotrimeric complexes that require a catalytic α-subunit and regulatory β- and γ-subunits for their structural stability and kinase activity. The number of complexes that can be formed varies significantly between organisms. For example, humans express several isoforms of each subunit that form AMPK: two α-subunits, two β-subunits and three isoforms of the γ-subunit. All variants are encoded by different genes; this diversity means that 12 different heterotrimeric complexes can be formed ( Hardie 2011 ).  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  encodes one catalytic α-subunit ( Snf1 ), three β-subunits ( Gal83, Sip1  and  Sip2 ) and a single γ-subunit ( Snf4 ) ( Celenza  et al.  1989 ). In plants, as previously described, SnRK kinases are grouped into three subfamilies: SnRK1, SnRK2 and SnRK3. The SnRK1 subfamily members have structural organization similar to AMPK and Snf1. The SnRK2 and SnRK3 subfamilies show some degree of sequence similarity to the catalytic α-subunits from yeast and mammals, but they do not functionally complement the yeast  snf1  deletion mutant ( Hrabak  et al.  2003 ). Despite this, the different subunits show remarkable evolutionary cross-species conservation at the sequence level. In the α-subunits, catalytic activity requires phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue: Thr210 in SNF1, Thr172 in AMPK and Thr175 in SnRK1.1/KIN10 ( Polge and Thomas 2007 ;  Ghillebert  et al.  2011 ). The amino acid sequences of the α-subunits from SNF1, AMPK and SnRK1 have 48 % identity overall, a percentage that rises to 60–65 % in the kinase domain. This noteworthy conservation among species indicates that an ancient kinase complex might have appeared 1.5 billion years ago, the estimated time when fungi, plants and mammalian kingdoms diverged. This also suggests that the complex originally evolved as a mechanism to regulate energy and carbon metabolism and response to starvation ( Hardie 2007 ;  Polge and Thomas 2007 ).  Interestingly, not only structural and regulatory aspects are shared among AMPK/SNF1/SnRK1 kinases but also the mechanism of enzyme activity and gene transcription control. Like the mechanism of SnRK activities in plants during stress discussed above, in mammals AMPK maintains cellular energy homoeostasis by regulating metabolic processes and responses to variable environments and energetic and metabolic stresses. AMP-activated protein kinase triggers catabolic pathways that produce ATP ( Marsin  et al . 2002 ;  Tomas  et al . 2002 ;  van Oort  et al . 2009 ;  Wu and Wei 2012 ) and in parallel inhibits several anabolic processes via direct phosphorylation of key metabolic enzymes ( Carling and Hardie 1989 ;  Hardie and Pan 2002 ;  Wakil and Abu-Elheiga 2009 ;  Bultot  et al.  2012 ), ensuring that general metabolism proceeds in accordance with nutrient availability and the cellular energy status ( Hoppe  et al.  2009 ). In addition to direct regulation of key metabolic enzymes, AMPK activates transcription of several genes involved in cellular adaptation to stress by modulating the activity of TFs ( Li  et al . 2011 ) and co-activators ( Bungard  et al.  2010 ;  Hardie 2011 ;  Mihaylova and Shaw 2011 ). The  S. cerevisiae  AMPK orthologue, SNF1 protein kinase, exerts very similar activities as a master regulator of the energy homoeostasis in yeast ( Sanz 2003 ). SNF1 senses nutrient and energy starvation stress and through positive or negative regulation of gene expression and phosphorylation of TFs, and key metabolic enzymes activates metabolic processes to produce ATP coupled to inhibition of energy-expensive biosynthetic processes ( Woods  et al.  1994 ). SNF1 regulates the transcription of a large set of genes including those involved in the metabolism of alternative carbon sources, gluconeogenesis, respiration, transport and meiosis ( Hedbacker and Carlson 2008 ). SNF1 catalytic activity also increases in response to a variety of stressors such as sodium ion stress, oxidative stress, alkaline pH, treatment with antimycin A (respiratory chain inhibitor) ( Hong and Carlson 2007 ), nitrogen limitation ( Orlova  et al.  2006 ) and heat stress ( Hahn and Thiele 2004 ). These regulatory roles emphasize the key participation of AMPK and SNF1 kinases in promoting protective actions and processes that confer maximal stress tolerance in eukaryotic life forms.  In contrast to SNF1/SnRK1/AMPK kinases that are activated by a decrement in the cellular energetic status, TOR kinase is activated by favourable and nutrient-rich conditions. The TOR signalling pathway transmits this information of wellness to the machinery of various energy-consuming processes such as mRNA translation, protein synthesis and cell proliferation.  In yeast and animals, there are two TOR complexes: TORC1, which contains three major proteins (TOR1 or TOR2, KOG1/RAPTOR and GbetaL/LST8) and TORC2, which is composed of TOR2, LST8/GbetaL and SIN1/RICTOR. These conserved components of the TORC1 complex are found in plants ( Inoki and Guan 2006 ). Target of rapamycin is a vital protein, as inhibition of  TOR  expression results in early embryonic death in  Drosophila melanogaster  ( Zhang  et al . 2000 ),  Caenorhabditis elegans  ( Long  et al.  2002 ), mice ( Gangloff  et al.  2004 ) and  Arabidopsis  ( Menand  et al.  2002 ). In yeast and mammalian cells, TOR signalling regulates numerous biological processes including ribosomal biogenesis, protein translation, cell size regulation and cell proliferation ( Chen  et al . 2012 a  ;  Davie and Petersen 2012 ).  Since TOR controls cell growth by integrating nutrient and environmental information, it is reasonable that unfavourable growth conditions regulate the TOR activity. In yeast, TORC1 activity is down-regulated in response to carbon, nitrogen or phosphate starvation and in response to high salinity, high temperatures and oxidative stress ( Loewith and Hall 2011 ). Studies in  Drosophila  and mammalian cells have shown that TOR signalling is inhibited under hypoxic stress. Hypoxia up-regulates the expression of  REDD1  and  REDD2  (Scylla and Charybdis in  Drosophila ), proteins that act downstream of Akt, an activator of TORC1 ( Brugarolas  et al.  2004 ;  Reiling and Hafen 2004 ;  Miyazaki and Esser 2009 ). DNA damage and redox stress also down-regulate TOR signalling ( Feng  et al.  2005 ;  Sarbassov and Sabatini 2005 ;  Feng 2010 ). Genotoxic stress inhibits Sestrin1 and Sestrin2 (transcriptional targets of the DNA damage sensor p53) and activates AMPK, thereby inhibiting TOR pathway activity ( Budanov and Karin 2008 ). Inactivation of mammalian TOR (mTOR) by RNA interference in HeLa cell culture drastically reduces the synthesis of heat shock proteins, suggesting a key role for mTORC1 in transcriptional responses to proteotoxic stress ( Chou  et al.  2012 ). RNA-microarray analysis of the transcriptome of HEK293 cells (embryonic kidney cells) exposed to moderate hypertonicity showed that mTOR regulates the transcription of osmostress response genes, revealing a previously unappreciated role of mTOR in regulating transcriptional mechanisms that control gene expression during cellular stress responses in human cells ( Ortells  et al.  2012 ). In  A. thaliana  grown in the presence of nitrate excess, the overexpression of  AtTOR  causes an increment in the primary root in comparison with the control, relieving the inhibition caused by nitrogen excess. Similar results were observed in the primary roots of overexpressing plants under osmotic stress ( Deprost  et al.  2007 ).  The existence of TOR signalling pathways in all eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms, from unicellular green algae to animals and land plants, is now indisputable. A recent phylogenetic analysis of the TOR pathway revealed that the two TOR complexes and most TOR pathway components originated prior to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor and that some accessory inputs were incorporated during evolution. These features reinforce the idea of  van Dam  et al.  (2011)  in relation to the fact that this is a vital pathway, highly conserved and flexible, capable of adapting to fulfil the changing needs of growth and development.  In higher eukaryotes, the tight regulation of the expression of several hundreds of genes is achieved through a variety of sequence-specific TFs. Differential engagement of the RNA PolII initiation machinery to gene promoters is crucial to control the transcription. Polymerase II is capable of relaxing and rewinding the DNA; however, PolII by itself is incapable of recognizing promoters and initiating transcription. For that a large pre-initiation complex (PIC) is required. The PIC is composed of more than 60 proteins including several general TFs. The large multisubunit Mediator complex is responsible for bridging diverse DNA-bound transcriptional regulators to the RNA PolII initiation machinery ( Kornberg 2007 ). Mediator facilitates PolII recruitment and enhances the formation of the PIC by facilitating the assembly of an enhancer/core promoter loop complex containing activators, general TFs, PolII and cohesions. Mediator then enhances the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of PolII via the general TF TFIIH. The Mediator complex also regulates the release of hindered PolII, enhances the re-initiation and coordinates RNA capping, splicing and polyadenylation ( Borggrefe and Yue 2011 ).  As a master integrator of regulatory signals, Mediator has a key role in the transcription of stress-responsive genes, and several subunits are responsible for activation of stress-specific signalling pathways in plants, fungi and mammals. The Srb11/Ssn8 cyclin subunit of the Mediator Kinase domain of human, plant and fungal pathogens ( Cryptococcus neoformans ,  Candida albicans ,  Fusarium verticillioides  and  Fusarium gramineaurum ) participates in the regulation of a general stress response by means of repressing nutrient responsive functions and transcription of genes related to the production of toxins and pigments, and controlling the cell wall integrity ( Shim and Woloshuk 2001 ;  Enjalbert  et al . 2003 ;  Zhou  et al . 2010 ;  Wang  et al . 2011 ). Elimination of the Med32 subunit in  S. cerevisiae  and  Schizosaccharomyces pombe  results in phenotypes with increased sensitivity to oxidative and salt stress and ethanol ( Linder  et al.  2008 ;  Koschubs  et al.  2009 ). Elimination of the Med32 subunit in  C. albicans  causes the same stress-sensitive phenotypes, indicating conservative roles. Interestingly, the elimination of Med32 revealed the additional roles of this subunit in the transcription of virulence-related genes with significant impact on the  ALS  adhesins ( Uwamahoro  et al.  2012 ). These results indicate that the Mediator complex is a decisive player in virulence, filamentation and biofilm formation in fungus species.  The Mediator complex is generally known as a co-activator; however, the Mediator complex also acts as a negative regulator of transcription. Thus, the Mediator complex can act as a co-activator, co-repressor and general TF ( Kornberg 2007 ). This set of features was decisive during the evolutionary diversification in eukaryotes. A recent comparative genomic analysis of Mediator subunits from 70 eukaryotes, including parasitic protists, diatoms, oomycetes, amoebae, green and red algae, land plants, fungi and animals, led to interesting conclusions on its evolutionary origin. The analysis showed that all yeast Mediator subunits have structural counterparts in insects and animals and allowed the identification of a set of core subunits that are traceable in most eukaryotic taxa. Interestingly, no Mediator subunit is specific to animals. All these data indicate the existence of an ancient four-module Mediator complex that appeared early in eukaryotic evolution ( Bourbon 2008 ). The high interspecies conservation observed for these molecular subunits assembled in a dynamic complex (Mediator complex) involved in signalling pathways, with prominent regulatory functions of gene expression, noteworthy implied in response to stress, explains and supports sufficiently their early evolutionary appearance and preservation in eukaryotes.  All organisms have mechanisms to repair damaged structures, scavenge toxic species and produce protective molecules (compatible solutes) and protein stabilizers (chaperones), among many other processes that alleviate alterations in cellular energy, metabolism and cell division. It is no surprise that the main signalling pathways that regulate cell growth, metabolism, senescence and apoptosis under normal conditions also regulate the stress responses. Harmonized regulation of the expression of the entire battery of genes related to stress responses and defence activities is successfully achieved commonly by the action of master regulators. The master regulators Mediator, NPR1, SnRK1 and TOR act as hubs to ensure that cellular resources are optimized. These factors play central regulatory roles in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses and are also important in signalling pathways active during normal growth. Possibly the best understood of these plant master regulators is Mediator, a protein complex in plants that is composed of at least 34 subunits that interact dynamically, offering in the organism a wide variety of options for the assortment of elements involved in the co-activation of gene transcription in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. This macromolecule assembly exemplifies how plants (and other organisms) have evolved to respond efficiently to changes in the environment by integrating several pathways through key master regulators.  Despite broad knowledge of the genes positively and negatively regulated by master regulators, the intricate networks of gene transcription regulation in response to stressors are still not completely understood. Integrative approaches are required in order to elucidate all the possible interactions among stress signals, master transcriptional regulators, TFs (activators and repressors), responsive genes and crosstalk between different stress signals. Systems biology approaches are proving to be of much help in the study and elucidation of complex regulatory networks as these approaches integrate theory, omics data and mathematical models. It is becoming possible to obtain an integrative image of the cellular status at different levels of organization: transcriptional, proteomic, metabolic and even interactomic. This high degree of integration allows a deeper understanding of complex processes and the reconstruction of networks with the possibility for characterization and quantification of the relationship of the genotype to the phenotype. Systems biology and omics approaches have been used to elucidate some key regulatory pathways and their components in plant responses to abiotic stress ( Hirai  et al.  2004 ;  Cramer  et al.  2011 ;  Weckwerth 2011 ;  Obata and Fernie 2012 ). For example, a recent data warehouse for maize called OPTIMA-DW ( http://www.optimas-bioenergy.org/optimas_dw ) has been created. This system biology project is a comprehensive compendium of transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and ionomic analyses from maize grown under a large set of controlled stress conditions (drought, cold, nutrient deficit) or developmental stages ( Colmsee  et al.  2012 ).  Identification of participants in the different interactome-stress networks will help us to discover key regulatory targets susceptible to modification, opening the possibility for design of integral strategies for crop improvement. Genes targeted for modification must be stress-responsive elements and adjustment of expression must confer some degree of adaptation to adverse conditions. An important characteristic is that the activity of target genes must not result in an energetic or metabolic cost that will affect growth under non-stressing conditions. Modification of the activity of master regulators is a promising strategy for plant stress improvement that should increase the plasticity of the plant responses and adaptation as many genes and enzymes are under their control. However, to avoid adverse side-effects, such as metabolic burden, energy exhaustion or overall poor growth performance under non-stressing conditions, modification of master regulator activities must be carefully tuned. Another strategy is to modify the activity of general repressors that negatively modulate the transcription of a wide range of genes. This strategy will modify the expression of a specific set of genes that impact the response towards a stressor without the need to modifying all activities of master regulators. This strategy could also be applied to TFs associated with the signalling pathways controlled by master regulators to up-regulate the expression of certain genes.  It will also be important to elucidate the crosstalk between signalling pathways and identify master regulators that are active nodes during different stressing conditions. A genome-scale regulatory model of the  Arabidopsis  genome predicted that 10 TFs are the most influential regulatory hubs (these are  KAN3 ,  AP2 ,  ANAC036 ,  KAN ,  AtTLP3 ,  AGL46 ,  MYB29 ,  PHD finger ,  AETRF1/ERF1  and  MYB121 ). Twelve gene subnetworks that have high clustering coefficients were identified, indicating high normalized indices of connectivity between the genes involved in the subnetwork. Interestingly, four of these subnetworks are involved in biotic and abiotic stresses (response to other organisms, response to heat, SAR, response to salt stress and immune response), suggesting that  A. thaliana  has evolved regulatory networks with high connectivity as a way to respond efficiently and dynamically to changing environments ( Carrera  et al.  2009 ). Future work will help in the identification and resolution of a core regulatory module in plants such as that already identified in yeast using a system-level analysis ( Kim  et al . 2012 ). Using the regulatory information from experimentally identified signalling and transcriptional networks in yeast, a global regulatory network was constructed with a stringent cutoff. From this, a core regulatory module was identified that interconnects different stress-responsive subregulatory networks. The core acts as an information processor on which all the environmental signals converge, and these signals are efficiently interpreted and common stress responses can be induced. This type of integrative study will increase our knowledge of how cells respond to numerous stressors with a minimum number of internal molecular components.
