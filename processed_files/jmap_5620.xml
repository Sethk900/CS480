Do male tree frogs feed during the breeding season? Stomach flushing of five syntopic hylid species in Rio Grande do Sul, BrazilThe diet of males of five syntopic hylid species from the Araucaria plateau of Rio Grande do Sul was studied by stomach flushing. Because the duration of their breeding seasons was rather different, the levels of food intake at the respective breeding sites were analysed. We found a positive correlation between the length of the male calling period and the ingestion of prey. The longer the speciesâ€specific reproductive activity of the males, the more individuals fed during that time. The results are discussed under congruence aspects of feeding and mating microhabitats in these tree frogs. In addition, differences in niche breadth may influence the temporal and spatial partitioning between the species studied and result in quantitative as well as qualitative patterns of prey consumption, thereby ensuring a maximum of fitness gain. 1.
