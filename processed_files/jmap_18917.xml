Soil respiration responses to temperature are controlled more by roots than by decomposition in balsam fir ecosystemsConcern exists that soil respiration (R-s) will increase with global warming, thereby reducing the sink strength of forest ecosystems for carbon (C) or making them sources. We measured R-s at three balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) sites on a climatic gradient from 1997 to 2000 to assess potential responses to global warming. Mean annual R-s varied from 0.67 kg C.m(-2).year(-1) at the cool site, to 1.19 kg C.m(-2).year(-1) at the midtransect site, to 1.52 kg C.m(-2).year(-1) at the warm site. Trenched plots were installed in 1999 to partition R-s into root respiration (R-r) and heterotrophic respiration (R-h). Differences in trenched-plot respiration (R-t) among sites were much less than differences in R-s, because trenching reduced R-s at the warm site more than at the cool site. Annual R-t was 22% less than annual R-s at the cool site, 36% less at the midtransect site, and 50% less at the warm site. After making adjustments for extraordinary decomposition of killed roots in trenched plots, it was estimated that annual R-h varied little among sites (0.40 kg C.m(-2).year(-1) at the cool site to 0.54 kg C.m(-2).year(-1) at the warm site), but annual R-r varied substantially among sites (0.24 kg C.m(-2).year(-1) at the cool site to 0.98 kg C.m(-2).year(-1) at the warm site). We conclude that R-s varied among sites, because climatically driven differences in primary productivity caused greater R-r and greater detrital production for R-h.
