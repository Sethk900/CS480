Impact of Water-Sediment Exchange on Underwater Terrain Shaping Process for a Tide-Influenced Waterfront LakeAbstractThis study selected a typical waterfront lake, the Inner Lake, as the research area. Based on field measurements and laboratory experiments, the basic properties of sediment particles were analyzed, including size, bulk and dry bulk density, and hydrostatic and hydrodynamic settling velocity. With the finite-volume method, the flux vector splitting (FVS) scheme was employed to establish a two-dimensional unsteady flow and sediment mathematical model. The underwater terrain shaping processes in the short term (2017), middle term (2020), and long term (2025) were predicted. The results showed that sediment deposition thickness will significantly increase in the Inner Lake, reaching 13.5 cm in the short term (January 2017), 28.6 cm in the middle term (January 2020), and 55.2 cm in the long term (January 2025). Owing to the strong hydrodynamic condition of the Leading Channel, sediment deposition there is the lowest, with the lake bed elevating rate at 3.92  cm·a−1 on average. The elevating rate at the northern bottomland and the southern bottomland is 54.3% higher than at the Leading Channel because of the reduction of sediment carrying capacity, and it is at a middle level at Jiaonan Gate because of the backwater effect of the tide. The average elevating rate of the whole lake is 4.50  cm·a−1 in the short term, 5.03  cm·a−1 in the middle term, and 5.32  cm·a−1 in the long term. The increase in average elevating rate indicates that sediment deposition will further affect hydrodynamic conditions and thereby accelerate the lake bed elevating process.
