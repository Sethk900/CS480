Effect of Suspended Solids on the Sequential Disinfection of Secondary Effluent by UV Irradiation and ChlorinationAbstractThe synergistic effects of sequential ultraviolet (UV) radiation and chlorination on tailing during disinfection of Escherichia coli in secondary effluent were investigated. To accomplish this, the effects of UV and chlorination, pH, dose of chlorine and dose of UV on kinetic curves of E. coli were evaluated. Total suspended solids (TSS) were found to be responsible for tailing during disinfection, and their concentrations were linearly correlated with the overall inactivation rate. Specifically, inactivation decreased by 10 times as suspended solids increased from 6 to 85  mg/L. The synergistic effects of sequential UV radiation and chlorination were identified. Sequential UV radiation and chlorination substantially increased the inactivation rate by 1.08–1.25 times in the first-order region and increased the log-inactivation value by 2–2.5 times in the tailing region with respect to chlorination. Reducing pH and/or increasing chlorine and UV dose magnified the enhancements of the first-order inactivation rate and reduced the time at which the tailing region started.
