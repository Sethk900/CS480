Amerozercon Halašková, 1969 species (Acari: Mesostigmata: Zerconidae) of the United States of AmericaDuring the study of rich material collected in the USA, six Zerconidae species were found which seem to belong to the genus Amerozercon Halašková, 1969. Four of them, Amerozercon annularis sp. nov., Amerozercon auricularis sp. nov., Amerozercon halaskovae sp. nov. and Amerozercon penicillatus sp. nov. proved to be new to science. The unknown female of the type species of the genus, Amerozercon suspiciosus Halašková, 1969, is described. Amerozercon minimus (Sellnick, 1958) is redescribed and transferred from the genus Zercon C. L. Koch, 1836 to Amerozercon. Some remarks on the problems of the present Zerconidae systematics are discussed.
