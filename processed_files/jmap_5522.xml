Protozoan ciliate epibionts on the freshwater apple snail Pomacea figulina (Spix, 1827) (Gastropoda, Ampullariidae) in an urban stream of southâ€east BrazilThe objective of this study was to record and analyze the prevalence of ciliated protozoa associated with prosobranchian snails of the species Pomacea figulina collected from an urban stream in southâ€eastern Brazil. Four collections were carried out between December, 2005, and March, 2006, from which 23 snails and 10 â€˜emptyâ€™ shells were obtained. The shells and opercula were scraped over Petri dishes and the ciliates were observed using bright field and phase contrast microscopy. Seven species of ciliates were recorded on the snails of P. figulina. Of the 23 snails analyzed, 82.60% (nÂ =Â 19) were infested with at least one species of ciliate. No ciliates were found on the â€˜emptyâ€™ shells and opercula. The results are discussed in terms of ecological aspects involved in this association.
