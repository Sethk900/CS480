Reproductive biology of Opuntia: A reviewA review of the reproductive biology of fleshy-fruited species of Opuntia sensu stricto was conducted. Among Cactaceae, Opuntia is the most diverse and widely distributed genus in the Americas. The genus is strongly associated with bee pollination and coevolution with at least two bee genera is Suggested. Fruits and vegetative parts, Such as spiny cladodes, are closely linked with seed dispersal and highly efficient vegetative dissemination by animals. Vegetative multiplication appears to be more efficient than sexual reproduction for plant recruitment. Both sexual reproduction and plant multiplication seem to have contributed to the ecological and evolutionary success of the genus, but empirical evidence is lacking. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
