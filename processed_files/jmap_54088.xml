Leaf litter quality induces morphological and developmental changes in larval amphibiansAquatic consumers exhibit many types of inducible phenotypic responses to variation in resource quantity and quality. Leaf litter constitutes a primary resource in freshwater systems, and variation in litter quality can alter the growth and development of aquatic consumers. It is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that variation in litter quality might also induce phenotypic changes in consumers. To test this hypothesis, we exposed two densities of wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus [Rana sylvatica]) tadpoles to six chemically distinct species of leaf litter from temperate broadleaf and coniferous trees. After several weeks, we quantified development rate, growth rate, intestinal length, size of the oral disc, and five external dimensions of the tadpoles. In addition to substantial changes in growth and development rates, we found striking changes in all morphological responses among different leaf litter environments, including up to 14% longer intestines, 11% deeper tails, and 6% deeper tail muscles. In addition, we found strong relationships of total nitrogen content with all morphological features except growth rate. Our results indicate that differences in resource quality can induce phenotypic changes that are as large as or larger than changes induced by resource quantity. Our study also has substantial implications for the future of aquatic consumers living in forested wetlands given that these forests are currently experiencing widespread changes in tree composition.
