The invertebrate Fauna associated with intertidal beds of the brown mussel Perna perita (L.) from Santos, BrazilThe present study represents a seasonal examination of two mussel beds subjected to different degrees of wave exposure at Una das Palmas (Bay of Santos, Brazil). This research evaluates the influence of several abiotic factors on the spatial arrangement of mussel beds, as well as effects of mussel bed structure on the composition of its associated fauna. Material, in sample areas of 100 cm2, was removed from the upper and lower levels of both beds, in winter and summer, during low and high tides. Density and biomass of the principal invertebrate groups were quantified. Similarity between samples was checked through cluster analysis based on Czekanowski and Morisita indices. Low water motion favoured sediment deposition in the protected station, producing a suitable substrate for the establishment of infauna. Epifauna and nestling species were dominant at the exposed station, which retained almost no sediment. Crustaceans, particularly Amphipoda, were numerically dominant at both sites, although Gastropoda and Polychaeta were also important components of the community at the protected site. It was found that wave exposure is the main factor affecting both the spatial complexity of mussel beds and composition of the associated fauna.
