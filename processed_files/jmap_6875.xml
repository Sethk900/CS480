Infection by Contracaecum rudolphii (Nematoda: Anisakidae) in the Neotropic cormorant Phalacrocorax brasilianus, and fishes from the estuary of the Valdivia river, ChileSeasonal parameters of infection by the nematode Contracaecum rudolphii in the Neotropic cormorant Phalacrocorax brasilianus (Phalacrocoracidae) and their relation with feeding and infection in fishes from River Valdivia, Chile, were determined. The prevalences of infection in birds were similar during seasons, whereas mean intensity and percentages of adult gravid females were higher in spring and summer, respectively. For fishes no seasonal differences were found in infection. Cormorant diet varied seasonally in relation to fish prey consumed and this can be related to seasonal differences in infection parameters of birds. The high infection in birds should be considered as a potential risk for salmoniculture.
