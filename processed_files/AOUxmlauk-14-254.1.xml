Nuestro trabajo reciente sobre   Myiopsitta monachus   present&oacute; valores incorrectos de pendiente de dominancia debido a un error en el programa de an&aacute;lisis.

Palabras clave:  jerarqu&iacute;a de dominancia, pendiente, SOCPROG  The dominance steepness results for captive Monk Parakeets ( Myiopsitta monachus ) we reported ( Hobson et al. 2014 ) were inaccurate because of a bug in the program we used for dominance hierarchy analyses. SOCPROG version 2.4 ( Whitehead 2009 ) had an error in how steepness was calculated (H. Whitehead personal communication). We reanalyzed aggression for our captive Monk Parakeet groups using the R package &lsquo;steepness' ( Leiva and de Vries 2014 ; 10,000 permutations). Dominance linearity was consistent with our originally published values. Steepness values are more moderate than previously reported ( Table 1 ; steepness values replace those in  Hobson et al. 2014 : table 4). The  D ij   steepness values are no longer on the extremely egalitarian end of the egalitarian&ndash;despotic continuum as previously reported ( Hobson et al. 2014 : figure 8). Rather, the updated values are now moderate for both captive groups, putting both groups in the middle of this continuum ( Figure 1 ). Because captive conditions are likely to increase the chances of a steeper hierarchy ( Stevens et al. 2007 ), dominance hierarchies for Monk Parakeets in the wild are still likely to be less steep, and more egalitarian, than those observed in captivity ( Hobson et al. 2014 ).  Dominance steepness across species. Dominance steepness ( D ij  ) measures are reported for wild and captive adult groups, with species ordered by mean reported steepness values.

Steepness values for adult   Lama guanicoe   ( Correa et al. 2013 ) that were reported in  Hobson et al. (2014)  were omitted from this revised version because that study reported using SOCPROG version 2.4 to calculate steepness.  Corrected dominance steepness values for captive groups 1 and 2.  Thanks to C. Neumann for his reanalysis of our data that alerted us to the presence of a bug in SOCPROG 2.4, and to H. Whitehead for confirming the bug. The newly released SOCPROG 2.5 has corrected this bug.
