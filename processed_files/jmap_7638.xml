Caenis cuniana sp. n., a Parthenogenetic MayflyAbstract Caenis cuniana n. sp. is described. Females, soon after the imaginai moult, are ready for oviposition. The number of eggs laid varied usually between 100 and 300. The time required for hatching varied from 7 to 29 days; hatching of eggs from a single oviposition extended over several days. The nymphs required on an average 71 days from hatching to emergence. 4â€“7 minutes after emergence of the subimago the imaginai moult took place. The active life of adults lasted about 2 hours. Emergence took place all the year round. Nymphs live in shallow water, even in shallow marshes where the temperature fluctuates widely.
