A new species of Micropterix Hübner, 1825 from the Orobian Alps (Italy) (Lepidoptera, Micropterigidae)Micropterix gaudiella Zeller & Huemer, sp. n. is described from the southern part of the Orobian Alps (Piedmont, Italy) and compared with its likely closest relatives Micropterix isobasella Staudinger, 1871 and Micropterix stuebneri Zeller, Werno & Kurz, 2013. The new species is well characterized by its wing pattern and colour and by structures of the male genitalia. The species status is furthermore supported by molecular data of the DNA barcode region. The distance to its nearest neighbour Micropterix schaefferi Heath, 1975 is 2.65%. M. gaudiella is the seventh species of the genus Micropterix Hübner, 1825 probably endemic to the Alps.
