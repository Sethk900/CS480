Optimization Model for Planning Regional Water Resource Systems under UncertaintyAbstractThis study proposes an interval semiinfinite De Novo programming (ISIDP) method for the planning of water resource management systems under uncertainty. The ISIDP problem is settled by dividing it into two interactive linear programming subproblems and solving it by using a conventional simplex method. To evaluate the applicability of the proposed model, the method is applied to a case study of the Yuecheng Reservoir in Zhangweinan River Basin, China. The results indicate that the strategies generated through ISIDP would not increase the complexity in decision-making processes. Compared with the conventional optimization method, ISIDP has the advantages of (1) better reflecting the association of the system benefits with water price, (2) generating more reliable solutions with a lower risk of system failure as a result of the possible violation of constraints, and (3) providing more flexible management planning because the availability of budgets can be adjusted with the variations in water price.
