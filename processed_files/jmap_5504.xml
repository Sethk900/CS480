Observations on the spectral reflectances of certain high Andean Penaincisalia and Thecloxurina, with the description of a new species (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae: Eumaeini)The eumaeine hairstreak species Thecloxurina tegulina Bálint and Boyer, sp. n. from SW Peru, department Apurímac (type locality: Karkatera, NW of Ampay, 3,200 m, 13°34′286″S; 72°58′501″W) is described on the basis of qualitative and quantitative wing pattern, male genital and spectral characters. The spectral reflectance of the closely related genera Penaincisalia and Thecloxurina are investigated and compared. It is demonstrated that the spectral characteristics of the two genera are qualitatively differing, and the taxa investigated representing the two genera (Penaincisalia:Thecloxurina = 3:5) also have characteristic species dependent reflectance peaks measured at normal incidence.
