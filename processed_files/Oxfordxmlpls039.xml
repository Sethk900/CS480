Phenetic and phylogenetic methods together suggest that distinct geographic lineages exist within this taxon, which will be important for future conservation efforts.  The florist's gloxinia is a familiar houseplant in the Gesneriaceae, the botanical family that includes the African violet ( Saintpaulia ) and other ornamental species. The gloxinia's wild progenitor is  Sinningia speciosa  (Lodd.) Hiern, a Brazilian endemic. Although it has been cultivated for almost 200 years, little is known about the genetic diversity in  S. speciosa , how the wild populations relate to one another or even where the cultivated forms originated. Using available wild collections, preliminary phenetic and phylogenetic investigations were conducted to elucidate the interspecific relationships within  S. speciosa  and to infer the origins of the cultivars.  Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis was applied to 24 accessions of  S. speciosa  (17 wild collections, seven cultivars) and one accession each of  Sinningia guttata  and  Sinningia macrophylla . A maximum likelihood (ML) tree was also calculated from an alignment of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer sequence from the same 26 accessions.  Dice/UPGMA and principal coordinates analysis of the AFLP data partitioned  S. speciosa  into several distinct clusters, one of which included  S. macrophylla . All cultivated â€˜gloxiniasâ€™ grouped together in a major cluster with plants from Rio de Janeiro. The AFLP results were compared with a phylogenetic analysis of the ribosomal spacer region, which was informative in  S. speciosa . The ML tree generally supported the AFLP results, although several clades lacked strong statistical support.  Independent analyses of two different data sets show that  S. speciosa  is a diverse species comprised of several lineages. Genetic distance estimates calculated from the AFLP data were positively correlated with geographic distances between populations, indicating that reproductive isolation could be driving speciation in this taxon. Molecular markers are under development for population genetic studies in  S. speciosa , which will make it possible to define evolutionarily significant units for purposes of conservation.   The first known published image of  Gloxinia  ( Sinningia )  speciosa  from Volume I (third fascicle) of  The Botanical Cabinet , plate number 28, July 1817.  Illustration by George Loddiges (son of Conrad Loddiges), copper-plate engraving by George Cooke.  The first botanical descriptions of  S. speciosa  (as  G. speciosa ) were published in two British botanical periodicals in 1817; one was by John Sims, MD in  Curtis's Botanical Magazine  ( Sims 1817 ), and the other, in both Latin and English, is from  The Botanical Register  and is attributed to John B. Ker Gawler ( Edwards 1817 ). The designated type specimen for  S. speciosa  is held in the collection of the Conservatoire et Jardin Botanique de la Ville GenÃ¨ve (G) as specimen G00133692; the herbarium sheet is dated 23 June 1819, and the notation states that the plant was obtained from â€˜jard. de Loddiges a Hackneyâ€™ (  www.ville-ge.ch/musinfo/bd/cjb/chg/adetail.php?id=106139&amp;base=img&amp;lang=en  ). Modern descriptions of  S. speciosa  can be found in  Bailey (1917)  and  Moore (1957) , although neither mentions the perennial tuber.   Floral diversity in  S. speciosa  . The top row shows flowers of three wild forms: â€˜BÃºziosâ€™ from the Cabo Frio region of south-eastern Rio de Janeiro state (left), â€˜Pedra Lisaâ€™ from northern Rio de Janeiro state (centre) and â€˜SÃ£o Conradoâ€™ from the southern part of Rio de Janeiro city. The bottom row shows three cultivars with large peloric flowers in colours and patterns unknown in the wild.  The distribution of  S. speciosa  is restricted to the Atlantic coastal forests (Mata AtlÃ¢ntica) of south-eastern Brazil ( Araujo and Chautems 2010 ), an area recognized as one of 34 world biodiversity hotspots because of its high level of species richness and endemism ( Myers  et al . 2000 ;  Mittermeier  et al . 2004 ). The geographical range of  S. speciosa  encompasses âˆ¼4 Ã— 10 5  km 2  in EspÃ­rito Santo, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro states, and populations may also exist in SÃ£o Paulo, ParanÃ¡ and Santa Catarina states (A. Chautems, Conservatoire et Jardin Botaniques de la Ville de GenÃ¨ve, personal communication). Human activities such as agriculture (cattle ranching; sugarcane, eucalyptus and coffee plantations), mining, and expansion of the major cities of Rio de Janeiro and SÃ£o Paulo have greatly reduced the size of the southern coastal forests, threatening the genetic diversity of the plant and animal species that live there. Despite this loss of habitat, many natural populations of  S. speciosa  survive, and the species as a whole has retained considerable morphological diversity ( Zaitlin and Pierce 2010 ). Variation is readily observed in the leaves (size, shape, colour, indument), flowers (size, shape, number per axil), corolla (colour, shape, patterning), petal lobes (size, shape), calyx (size, shape) and stem (colour, internode length) [see  Additional Information ]. Past taxonomic treatments of  S. speciosa  have left us with a list of discarded synonyms for this diverse species encompassing 39 taxa in seven genera that included  Ligeria ,  Orthanthe ,  Orobanche  ( Skog and Boggan 2007 ) and  Martynia  ( Loiseleur-Deslongchamps 1820 ) in addition to  Gloxina  and  Sinningia .  The objective of the research presented here was to determine whether amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) are informative in  S. speciosa , and to test the hypothesis that they can be used for investigating genetic diversity within a group of wild and cultivated accessions. While the main goal of this preliminary study was to define the intraspecific relationships between plants collected from natural populations, seven domesticated cultivars were also included to shed some light on the geographical origins of the cultivated florist's gloxinia. Amplified fragment length polymorphism is a powerful and robust molecular marker technology that requires no prior knowledge of genome sequence, and is therefore potentially useful in non-model and genetically uncharacterized organisms. Amplified fragment length polymorphisms have been widely applied in studies of plant genetic diversity and evolution ( Sudupak  et al . 2004 ;  Spooner  et al . 2005 ;  Zerega  et al . 2005 ;  Allen  et al . 2008 ;  Azizi  et al . 2009 ;  Garrido  et al . 2012 ), genotyping and cultivar identification in ornamental and horticultural crops ( Chao  et al . 2005 ;  Parks  et al . 2006 ;  Krichen  et al . 2008 ;  Wu  et al . 2011 ), and as an aid in resolving species-level phylogenies when DNA sequence diversity is limited ( Beardsley  et al . 2003 ;  DesprÃ©s  et al . 2003 ;  Pelser  et al . 2003 ;  MereÄa  et al . 2008 ). In the present study, an analysis of fluorescent end-labelled AFLP fragments amplified from genomic DNA was used to infer genetic relationships within a group of  S. speciosa  accessions. Included were 15 wild collections of  S. speciosa  of known origin, two wild-type collections of unknown origin, seven â€˜gloxiniaâ€™ cultivars and two related species ( Sinningia guttata  and  Sinningia macrophylla ) as potential outgroups. The 26 plant accessions were clustered using phenetic (Dice/UPGMA) and principal coordinates analyses (PCoA) of the AFLP data. These results were compared with a phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (nrITS) region amplified and sequenced from the same 26  Sinningia  taxa. Taken together, the two independent analyses show that  S. speciosa  is a highly diverse taxon that may include  S. macrophylla , and that the  S. speciosa  cultivars appear to be most closely affiliated with plants collected from populations in or near the city of Rio de Janeiro.  The majority of plants used in this study were grown from seeds, with several exceptions as detailed below. Eight of the wild-collected  S. speciosa  accessions, as well as the cultivars â€˜Guataparaâ€™ and â€˜Dona Lourdesâ€™, were obtained as seeds from M. Peixoto (Mogi das Cruzes, SP, Brazil) and are described in  Zaitlin and Pierce (2010) . The wild  S. speciosa  collections â€˜Massaguassuâ€™ (from near a beach of that name in the municipality of Caraguatatuba in SP state) and â€˜CMâ€™ (unknown origin, possibly from Rio de Janeiro), and the cultivar â€˜Purpleâ€™ were also obtained from M. Peixoto. Wild-type  S. speciosa  accessions AC1503, â€˜Chiltern Seedsâ€™ and â€˜Reginaâ€™, and the peloric cultivar â€˜Red with Spotsâ€™ were purchased from the seed fund of the Gesneriad Society (  www.gesneriadsociety.org  ). Seeds of the peloric white-flowered cultivar â€˜Ken's Whiteâ€™ were obtained from the Gesneriad Hybridizer's Association. â€˜Avenida Niemeyerâ€™ was the kind gift of Wallace Wells of New York, NY; the original collection was made in August 1975 by Charles Marden Fitch on a rocky slope between the Sheraton Rio Hotel and the Hotel Nacional in Rio de Janeiro on the coastal road of this name.  Sinningia speciosa  â€˜SÃ£o Conradoâ€™ was collected in the same general area in 1999, several kilometres to the west, by Mr Tsuh Yang Chen of New York City, and was the gift of Dr William Price of Vancouver, BC, Canada. â€˜Kaiser Wilhelmâ€™, a classic â€˜gloxiniaâ€™ cultivar with peloric purple and white flowers, was obtained as a tuber from a commercial source. DNA of JFS4512, a peloric cultivar, was kindly provided by Dr James Smith of Boise State University ( Smith  et al . 2004 ).  Sinningia  seeds were routinely germinated in 10 cm pots containing Pro-Mix BX (Premier Horticulture Inc., Quakertown, PA, USA), and the seedlings were grown under fluorescent lighting (80 Âµmol m âˆ’2  s âˆ’1 ) at 25 Â°C until they were large enough to sample for DNA extraction.  Total plant DNA was extracted from small samples of leaf tissue (pooled from several plants of each accession) using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). DNA concentration was determined by absorbance at 260 nm using a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA).   DNA sequences of oligonucleotide primers used for AFLP analysis and amplification and sequencing of the nrITS region in  Sinningia .  Amplified fragment length polymorphism primers E32 (Eco + AAC) and E33 (Eco + AAG) were labelled at the 5â€² termini with WellRed dye D2.  DNA fragment peak sizes in the D2 channel were calculated against the standards in the D1 channel using the software supplied with the CEQ8000 instrument. The quartic equation gave the best approximation of a linear relationship between peak sizes (in nucleotides) vs. migration time with the 600 standard. Data peaks were machine scored (1 = present, 0 = absent) using the â€˜New AFLP Analysisâ€™ module (parameter settings: 10 % slope threshold, 10 % relative peak height threshold, 95 % confidence level, bin width = 1 bp, PA ver. 1 dye mobility calibration) and the data exported to Microsoft Excel. Every AFLP chromatogram was examined for the presence of unscored peaks at a minimum height threshold of 5000 fluorescence units. Data entries from poorly resolved and miscalled peaks were removed from the spreadsheets. Peaks well outside the standard size range (&lt;60 and &gt;640 bases) were also removed. Similarity matrices based on the Dice coefficient ( Dice 1945 ) were calculated from the binary AFLP data using the SIMQUAL module in the NTSYSpc 2.2 software package ( Rohlf 2009 ), and clustering was performed with the UPGMA (unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean) algorithm in the SAHN module. Goodness of fit of the UPGMA dendrogram to the Dice similarity matrix was assessed using the COPH and MXCOMP modules in NTSYSpc. Bootstrapping (BS) was also performed with NTSYSpc using the program modules RESAMPLE to generate 1000 resampled files of the AFLP data, SIMQUAL to calculate the similarity matrices and CONSENS (with MAJRUL selected) to compare the trees and calculate cluster frequencies. Principal coordinates analysis was performed on the AFLP data (imported in spreadsheet format) using the statistical software package MVSP 3.2 (Kovach Computing Services, Anglesey, UK) with the following program settings: data matrix transformed, Euclidean distances computed, eigenanalysis tolerance set to 10 âˆ’7 . The resulting graphs were exported as enhanced metafiles, and text labels were added with the program Metafile Companion (Companion Software, Sunderland, MA, USA).  Genetic distances (GDs) were calculated with NTSYSpc for the AFLP data (GD = 1âˆ’Dice's coefficient) and MEGA 5.03 ( Tamura  et al . 2011 ) for the nrITS DNA sequence data (Tamuraâ€“Nei substitution model), respectively. Geographic distances were calculated with the GPS Visualizer tool (  http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/calculators  ) based on GPS coordinates for Brazilian cities and towns kindly provided by A. Chautems.  Sinningia speciosa  â€˜JurapÃªâ€™ was named for the mountain in Santa Catarina state where it was allegedly collected, and coordinates for the nearest town (Joinville) are S26Â°18â€²16.2â€³, W48Â°50â€²55.248â€³ (âˆ’26.3045, âˆ’48.84868). Serra da Vista is a mountain âˆ¼20 km south of the town of Cardoso Moreira in Rio de Janeiro state. Coordinates used for this collection were S21Â°39â€²55.116â€³, W41Â°36â€²59.4â€³ (âˆ’21.66531, âˆ’41.6165). Mantel tests were performed with IBDWS (Isolation-by-Distance Web Service v.3.23;  Jensen  et al . 2005 ) to determine whether the GD matrix was significantly correlated with the geographic distance matrix. Ten thousand randomizations were used.  The internal transcribed spacer region of the 18Sâ€“26S nuclear rDNA repeat (nrITS) was amplified from  Sinningia  genomic DNA (10â€“20 ng) using primers ITS6 (this study; see TableÂ  1  for primer sequences) and ITS8m (modified from  MÃ¶ller and Cronk 1997 ) in 1Ã— FailSafe â€˜Aâ€™ premix (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI, USA) at a concentration of 1 ÂµM in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR; 30 cycles of 95 Â°C for 30 s, 56 Â°C for 60 s and 72 Â°C for 90 s, followed by one cycle of 72 Â°C for 5 min). ITS6 and ITS8m are complementary to conserved sequences at the 3â€²-end of the 18S rRNA gene and the 5â€²-end of the 26S rRNA gene (see fig.Â 1 of  Baldwin  et al . 1995 ) from  Sinningia , respectively. All nrITS gene fragments (âˆ¼850 bp) were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) to remove salts and unincorporated primers. Nucleotide sequencing was performed on an automated sequencing instrument (Beckman Coulter CEQ8000) with four passes (two per strand), using primers ITS5seq2 and ITS8m, both of which direct DNA strand synthesis from the fragment ends, and ITS2Gm and ITS3P, which are complementary to the ends of the 5.8S rDNA sequence, but are of opposite polarities ( MÃ¶ller and Cronk 1997 ). The nrITS regions from all  Sinningia  accessions reported here were sequenced at least twice, and the sequence tracings were carefully examined to resolve any possible conflicts or errors. The nrITS region from the cultivar â€˜Kaiser Wilhelmâ€™ proved to be polymorphic; the amplified fragment was therefore cloned into pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), and the inserts in several recombinant plasmids were sequenced with the same four primers.  Alignment of the nrITS region was performed manually using the program Se-Al v2.0a11 ( Rambaut 2007 ), which allowed the alignment to be exported and saved in FASTA format. Maximum likelihood analysis was performed on the  Sinningia  nrITS alignment with MEGA 5.03 for Mac OS X ( Tamura  et al . 2011 ), using the Tamuraâ€“Nei substitution model with gamma distribution (TN93 + G) to estimate rate variation across nucleotide sites. Reliability of the phylogenetic tree was estimated by BS with 1000 replications.   Number, sizes and relative polymorphism of AFLP markers amplified from  Sinningia  genomic DNA with four primer combinations.  In determining the number and per cent of mono- or polymorphic AFLP markers, â€˜all  Sinningia â€™ includes the wild and cultivated accessions of  S. speciosa  as well as one accession each of  S. guttata  and  S. macrophylla .   Dice/UPGMA tree showing phenetic relationships within a group of 24  S. speciosa  accessions (17 wild and seven cultivars) based on AFLP data . Two related species,  S. guttata  and  S. macrophylla , were also included in the analysis. Major clusters A and B are shown in pink and blue, respectively. Secondary clusters A1 and A2 are labelled at the appropriate nodes. Tertiary clusters A1-1, A1-2, A2-1, A2-2 and A2-3 are indicated by brackets. Bootstrap percentages &gt;50 % are shown adjacent to the cluster nodes.  To estimate the level of inherent error in the AFLP procedure, four independent AFLP amplifications were performed on DNA from  S. speciosa  â€˜Guataparaâ€™ that had been digested with EcoRI and MseI. Adaptor ligations, PSA reactions with primers E01 and M01, and SA reactions with primer pair E32M50 were carried out as described earlier ( Zhang  et al . 2012 ). Six replicates of each SA were then separated on the CEQ8000 instrument, and the data analysed as for the experimental samples. The E32M50 primer pair gave a total of 76 fragment bins between 67 and 570 nucleotides. This included three bins with only a single entry (unique peaks), which were removed from the analysis. Pair-wise similarities (simple matching) for the six within-group replicates were 0.945â€“0.986 (group 1), 0.959â€“0.973 (group 2), 0.973â€“1.00 (group 3) and 0.973â€“1.00 (group 4). This translates into error rates of 0â€“5.5 %, which is within the range cited by  Meudt and Clarke (2007)  for other plant AFLP studies. There were 17 peaks that were either present or absent for all entries within one or more replicate sets. Examination of the chromatograms revealed that this was due to minor between-run variances in the instrument scoring, which resulted in the peaks being placed in a new bin Â±1 nucleotide of the expected size, and was readily corrected.  Dice/UPGMA analysis of the AFLP data provided evidence of genetic diversity within  S. speciosa . Two major clusters were evident in the phenetic tree, with 20 of the 26 accessions present in cluster A (although there is a major division within this large cluster) (Fig.Â  3 ). The placement of â€˜Serra da Vistaâ€™ could imply the existence of a third cluster, although its position between clusters A and B makes its affiliations inconclusive. Cluster A1 consisted of three plants collected from Rio de Janeiro state (AC1503, â€˜Buziosâ€™ &amp; â€˜Cabo Frioâ€™), one plant from the southern part of Minas Gerais (â€˜Carangolaâ€™) and three plants from EspÃ­rito Santo state (â€˜Espirito Santoâ€™, â€˜Santa Teresaâ€™ and â€˜Domingos Martinsâ€™). Cluster A2 contained two plants from Rio de Janeiro (â€˜Avenida Niemeyerâ€™ and â€˜SÃ£o Conradoâ€™), the unidentified wild accession â€˜CMâ€™, and all of the domesticated varieties (â€˜Kaiser Wilhelmâ€™, â€˜Dona Lourdesâ€™, â€˜Guataparaâ€™, â€˜Purpleâ€™, JFS4512, â€˜Ken's Whiteâ€™ and â€˜Red with Spotsâ€™). Also in cluster A are two wild-type accessions of unknown geographical origins in A1 (â€˜Reginaâ€™ and â€˜Chiltern Seedsâ€™), and â€˜JurapÃªâ€™, an unconfirmed collection from Santa Catarina state, in A2. Cluster B contained one collection each from Rio de Janeiro and SÃ£o Paulo states (â€˜Cardoso Moreira-pinkâ€™ and â€˜Massaguassuâ€™, respectively), one from Minas Gerais (â€˜AntÃ´nio Diasâ€™), and  S. macrophylla  from Bahia.  Sinningia guttata  occupied a unique position in this analysis, and was an appropriate outgroup.   Principal coordinates analysis of  Sinningia  AFLP data . The relationships between 24 accessions of  S. speciosa  and single accession each of  S. guttata  and  S. macrophylla  are shown in two-dimensional scatterplots of (A) axes 1 vs. 2 and (B) axes 1 vs. 3. The circled groupings are labelled to show their affiliations with clusters in the Dice/UPGMA tree (Fig.Â  3 ).  Sinningia guttata  is shown in green,  S. macrophylla  in red, wild  S. speciosa  are in blue, and the cultivars are in black. Abbreviations used in cluster A2 are: Avenida Niemeyer (AN), SÃ£o Conrado (SC), â€˜Purpleâ€™ (â€˜Pâ€™), â€˜Dona Lourdesâ€™ (â€˜DLâ€™), â€˜Guataparaâ€™ (â€˜Gâ€™), â€˜Kaiser Wilhelmâ€™ â€˜(KWâ€™), JFS4512 (JFS) and â€˜Red with Spotsâ€™ (â€˜RwSâ€™). Eigenvalues for the first three PCO axes were 11.121, 8.883 and 7.803, respectively.   Isolation-by-distance (IBD) analysis for 12 wild collections of  S. speciosa  . Genetic distances were calculated from the AFLP data using NTSYSpc ( Rohlf 2009 ), and the geographic distances were calculated from GPS coordinates using the web-based GPS Visualizer tool (see the text). The Mantel test of significance and the IBD plot were calculated with IBDWS v. 3.23 ( Jensen  et al . 2005 ). In the linear regression, the equation for the line was  y  = 0.000642 x  + 0.3966, and  R  2  = 0.125. Three unverified  S. speciosa  accessions (â€˜CMâ€™, â€˜Massaguassuâ€™ and â€˜JurapÃªâ€™) were excluded from this analysis.   Features of the nrITS region from  Sinningia .  Internal transcribed spacer-specific fragments were amplified from genomic DNA isolated from 24 accessions of  S. speciosa  and one each of  S. guttata  and  S. macrophylla  using the primers ITS6 and ITS8m. The lengths of ITS1 and ITS2 were determined by comparison with sequences from carrot and broad bean ( Yokota  et al . 1989 ). Sequence analysis was performed with DnaSP v5 ( Librado and Rozas 2009 ). RNA secondary structure minimum free energies (Î” G ) were calculated individually for ITS1 and ITS2 from all nrITS sequences using the Mfold web server (  http://mfold.rna.albany.edu/  ) ( Zuker 2003 ).  The highest level of sequence divergence for the 27 nrITS sequences was 7.9 % between  S. speciosa  â€˜Carangolaâ€™ and  S. guttata . Within the group of 17 wild  S. speciosa  collections, divergence ranged from 0 to 4 % (TableÂ  3 ), which is comparable to levels of intraspecific nrITS divergence previously reported in angiosperms, e.g. 3.7 and 1.2â€“1.8 %, respectively, between subspecies of  Calycadenia truncata  ( Baldwin 1993 ) and  Caulanthus amplexicaulis  ( Pepper and Norwood 2001 ), 0â€“5.2 % between members of the  Streptanthus glandulosus  complex ( Mayer and Soltis 1999 ), 0.4â€“4.9 % within several populations of the Arctic endemic  Saxifraga cernua  ( Brochmann  et al . 1998 ) and an average of 2.4 % between European and North African populations of  Saxifraga globulifera  separated by the Straits of Gibraltar ( Vargas  et al . 1999 ). Higher levels of intraspecific nrITS divergence, up to 7.68 % for ITS1 + ITS2, have been reported for species of  Aeschynanthus  (Gesneriaceae;  Denduangboripant  et al . 2001 ), and could very well result from reduced rates of concerted evolution at the ribosomal repeat loci ( Denduangboripant and Cronk 2000 ).   Maximum likelihood tree calculated from the  Sinningia  nrITS DNA sequence alignment using MEGA5 . The tree with the highest log-likelihood (âˆ’ln  L  = 1482.93) is shown. Bootstrap percentages (1000 replicates) are shown adjacent to the nodes for all clades. All amplified nrITS fragments were sequenced directly with the exception of  S. speciosa  â€˜Kaiser Wilhelm', where the PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI). The sequences of two representative clones, KW-A and KW-C, were included in the ML analysis.  A Dice/UPGMA cluster analysis was performed on the  Sinningia  AFLP data matrix to uncover possible genetic structure within a group of 24 accessions of  S. speciosa . Included as outgroups were one accession each of  S. guttata  and  S. macrophylla , which are phylogenetically close to  S. speciosa  ( Perret  et al . 2003 ) and are the only species with which it will form fertile hybrids. Phenetic cluster analysis groups individuals or species based on presently existing shared characters, which in this case are genomic DNA fragments. Phenetics is distinguished from cladistics, which seeks to reconstruct evolutionary relationships from DNA sequence alignments.  Amplified fragment length polymorphism markers are anonymous DNA fragments that are amplified from loci distributed randomly throughout the genome. The individual fragmentsâ€”here detected as fluorescent peaksâ€”are coded as binary markers (1 = present, 0 = absent) and scored as independent unit characters of equal weight. The presence of the null allele (0) makes it impossible to distinguish between the allelic states 1/1 and 1/0 in most cases, and thus AFLPs mimic dominant morphological genetic markers. Amplified fragment length polymorphism fragments are amplified under very selective conditionsâ€”each fragment is flanked by two restriction enzyme recognition sites (EcoRI and MseI in this case), and the amplification specificity is determined by the six selective nucleotides (3 + 3) internal to the restriction sites that extend beyond the 3â€²-end of each primer. Therefore, while a single set of criteria results in successful amplification of any given fragment, amplification failure (fragment absence) can be attributed to at least 18 distinct events: a change (mutation) in one or more of the 16 critical nucleotides (6 for EcoRI + 4 for MseI + 6 selective), or an insertion or deletion event (indel) that encompasses either of the terminal restriction sites or the sequence between them. Subsequent analyses could potentially be confounded because it is impossible to distinguish between any of the multiple events that lead to fragment absence. Dice's similarity coefficient, which is equivalent to 1 minus Nei and Li's GD ( Nei and Li 1979 ), and Jaccard's coefficient are well suited for the analysis of AFLP data because both only consider shared characters (scores of 1) within each fragment bin, and give no weight to the shared absence of a band (including shared band absence would introduce homoplasy into the data set for the reasons given above). These methods are advantageous because band absences (scores of 0) are excluded from the analyses, and there are also no assumptions of the Hardyâ€“Weinberg equilibrium. Phenetic analysis is therefore appropriate for use with AFLP data ( Koopman  et al . 2001 ;  Spooner  et al . 2005 ).  Scoring of non-homologous fragments (co-migrating fragments that have different sequences) is one potential source of homoplasy that can introduce error into distance estimates calculated from AFLP data ( DesprÃ©s  et al . 2003 ;  Meudt and Clarke 2007 ). However, the few studies that have addressed this issue through DNA sequencing found a high degree of identity in the sequenced AFLP fragments ( Simmons  et al . 2007 ). At lower taxonomic levels, AFLP fragment-size homoplasy will be minimal, and can be expected to have little effect in intraspecific studies ( Tremetsberger  et al . 2006 ). Indeed, recent computer simulations based on sequenced genomes indicated that homologies of co-migrating AFLP fragments are greater between closely related taxa, and that fragment-size homoplasy is much lower in organisms with small (&lt;400 Mbp) versus large (&gt;2 Gbp) genomes ( Althoff  et al . 2007 ).  The intent of this study was to examine intraspecific relationships within a group of wild collections and cultivars of  S. speciosa . In the Dice/UPGMA dendrogram (Fig.Â  3 ), the  S. speciosa  accessions were divided into two major clusters (A and B). Within cluster A, there was a major division that essentially separated all of the cultivars from the majority of the wild collections (secondary clusters A1 and A2). These two subclusters were further subdivided into two (A1) and three (A2) well-supported tertiary clusters. Cluster A1-1 contained three plants collected in the Cabo Frio region of south-eastern Rio de Janeiro state (AC1503, â€˜Buziosâ€™ and â€˜Cabo Frioâ€™) and had very high statistical support. The very close identity with â€˜Cabo Frioâ€™ implies that the commercial accession â€˜Chiltern Seedsâ€™ also originated in that area. The four members of cluster A1-1, including â€˜Espirito Santoâ€™, are united by their common morphology in that they are relatively small plants with distinctive bright green foliage and small lavender flowers. Cluster A1-2, which is a sister to A1-1, contains three accessions (â€˜Domingos Martinsâ€™, â€˜Reginaâ€™ and â€˜Santa Teresaâ€™) that have dark-coloured leaves with silver veins and purple flowers. â€˜Reginaâ€™ is of unknown origin ( Sprague 1904 ), while both â€˜Domingos Martinsâ€™ and â€˜Santa Teresaâ€™ originated in EspÃ­rito Santo state. â€˜Carangolaâ€™, a unique form with bi-coloured flowers from Minas Gerais, also resides in cluster A1-2, although the BS support for this relationship is only 61 %. Cluster A2 contained both wild and cultivated accessions of  S. speciosa . The four wild collections in A2 all grouped together in subcluster A2-1; â€˜Avenida Niemeyerâ€™ and â€˜SÃ£o Conradoâ€™ were both collected close to the beach in the southern part of Rio de Janeiro, and are larger plants with large, dark purple flowers. â€˜JurapÃªâ€™ is an unconfirmed collection from Santa Catarina state that showed affinity with â€˜CMâ€™, although the BS support (51 %) was relatively weak. Considering that the distance between Rio de Janeiro and the closest point in north-eastern Santa Catarina state (Joinville) is &gt;900 km, the purported geographical origin of this collection could be in doubt. â€˜Kaiser Wilhelmâ€™, a peloric â€˜gloxiniaâ€™ cultivar from the late 19th century, was the single cultivated accession in cluster A2-1. Clusters A2-2 and A2-3 contained only cultivated accessions, and it is interesting that the three cultivars with nodding (wild-type) flowers, â€˜Dona Lourdesâ€™, â€˜Purpleâ€™ and â€˜Guataparaâ€™, grouped together in cluster A2-2 (BS = 99 %). The three remaining cultivars in cluster A (JFS4512, â€˜Ken's Whiteâ€™ and â€˜Red with Spotsâ€™) all have peloric flowers and formed a well-supported subcluster (A2-3; BS = 85 %). Cluster B (BS = 99 %) contained  S. macrophylla  and three wild collections of  S. speciosa â€”â€˜AntÃ´nio Diasâ€™, â€˜Cardoso Moreira-pinkâ€™ and â€˜Massaguassuâ€™. â€˜AntÃ´nio Diasâ€™ and â€˜Cardoso Moreira-pinkâ€™ have elongated stems and are morphologically distinct from the other wild forms of  S. speciosa  included in this study.  Principal coordinates analysis was also used to visualize the relationships within the group of 26  Sinningia  accessions. Principal coordinates analysis is an ordination method similar to the principal components analysis, and both are frequently applied to the exploration of AFLP data ( Koopman  et al . 2001 ;  Kim  et al . 2004 ;  Chao  et al . 2005 ;  Fernandez  et al . 2006 ;  Azizi  et al . 2009 ). Cluster assignments from the  Sinningia  Dice/UPGMA tree (Fig.Â  3 ) were preserved in the PCoA (Fig.Â  4 ), and they supported the results of the AFLP phenetic analysis. Two minor differences were noted between the two analyses: (i) in the PCoA, AC1503 is somewhat removed from the other members of cluster A1-1 (â€˜Buziosâ€™, â€˜Cabo Frioâ€™, â€˜Chiltern Seedsâ€™ and â€˜Espirito Santoâ€™), and (ii) â€˜Serra da Vistaâ€™ is included in PCoA cluster A1-2, whereas it was placed between the major clusters A and B in the Dice/UPGMA tree. Principal coordinates analysis also shows that the plants in cluster B do not appear to be closely affiliated with the other  S. speciosa  accessions.  A phylogenetic analysis of the nrITS region was also performed for  S. speciosa . The nrITS sequence is a popular tool in plant systematics, and has been used for investigating species relationships in both Old World and New World Gesneriaceae ( MÃ¶ller and Cronk 1997 ;  Zimmer  et al . 2002 ;  Clark and Zimmer 2003 ;  Roalson  et al . 2005 ;  Clark  et al . 2009 ;  Wang  et al . 2011 ). The nrITS region is most informative at higher taxonomic levels (species and above), although intraspecific ITS sequence variation has been documented in several angiosperm dicot families such as the Apiaceae ( Vargas  et al . 1998 ), Asteraceae ( Baldwin 1993 ), Brassicaceae ( Mayer and Soltis 1999 ;  Pepper and Norwood 2001 ), Fabaceae ( Vander Stappen  et al . 1998 ), Saxifragaceae ( Brochmann  et al . 1998 ;  Vargas  et al . 1999 ), Lamiaceae ( Prather  et al . 2002 ) and Gesneriaceae ( Hughes  et al . 2005 ). In the present study, the nrITS region (ITS1â€“5.8Sâ€“ITS2) was amplified from the same 26  Sinningia  accessions included in the AFLP analysis. Unambiguous nucleotide sequences were obtained for 25 accessions directly from the purified PCR products. Repeated sequencing failures necessitated cloning of the amplified fragments from â€˜Kaiser Wilhelmâ€™, however. Sequencing of several recombinant plasmids revealed that the ITS region is polymorphic in this particular cultivar, and sequences from two representative clones were included in the alignment. Intra-individual nrITS sequence polymorphism can result from incomplete concerted evolution, the process by which repetitive sequences in a gene family become homogenized through gene conversion ( Liao 2008 ). Incomplete concerted evolution of the rRNA gene repeats is suggested in the ancient gymnosperm  Cycas , due to the presence of highly polymorphic functional nrITS repeats as well as many divergent ITS paralogues isolated from individual plants ( Xiao  et al . 2010 ). Incomplete concerted evolution is also apparent in taxa of hybrid origin in Rosaceae ( Campbell  et al . 1997 ;  Ritz  et al . 2005 ), and in many species of  Aeschynanthus , a genus of south-east Asian Gesneriaceae ( Denduangboripant and Cronk 2000 ).  The ML tree (Fig.Â  6 ) shows that the nrITS DNA sequence is phylogenetically informative in  S. speciosa , although several nodes had BS support of &lt;50 %. The most noteworthy feature of the phylogram is that many of the clusters present in the AFLP analyses are retained in the ML tree. Significantly, all of the â€˜gloxiniaâ€™ cultivarsâ€”regardless of flower formâ€”grouped together in one large, well-supported clade (clade #1) along with the two known collections from Rio de Janeiro state (â€˜Avenida Niemeyerâ€™ and â€˜SÃ£o Conradoâ€™). The two ITS sequences from â€˜Kaiser Wilhelmâ€™ reside in this clade, even though they differ at five sites each in ITS1 and ITS2 (nine transitions and one transversion). There is also a 1 bp insertion (T) in KW-C ITS1, which probably accounted for the difficulty sequencing the mixed ITS amplicons directly. Pairings between â€˜Avenida Niemeyerâ€™ and â€˜SÃ£o Conradoâ€™ and between â€˜Ken's Whiteâ€™ and JFS4512 are retained from the AFLP tree, and clade #1 is nearly equivalent to Dice/UPGMA cluster A2. Major differences are the inclusion of â€˜Carangolaâ€™ and â€˜Massaguassuâ€™ in this clade. Also retained in the ML tree is the â€˜AntÃ´nio Diasâ€™â€“â€˜Cardoso Moreira-pinkâ€™ pairing in clade 2-2, and the close relationship between the three collections with dark leaves and silver veins (â€˜Reginaâ€™, â€˜Domingos Martinsâ€™ and â€˜Santa Teresaâ€™) in clade 2-1.  Independent phenetic and phylogenetic analyses of two different data sets (AFLPs and nrITS DNA sequences, respectively) show that the available wild collections of  S. speciosa  comprise a genetically diverse group; estimates of GD calculated from the AFLP data are positively correlated with geographic distance, indicating that the observed diversity could result from reproductive isolation. Unfortunately, there has been no detailed population survey conducted for  S. speciosa , and its present geographical range is poorly delimited at best. In addition, some of the wild collections included here (e.g. â€˜JurapÃªâ€™ and â€˜Massaguassuâ€™) came with anecdotal collection information. For these reasons, this study must be considered preliminary. Nevertheless, several conclusions can be drawn from the results presented here. (i) All of the â€˜gloxiniaâ€™ cultivars reside in cluster A2 and clade #1, evidence that the primary gene pool for the cultivars probably came from plants originating in Rio de Janeiro. This makes sense, because historical records state that several of the early â€˜gloxiniasâ€™ exported to Europe were collected within or near this city ( Hooker 1842 ;  Paxton 1846 ;  Brackenridge 1886 ). However, the separation of three of the erect-flowered cultivars in cluster A2-3 (Fig.Â  3 ) could be an indication that plants from at least one other geographic region contributed genetically to the cultivars grown today. (ii) Plants collected in the Eastern Cape region of Rio de Janeiro state and very southern EspÃ­rito Santo state form a cohesive group. These plants are distinct from those found âˆ¼160 km to the west of the city of Rio de Janeiro and also from plants collected in eastern Minas Gerais and north-eastern EspÃ­rito Santo states. (iii) The unknown wild collection â€˜Reginaâ€™ groups with morphologically similar plants having dark leaves with silver veins in phenetic cluster A1-2 and phylogenetic clade #2-1, and was therefore most probably collected in EspÃ­rito Santo state. (iv) The three cultivars with wild-type (nodding) flowers (â€˜Dona Lourdesâ€™, â€˜Guataparaâ€™ and â€˜Purpleâ€™) in AFLP subcluster A2-2 are distinct from the other cultivars with peloric (erect) flowers. â€˜Dona Lourdesâ€™ and â€˜Guataparaâ€™ have much larger nuclear genomes than any other accessions of  S. speciosa  ( Zaitlin and Pierce 2010 ) and appear to be tetraploids, which could be one factor to account for the observed separation from the other cultivars. (v) The wild collection â€˜JurapÃªâ€™ is almost certainly not from Santa Catarina state, since both analyses group it with plants from Rio de Janeiro and the cultivars. (vi) The taxonomic position of  S. macrophylla  may need to be re-examined. A previous phylogenetic treatment using combined sequence data from both chloroplast and nuclear DNA placed  S. macrophylla  as the sister species to  S. speciosa  ( Perret  et al . 2003 ). The two species share many morphological characters, but the genome of  S. macrophylla  is âˆ¼25 % larger than that of  S. speciosa  ( Zaitlin and Pierce 2010 ). In addition,  S. macrophylla  has a very restricted range in the dry forests of southern Bahia, well isolated from known populations of  S. speciosa  ( Thomas 2007 ;  Araujo and Chautems 2010 ). In the present study, the phenetic analysis places  S. macrophylla  in AFLP cluster B with several divergent forms of  S. speciosa  (FigsÂ  3  and  4 ), and it is nested within  S. speciosa  in clade #2 in the ML tree (Fig.Â  6 ). Further work using molecular markers (see below) and/or other DNA sequences will be required to clarify the relationship between these two taxa.   Sinningia speciosa  is not listed in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (  http://www.iucnredlist.org  ), although many other unlisted species of  Sinningia  meet the criteria for inclusion in the endangered or critically endangered IUCN categories ( Chautems  et al . 2010 ).  Sinningia speciosa  is distributed over a relatively large area, but has almost certainly experienced considerable habitat disruption given that the Mata AtlÃ¢ntica presently exists in âˆ¼245 000 forest fragments, many of which are small, &lt;100 ha in size ( Ribeiro  et al . 2009 ). Recent observations of  S. speciosa  in the field in Brazil (D.Z., December 2011) revealed that (i) populations are often isolated and may consist of very few individuals; (ii) populations do not overlap (they are not sympatric); (iii) many populations grow outside of protected areas, sometimes adjacent to agricultural enterprises; and (iv) the various diverse morphological forms are locally endemic, and some are quite rare. For these reasons, there is an urgent need to discover, describe and systematically sample wild populations of  S. speciosa  for genetic diversity. This laboratory is presently developing a suite of co-dominant genetic markers based on simple sequence repeats ( Morgante  et al . 2002 ) and intron sequences from annotated genes. These markers are highly informative, and will be invaluable for genotyping wild and cultivated germplasm, and for evolutionary studies in  S. speciosa  and its relatives. More importantly, we will be able to quantify the levels of allelic diversity and the extent of gene flow within and between populations of  S. speciosa . This in turn will allow us to define evolutionarily significant units ( Moritz 2002 ), and make recommendations for conservation of this interesting and unique species.
