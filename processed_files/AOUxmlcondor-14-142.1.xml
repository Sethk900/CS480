During 2008&ndash;2009, we evaluated variables hypothesized to be associated with detection probability, detection latency, and behavioral responses of male Golden-winged Warblers in pastures in the Monongahela National Forest, West Virginia, USA. This is the first study of male Golden-winged Warbler detection probability, detection latency, or behavioral response based on point-count sampling with known territory locations and identities for all males. During 3-min passive point counts, detection probability decreased as distance to a male's territory and time since sunrise increased. During 3-min point counts with playback, detection probability decreased as distance to a male's territory increased, but remained constant as time since sunrise increased. Detection probability was greater when point counts included type 2 compared with type 1 song playback, particularly during the first 2 min of type 2 song playback. Golden-winged Warblers primarily use type 1 songs (often <italic>zee bee bee bee</italic> with a higher-pitched first note) in intersexual contexts and type 2 songs (strident, rapid stutter ending with a lower-pitched buzzy note) in intrasexual contexts. Distance to a male's territory, ordinal date, and song playback type were associated with the type of behavioral response to song playback. Overall, ~2 min of type 2 song playback may increase the efficacy of point counts for monitoring populations of Golden-winged Warblers by increasing the conspicuousness of males for visual identification and offsetting the consequences of surveying later in the morning. Because playback may interfere with the ability to detect distant males, it is important to follow playback with a period of passive listening. Our results indicate that even in relatively open pasture vegetation, detection probability of male Golden-winged Warblers is imperfect and highly variable.Considerar la probabilidad de detecci&oacute;n durante los puntos de conteo y sus variables asociadas es importante para monitorear las poblaciones de aves y tiene implicancias para la planificaci&oacute;n de la conservaci&oacute;n, ya que influencia las estimaciones poblacionales. Durante 2008&ndash;2009, evaluamos aquellas variables que se suponen asociadas con la probabilidad de detecci&oacute;n, la latencia de detecci&oacute;n y las respuestas comportamentales de los machos de <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Vermivora chrysoptera</named-content></italic> en los pastizales de la Reserva Forestal Nacional Monongahela, West Virginia. Este es el primer estudio de la probabilidad de detecci&oacute;n, la latencia de detecci&oacute;n y las respuestas comportamentales de los machos de <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">V. chrysoptera</named-content></italic>, utilizando puntos de conteo y conociendo las localizaciones territoriales y las identidades de todos los machos. Durante puntos de conteo pasivos de 3 min, la probabilidad de detecci&oacute;n disminuy&oacute; a medida que aument&oacute; la distancia a los territorios de los machos y el tiempo desde el amanecer. Durante los conteos por punto de 3 min empleando la reproducci&oacute;n de cantos previamente grabados, la probabilidad de detecci&oacute;n disminuy&oacute; a medida que aument&oacute; la distancia al territorio de los machos, pero permaneci&oacute; constante a medida que aument&oacute; el tiempo desde el amanecer. La probabilidad de detecci&oacute;n fue mayor cuando los conteos por punto incluyeron la reproducci&oacute;n de cantos previamente grabados de tipo 2 comparados con los de tipo 1, particularmente durante los primeros 2 min de reproducci&oacute;n de cantos de tipo 2 previamente grabados. Los individuos de <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">V. chrysoptera</named-content></italic> usaron principalmente cantos de tipo 1 (usualmente <italic>zee bee bee bee</italic> con una primera nota m&aacute;s aguda) en contextos intersexuales y cantos de tipo 2 (estridente con un tartamudeo r&aacute;pido que termina con una nota zumbido de baja frecuencia) en contextos intrasexuales. La distancia al territorio de un macho, el n&uacute;mero de fecha ordinal y la reproducci&oacute;n de tipos de canto previamente grabados se asociaron con el tipo de respuesta comportamental ante la reproducci&oacute;n de cantos previamente grabados. En total, la reproducci&oacute;n de ~2 min de cantos de tipo 2 previamente grabados puede aumentar la eficacia de los puntos de conteo para monitorear las poblaciones de <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">V. chrysoptera</named-content></italic>, al aumentar la visibilidad de los machos para su identificaci&oacute;n visual y contrarrestar las consecuencias de censar al final de la ma&ntilde;ana. Debido a que la reproducci&oacute;n de cantos previamente grabados puede interferir con la habilidad para detectar a machos distantes, es importante que luego de la reproducci&oacute;n de cantos previamente grabados siga un per&iacute;odo de escucha pasiva. Nuestros resultados indican que incluso en pastizales relativamente abiertos, la probabilidad de detecci&oacute;n de los machos de <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">V. chrysoptera</named-content></italic> es imperfecta y altamente variable.<italic>Palabras clave:</italic> canto, distancia, estaci&oacute;n, estimaci&oacute;n poblacional, puntos de conteo, reproducci&oacute;n de cantos previamente grabados, tiempoThe Golden-winged Warbler (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Vermivora chrysoptera</named-content></italic>) is listed as endangered in Canada (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca" xlink:type="simple">http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca</ext-link>), is undergoing status review for listing in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-U.S.FishandWildlifeService1">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2011</xref>), and is one subject of a multi-million-dollar conservation partnership between the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (USNRCS) and Fish and Wildlife Service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-USNaturalResourceConservationService1">USNRCS 2012</xref>), necessitating continued monitoring efforts. Unfortunately, Golden-winged Warbler detection probability during point counts, including the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), typically is highly variable and &lt;1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Kubel1">Kubel and Yahner 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Confer2">Confer et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-McNeil1">McNeil et al. 2014</xref>). The birds' high-frequency (6&ndash;9 kHz) song, which they sing infrequently even during peak breeding times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Ficken1">Ficken and Ficken 1967</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Highsmith1">Highsmith 1989</xref>), degrades quickly over distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Marten1">Marten and Marler 1977</xref>) and may be difficult to detect, depending on observer age and experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Emlen1">Emlen and DeJong 1992</xref>). As a result, investigators sometimes propose using audio playback of conspecific songs (hereafter &ldquo;playback&rdquo;) during point counts to increase detection probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Kubel1">Kubel and Yahner 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-McNeil1">McNeil et al. 2014</xref>), defined as the probability of an observer detecting an individual bird during a point count.Golden-winged Warblers have 2 song types, each with considerable variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Harper1">Harper et al. 2010</xref>). The type 1 song, an introductory note followed by 3 lower-frequency notes, is used primarily in intersexual contexts (Highsmith 1989) but elicits strongest intrasexual responses (Ficken and Ficken 1973). Type 1 song may serve as an isolating mechanism between Golden-winged and Blue-winged warblers (<italic>V. cyanoptera</italic>; Ficken and Ficken 1968, Gill and Murray 1972). Type 2 song is used primarily in intrasexual contexts, such that during agonistic encounters the proportion of type 1 song decreases and the proportion of type 2 song increases. Interspecific discrimination of type 2 song is poor for Golden-winged and Blue-winged warblers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Gill1">Gill and Murray 1972</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Highsmith1">Highsmith 1989</xref>). Golden-winged and Blue-winged warblers and their hybrids may sing either or both of the parent species' type 1 songs, and type 2 songs can be indistinguishable among species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Confer1">Confer et al. 2011</xref>), making aural identification problematic in areas of sympatry. Use of 1.3 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Kubel1">Kubel and Yahner 2007</xref>) and 3 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-McNeil1">McNeil et al. 2014</xref>) of type 1 playback resulted in increases of 0.07&ndash;0.19 and 0.22 in detection probability, respectively. Detection probability may increase with playback duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Kroodsma1">Kroodsma 1986</xref>), but detection latency, defined as the amount of time elapsed to initial detection of an individual bird, has not been studied in Golden-winged Warblers. Measuring detection latency, as opposed to conducting point counts with different playback durations, could help establish a standard playback duration and listening interval for this species by determining how long it takes for males to respond. A comparison of detection probability using playback of both song types also has not been completed. Overall, a better understanding of detection probability with playback is needed to improve monitoring efforts for Golden-winged Warblers.Golden-winged Warbler singing rates decrease as the breeding season progresses, especially after pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Ficken1">Ficken and Ficken 1967</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Highsmith1">Highsmith 1989</xref>), resulting in seasonal decreases in detection probability during point counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Kubel1">Kubel and Yahner 2007</xref>). As such, point-count results may be biased by when they are conducted (e.g., BBS routes in West Virginia, USA, generally conducted during May 27&ndash;July 7; T. R. Fox personal communication). Measuring detection probability at different times during the breeding season can improve monitoring efforts by revealing the times of the season with the greatest detection probabilities and the consequences of surveying outside of this window.Partners in Flight population estimates, which were derived from BBS data and were considered when prioritizing conservation efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Rich1">Rich et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Panjabi1">Panjabi et al. 2005</xref>), originally relied on the assumption that all male Golden-winged Warblers present within 200 m of point-count locations were detected during a 3-min point count without playback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Rosenberg1">Rosenberg and Blancher 2005</xref>). However, the species' peak singing times do not coincide well with the BBS seasonal sample period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Kubel1">Kubel and Yahner 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Confer2">Confer et al. (2008)</xref> used BBS-style point counts in southern New York and detected only 3&percnt; of Golden-winged Warblers. Additional tests of the &ldquo;200-m assumption&rdquo; are needed because other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Kubel1">Kubel and Yahner 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Confer2">Confer et al. 2008</xref>) did not explicitly test for associations between detection probability and distance or include pasturelands, a relatively open shrubland cover type used for nesting in the central and southern Appalachian regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Aldinger1">Aldinger and Wood 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Aldinger2">Aldinger et al. 2015</xref>). Only after further tests of the 200-m assumption, under various conditions representative of those found along BBS routes, can we arrive at more accurate estimates of population size for Golden-winged Warblers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-PartnersinFlightScienceCommittee1">Partners in Flight Science Committee 2013</xref>).We designed our study to examine detection probability, detection latency, and implied perfect detection of behavioral responses within 200 m of point-count locations, the presumed maximum detection distance for male Golden-winged Warblers, with the objective of improving population estimates that are based on assumptions related to point-count sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Rosenberg1">Rosenberg and Blancher 2005</xref>). We evaluated associations of detection probability, detection latency, and behavioral responses with (1) distance, (2) observer, (3) use of playback, (4) playback type, (5) time since sunrise, and (6) time of season. This study represents an important contribution to the literature on detection probability because our empirically derived (rather than theoretically derived) estimates of detection probability provide a better understanding of the magnitude and variability of previous estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Kubel1">Kubel and Yahner 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Confer2">Confer et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-McNeil1">McNeil et al. 2014</xref>) and because our methods could be applied to other species.We studied 6 fenced pastures (334 ha; 800&ndash;1,200 m elevation) on the Monongahela National Forest in West Virginia, USA: 4 pastures (99 ha; range: 7&ndash;41 ha) near Elkins, Randolph County, during 2008&ndash;2009 and 2 pastures (117 ha total fenced area; range: 56&ndash;179 ha) near Marlinton, Pocahontas County, during 2009. Annual (May 15&ndash;October 15) low-intensity grazing by cattle and horses and periodic mowing maintained the shrubland stage of succession. Based on manual digitization of aerial photographs, vegetative cover types were patchily distributed within pastures and included grass and herbaceous vegetation (range: 5&ndash;30&percnt;), raspberry and blackberry (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Rubus</named-content></italic> spp.; range: 5&ndash;10&percnt;), shrub and sapling (range: 30&ndash;80&percnt;), and canopy tree (&gt;10 cm diameter at breast height &lsqb;dbh&rsqb;; range: 5&ndash;40&percnt;) cover surrounded by contiguous closed-canopy forest (trees &gt;10 cm dbh). Dominant plant species included sweet vernalgrass (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Anthoxanthum odoratum</named-content></italic>), goldenrod (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Solidago</named-content></italic> spp.), devil's darning needles (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Clematis virginiana</named-content></italic>), blackberry, hawthorn (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Crataegus</named-content></italic> spp.), and black locust (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Robinia pseudoacacia</named-content></italic>). Most Golden-winged Warbler territories were near the perimeters of the pastures, where the dominant cover type transitioned from grasses to shrubs to contiguous closed-canopy forest. To delineate areas for Golden-winged Warbler point counts and territory mapping, we defined &ldquo;territory vegetation&rdquo; as patches &ge;0.2 ha of herbaceous (range: 45&ndash;75&percnt;), shrub (range: 45&ndash;75&percnt;), and canopy (range: 5&ndash;45&percnt;) cover adjacent to a closed-canopy forest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Confer1">Confer et al. 2011</xref>).We initially established point-count locations on a 100 &times; 100 m grid overlain on each pasture. We eliminated point-count locations that were not within Golden-winged Warbler territory vegetation or that were close enough to other point-count locations that males might be double-counted. The final remaining point-count locations (2008, <italic>n</italic> &equals; 12; 2009, <italic>n</italic> &equals; 28) were &ge;263 m apart. The number of point-count locations per pasture (range: 2&ndash;9) depended on the amount of territory vegetation available in each pasture. Because all territory vegetation on the 6 pastures was within 200 m of a point-count location and pastures were surrounded by nearly 100&percnt; closed-canopy forest with open understory (trees &gt;10 cm dbh), we assumed that males generally were present and detectable within the estimated maximum detection distance of 200 m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Rosenberg1">Rosenberg and Blancher 2005</xref>). Radio-tagged males on these pastures were in territory vegetation 98&percnt; of the time (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 488 telemetry locations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Frantz1">Frantz et al. 2015</xref>). Even males that entered forested areas generally would still be within 200 m of point-count locations because of the close juxtaposition of territory vegetation and forest.During May 1&ndash;9 of each year, K.R.A. trained all observers together as a group. We observed male warblers in the field, examined field-guide illustrations, and listened to song recordings to practice identification of <italic>Vermivora</italic> species by sight and sound. To practice identification of individual male warblers, we practiced reading color-band combinations using binoculars and compared plumage and song characteristics of neighboring male warblers. We practiced distance estimation by estimating known distances. To apply the aforementioned training and to practice interpretation of behavioral responses to playback, we conducted practice point counts as a group and compared our results at the end of the point count. Practice-group point counts served to help standardize point-count results among observers.Observers (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 3 in 2008, <italic>n</italic> &equals; 6 in 2009, <italic>n</italic> &equals; 6 different observers total) conducted 2 types of 6-min variable-radius point counts (Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-t05">Table 5</xref>) at each point-count location during each of 3 periods (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 6 counts point<sup>&minus;1</sup> year<sup>&minus;1</sup>). Each 6-min point count included a 3-min passive-listening portion (passive subcount) and a 3-min playback portion (playback subcount) using either type 1 or type 2 song. The 3 periods were early (May 10&ndash;21), middle (May 22&ndash;June 2), and late (June 3&ndash;15). They coincided with (1) the peak breeding season of Golden-winged Warblers in this part of West Virginia (2008&ndash;2014; earliest egg date &equals; May 9 &plusmn; 1.5 &lsqb;SE&rsqb; days, latest active nest &equals; June 23 &plusmn; 2.2 days; K. R. Aldinger personal observation); (2) Golden-winged Warbler Atlas Project (GOWAP) survey dates (May 10&ndash;June 15, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-CornellLabofOrnithology1">Cornell Lab of Ornithology 2008</xref>); and (3) the BBS, which generally occurs during June in West Virginia (T. R. Fox personal communication). We conducted point counts only during periods of clear, calm weather. We visited point-count locations during 0550&ndash;1005 hours EDT but in a different order on each visit to balance the possible effect of time since sunrise.We defined a &ldquo;pasture survey&rdquo; as visiting all the point-count locations in a single pasture during a single period using a single point-count type (type 1 or type 2 song). We completed a pasture survey (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 60) in 1&ndash;4 visits (1.3 &plusmn; 0.1 visits) spanning 1&ndash;6 days (1.6 &plusmn; 0.2 days) with 1 point-count type (type 1 or type 2, order determined by coin flip), then repeated the pasture survey with the remaining point-count type 1&ndash;5 days (2.0 &plusmn; 0.2 days) later (here and below, results are presented as means &plusmn; SE). Because of the limited number of point-count locations with breeding populations of Golden-winged Warblers, we used a repeated-measures design whereby we visited each point-count location under all 6 treatment combinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Wiley1">Wiley 2003</xref>).We recorded the 1-min interval when each male was initially detected and all subsequent 1-min intervals in which males were detected. We estimated initial detection distance to the nearest 5 m and checked our estimates by recording the bird's location on an aerial photograph and measuring the distance using a scale bar. We recorded whether detections were visual and the male's color-band combination if detected visually (46&percnt; of 219 detections were visually confirmed during the point count). If we could not visually confirm a male's color-band combination during the point count and we were unable to visually confirm the male's color-band combination while traveling between point-count locations, we used the male's location, individual variation in song (e.g., different numbers of notes or changes in pitch) and singing behavior (e.g., singing type 2 songs exclusively), and our detailed records of the number and location of territories based on almost daily visits (see below) to infer the male's identity. We recorded behavioral responses to playback if they occurred during the playback subcount. Possible behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Kubel1">Kubel and Yahner 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Confer1">Confer et al. 2011</xref>) included approaching the speaker, initiating type 1 or type 2 songs or chipping vocalizations, shortening (fewer notes than in prestimulus songs) or lengthening (more notes) songs, singing a whisper song (a quiet version often given during agonistic encounters or in the presence of a female), switching song type, increasing the rate of singing, and other territorial displays (e.g., slow undulating moth-flight, flaring crown feathers, and circling the speaker). Observers interpreted and recorded all behavioral responses in the field.We broadcast songs at a volume similar to that of an undisturbed singing male Golden-winged Warbler and at a low enough volume to avoid audible distortion or feedback from the speaker (no. 277-1008, Radio Shack, Fort Worth, Texas, USA). In prestudy field tests, observers could hear type 1 and type 2 song broadcasts at distances of ~120 m in territory vegetation.We captured males in mist nets using playback of songs of 6 different male Golden-winged Warblers and a decoy to avoid habituation to playback. We marked males with unique combinations of colored leg bands (44&percnt; of males in 2008 and 76&percnt; of males in 2009). Unmarked males generally were neighbored by marked males, allowing the lack of color bands to serve as a mark. At least every other day during May and June, 2008&ndash;2009, from dawn to 1400 hours EDT, we searched all available territory vegetation (64 ha with 4 observers in 2008; 165 ha with 6 observers in 2009) and recorded locations of males either on printed maps of 2007 National Agriculture Imagery Program imagery or on Garmin eTrex global positioning system units (typically accurate to &lt;5 m). We used point-count locations as a spot-mapping grid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Bibby1">Bibby et al. 2000</xref>) to ensure that we searched all territory vegetation available on each pasture. To avoid collecting locations not representative of a male's breeding territory, during territory mapping we watched individual males for behavioral cues (i.e. fledgling feeding, frequent or extended extraterritorial movements, and lack of singing and territorial defense) that suggested the completion of their nesting period. We delineated a territory when we observed a male on &ge;3 visits over &ge;8 visits to a pasture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Robbins1">Robbins 1970</xref>). Between nest searching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Aldinger1">Aldinger and Wood 2014</xref>), territory mapping, and point counts, we made &gt;8 visits to each pasture and recorded locations of individual males (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 59 males, 65 territories) on 9.0 &plusmn; 0.7 days. We were confident that all territorial males were mapped and counted and that all territories were located within the pastures. We created minimum convex polygons (MCPs) for each male using 100&percnt; of the locations recorded during its nesting period (i.e. after establishment of a territory and before fledging young). Dates of all locations were within the mean nesting period of May 9&ndash;June 23 for these pastures (K. R. Aldinger personal observation). We considered our MCPs as approximations of the principal defended areas of the breeding territories of male Golden-winged Warblers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Anich1">Anich et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Frantz1">Frantz et al. 2015</xref>). For all males, we measured the distance from the center of the male's MCP to the nearest point-count location.In 2010, we collected blood samples from phenotypic Golden-winged Warblers (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 22) on the same pastures as part of a collaborative study on genetic introgression among <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Vermivora</named-content></italic> spp. using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). We used the results of the genetic analysis to gauge the level of genetic introgression among phenotypic Golden-winged Warblers included in the study.We included male Golden-winged Warbler phenotypes (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 59 males, <italic>n</italic> &equals; 65 territories, <italic>n</italic> &equals; 219 detections) in analyses and excluded Blue-winged Warbler (0 males, 0 territories, 1 detection) and hybrid (2 males, 2 territories, 6 detections) phenotypes. For modeling of detection probability, detection latency, and behavioral responses, we formulated our models at the individual level, such that an individual male Golden-winged Warbler's detection status, detection latency, or behavioral response during a subcount was a function of independent variables measured at the time of that subcount. This approach relied on the assumption that we accurately identified which males were detected or not detected during each subcount. We specified male and pasture IDs as random effects in all models because we sampled each male and pasture during each time of season (early, middle, and late) and with each point-count type (type 1 and type 2 song). Six color-banded males were known to be present in both years. When we detected an individual male during multiple point counts during a pasture survey (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 20 duplicate detections), we retained only the detection with a behavioral response related to territory defense or a shorter detection distance to the center of the male's MCP.For all models, when we detected a specific male during a pasture survey, we assigned to that male the ordinal date and time since sunrise of the subcount during which the male was detected. When we failed to detect a specific male during a pasture survey, we assigned to that male the ordinal date and starting time since sunrise of the subcount nearest to the center of that male's MCP for the pasture survey during which the male was not detected. To calculate time since sunrise, we subtracted the subcount start time from the local sunrise time. We obtained daily sunrise times annually for Elkins and Marlinton, West Virginia, from the U.S. Naval Observatory (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/RS_OneYear.php" xlink:type="simple">http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/RS&lowbar;OneYear.php</ext-link>). For all males, our distance variable was the distance from the center of the male's MCP to the nearest point-count location. We considered differences statistically significant at &alpha; &le; 0.05.We ran 2 separate models to evaluate detection probability during passive subcounts (hereafter &ldquo;passive detection probability model&rdquo;) and playback subcounts (&ldquo;playback detection probability model&rdquo;). We used logistic mixed-effects models in package &lsquo;lme4&prime; version 1.1-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Bates1">Bates et al. 2014</xref>) in program R version 3.1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-RDevelopmentCoreTeam1">R Development Core Team 2014</xref>) to model associations between detection status and distance, observer, ordinal date, playback subcount type (type 1 and type 2; for playback subcounts only), time since sunrise, and year. We considered each male a Bernoulli trial wherein a male could be detected (&ldquo;1&rdquo;) during &ge;1 min during a subcount or not detected (&ldquo;0&rdquo;) during a subcount.We ran 2 separate models to evaluate detection latency during passive subcounts (hereafter &ldquo;passive latency model&rdquo;) and playback subcounts (&ldquo;playback latency model&rdquo;). We used Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo multinomial logistic mixed-effects models in package &lsquo;MCMCglmm' version 2.21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Hadfield2">Hadfield 2010</xref>) in program R to model associations between detection latency and distance, ordinal date, playback subcount type (type 1 or type 2 song; for playback subcounts only), time since sunrise, and year. We followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Hadfield1">Hadfield (2009)</xref> to set up and run the latency models, and we used the least-informative proper priors. We set the number of iterations to 100,000 preceded by a burn-in period of 15,000 iterations. We chose the &ldquo;categorical&rdquo; family in &lsquo;MCMCglmm' and assigned each response to 1 of 4 mutually exclusive latency categories: not detected, minute 1, minute 2, and minute 3. We set the &ldquo;not detected&rdquo; category as the baseline for comparison.To model associations between behavioral responses during playback subcounts and distance, ordinal date, playback subcount type (type 1 or type 2 song), time since sunrise, and year (hereafter &ldquo;behavioral response model&rdquo;), we used the same parameters and process described above for the playback latency model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Hadfield2">Hadfield 2010</xref>). We assigned each behavioral response to 1 of 4 mutually exclusive behavioral response categories: vocal response (initiate type 1, 2, or chipping; increase singing rate; whisper; shorten or lengthen song; switch song type), territorial response (approach audio device and territorial display), elaborate response (both a vocal and territorial response as described above), and no response (either detected but without an apparent response to playback or not detected, because both represent a lack of detectable response). We set the &ldquo;no response&rdquo; category as the baseline for comparison.Male Golden-winged Warblers began arriving and establishing territories on April 26, 2008, and April 28, 2009. We delineated 27 Golden-winged Warbler territories in 2008 and 38 in 2009, representing 59 different males. We observed presumed breeding pairs in 59&percnt; of territories (all Golden-winged Warbler &times; Golden-winged Warbler pairs), based on social pairing criteria in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Will1">Will (1986)</xref>, although we may have underestimated pairing rate based on nest discovery rates on these pastures in later years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Aldinger1">Aldinger and Wood 2014</xref>). Thus, we did not include pairing status in our analyses. On these pastures in 2010, no phenotypic Golden-winged Warblers (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 22) had Blue-winged Warbler mtDNA (L. M. Stenzler, Cornell Lab of Ornithology, personal communication).Mean detection probability of male Golden-winged Warblers during passive subcounts was 0.45 &plusmn; 0.02 and decreased as distance to a male's MCP center increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-f01">Figure 1</xref>A) and as time since sunrise increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-f01">Figure 1</xref>B).

Type 2 playback subcounts (0.52 &plusmn; 0.02) had greater detection probability than type 1 subcounts (0.39 &plusmn; 0.02). Detection probability during playback subcounts was not associated with observer, ordinal date, time since sunrise, or year (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-t01">Table 1</xref>).Using passive subcounts, most males were not detected (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 213), followed by detections during minutes 1 (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 128), 2 (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 32), and 3 (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 17).

For example, using the passive latency model, a 1-unit increase in distance was associated (<italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.003) with a decrease in the log odds of detection during minute 1, compared with no detection in the amount of 0.011.

Parameter estimates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-t03">Table 3</xref>) for the behavioral response model can be interpreted as the log odds of observing elaborate, territorial, or vocal responses compared with no response (the baseline).

We specified male (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 59) and pasture (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 6) IDs as random effects. Values in bold are statistically significant.This is the first study of male Golden-winged Warbler detection probability, detection latency, or behavioral response to have known territory locations and identities for all males. Mean detection probability values for our passive and playback subcounts were imperfect and generally equal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-f01">Figure 1</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-f01">1</xref>C). Passive subcounts were within the range of comparable studies, whereas playback subcounts, particularly type 1 subcounts, were near the lower end of the range of comparable studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-t04">Table 4</xref>). In part, we attribute our lower values of mean detection probability during playback subcounts to the fact that we recorded detections while playback was being broadcast, as opposed to after the playback. We further add that our study design was biased toward increased detection probability, in that our point-count observers had prior knowledge of male locations and singing behavior from territory mapping and passive subcounts that occurred immediately before our playback subcounts. Thus, in contrast to other studies, we did not see a pronounced difference in Golden-winged Warbler detection probability between passive and playback subcounts. Nonetheless, our results add to the growing knowledge that detection probability during 3-min point counts is consistently &lt;1.0, regardless of the conditions under which point counts are conducted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Sauer1">Sauer et al. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Huffman1">Huffman 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Kubel1">Kubel and Yahner 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Confer2">Confer et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-McNeil1">McNeil et al. 2014</xref>) and provide a mechanistic explanation of how variables are associated with detection probability.Summary results from studies of male Golden-winged Warbler detection probability.Revisions to the assumed maximum detection distance (125 m in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Panjabi1">Panjabi et al. 2005</xref>) would decrease the error in population estimates for Golden-winged Warblers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Thogmartin1">Thogmartin 2010</xref>), but population size likely would still be underestimated because detection probability during our passive subcounts was &lt;1.0 at distances &lt;125 m. In fact, our mean detection probability during passive subcounts ranged from 0.60 when MCP centers were 4 m (the minimum distance) from a point-count location to 0.39 when MCP centers were 125 m from a point-count location. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Confer2">Confer et al. (2008)</xref> detected a male Golden-winged Warbler with an active nest within 50 m of a point-count location during only 12&percnt; of 3-min point counts. A single species-specific correction factor for converting relative counts into absolute population estimates would be convenient but seems unlikely to be agreed upon, even with further research, because of variability in detection probability among observers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Sauer1">Sauer et al. 1994</xref>), distances, geographic locations, point-count protocols, vegetation community types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Kubel1">Kubel and Yahner 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Confer2">Confer et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-McNeil1">McNeil et al. 2014</xref>), and weather (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Huffman1">Huffman 1997</xref>). Furthermore, there are multiple reliable methods that account for detection probability and do not require 100&percnt; detection&mdash;for example, distance sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Thomas1">Thomas et al. 2010</xref>), mark&ndash;recapture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-White1">White and Burnham 1999</xref>), time removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Farnsworth2">Farnsworth et al. 2002</xref>), and combinations of these methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Amundson1">Amundson et al. 2014</xref>) can be used to estimate population size if extra information is collected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Farnsworth1">Farnsworth et al. 2005</xref>).Detection probability during passive and playback subcounts and the likelihood of elaborate and territorial responses decreased as distance from a point-count location to a male's MCP center increased. Our distance variable does not explicitly address an observer's ability to detect a Golden-winged Warbler among distances, but rather the probability that a Golden-winged Warbler will be detected given the location of its territory in relation to a point-count location. Still, based on our passive and playback detection probability models and the distances at which we detected males (maximum &equals; 190 m), the maximum detection distance for Golden-winged Warblers probably is ~200 m, though detection probability at such distances is low (0.28 with passive subcounts and 0.20 with playback subcounts). Based on the detection probabilities at 200 m and the shapes of the curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-f01">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-f01">1</xref>C, playback appears to have decreased detection probability for distant males. We suspect that aural interference from the playback speaker inhibited observers' ability to hear distant males. This conclusion is further supported by the similarity of overall detection probability estimates for passive and playback subcounts (both 0.45). Distant males may have heard the playback but did not show a behavioral response because vegetation unsuitable for territories (e.g., extensive grassland) or other territorial males prevented them from approaching or because they did not perceive playback at such a long distance to be a threat.Detection probability for most songbirds decreases as the morning progresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Robbins2">Robbins 1981</xref>), presumably because of decreasing natural singing rates. Undisturbed Golden-winged Warblers on our pastures also sang less as the period during 0550&ndash;1005 hours EDT progressed, indicated by decreasing detection probability during passive subcounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-f01">Figure 1</xref>B). Detection probability and behavioral responses during our playback subcounts, however, were not associated with time since sunrise, which suggests that playback can be an effective tool to compensate for temporal reductions in detection probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Lynch1">Lynch 1995</xref>). For effective compensation of temporal reductions in detection probability, it is important to follow a playback subcount with a passive subcount to detect males that were not detected during the playback subcount because of aural interference, as was presumably the cause of similar mean detection probabilities for both passive and playback subcounts in our study.Golden-winged Warbler singing rates are known to decrease as the breeding season progresses, particularly after pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Ficken1">Ficken and Ficken 1967</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Highsmith1">Highsmith 1989</xref>), leading to decreases in detection probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Kubel1">Kubel and Yahner 2007</xref>). However, we found no significant decrease in detection probability during May 10&ndash;June 7 on our pastures using passive or playback subcounts. Our point counts probably ended before the time when singing rates declined significantly as nests on these pastures can be active throughout June (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Aldinger1">Aldinger and Wood 2014</xref>). It is difficult to speculate about detection probability outside of our point-count season, but our results suggest that researchers may be able to assume constant detection probability if point counts begin ~2 wk after arrival of the first males and last ~4 wk. Conversely, elaborate and territorial responses using playback subcounts decreased significantly as the season progressed. Whether the decreases in behavioral responses were due to breeding phenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Catchpole1">Catchpole 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Yahner1">Yahner and Ross 1995</xref>) or habituation to playback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Fisher1">Fisher 1954</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Harris1">Harris and Haskell 2013</xref>) was unclear. Anecdotally, during GOWAP surveys in Randolph and Pocahontas counties in 2008 and 2009, males sampled outside of our pastures similarly appeared to be less responsive to playback (e.g., fewer approaches and aggressive type 2 songs) later in the season. Because of the difficulty in finding adequate samples sizes of Golden-winged Warblers for playback experiments, the present study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Kubel1">Kubel and Yahner (2007)</xref> used repeated measures designs and were unable to determine reasons for declining detection probability or behavioral responses. Nonetheless, the available evidence seems to suggest that playback is most effective early in the breeding season for eliciting responses from male Golden-winged Warblers, thereby increasing visual identification.Male Golden-winged Warblers often sing type 2 songs in intrasexual territorial disputes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Highsmith1">Highsmith 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Confer1">Confer et al. 2011</xref>). As such, we expected type 2 playback subcounts to have greater detection probability than type 1 playback subcounts because males responding to the former might perceive our playback as an aggressive intruder. Not only did our playback detection probability and latency models support this presumption, but our behavioral response model also showed that territorial response was more likely with type 2 than with type 1 playback. If using type 2 song with point counts, it is important to consider potential responses by and misidentification of Blue-winged Warblers (and hybrids), which may not distinguish between type 2 songs of their own species and those of Golden-winged Warblers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Gill1">Gill and Murray 1972</xref>). On the other hand, we now suspect that interspecific discrimination of type 1 songs also may be poor because of increasing range overlap and genetic introgression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Vallender1">Vallender et al. 2009</xref>), despite historical evidence that Golden-winged and Blue-winged warblers responded only weakly or rarely to each other's type 1 songs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Ficken3">Ficken and Ficken 1969</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Gill1">Gill and Murray 1972</xref>). Even in the case that multiple <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Vermivora</named-content></italic> spp. phenotypes all respond to type 2 playback, our results suggest that their response is more likely to be rapid (during the first 2 min of playback) and territorial (e.g., approach, slow undulating moth-flight, and circling the speaker) than when using type 1 playback, so visual confirmation of phenotype is likely. We caution readers, however, that our playback results are based on recordings from 2 males and that characteristics of their songs could have contributed to our results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Kroodsma2">Kroodsma et al. 2001</xref>).The effect of point-count length on detection probability has been studied extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Ralph1">Ralph et al. 1995</xref>) but, to our knowledge, the effect of playback duration has not been evaluated. Although we did not vary playback duration explicitly, our playback latency model gives insight into the responses of males as playback duration increased up to 3 min. Our playback latency model suggested that the previously documented difference in detection probability between playback subcount types was the result of a greater number of detections occurring during the first 2 min of type 2 playback subcounts. By minute 3, both playback subcount types were equal. Thus, if we consider mean detection probabilities from passive subcounts (0.45), type 1 playback subcounts (0.39), and type 2 playback subcounts (0.52) and notice that type 1 playback subcounts are lower than passive subcounts in terms of detection probability, then by minute 3 our type 2 playback subcounts probably are not effectively increasing detection probability. Therefore, our results suggest that 2 min of type 2 playback (again, followed by passive listening) will result in the most efficient (detections per unit time) point-count protocol.Our results are strong because they were derived empirically (i.e. from known detections and nondetections of males with known locations and identities) rather than theoretically (i.e. from distance-sampling, mark&ndash;recapture, or time-removal methods). We have provided important information on variables associated with detection probability, detection latency, and behavioral responses of Golden-winged Warblers that can be considered when designing monitoring protocols. Given the imperiled status of Golden-winged Warbler populations in the Appalachian Mountain region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Roth1">Roth et al. 2012</xref>) and the interest in managing breeding habitat (e.g., USNRCS 2012), a standardized and logistically feasible monitoring program is needed. Passive point counts preceded by 2 min of type 2 playback, starting 11 min before sunrise to 237 min after sunrise, and conducted 2&ndash;6 wk after males first arrive on territory may yield constant and maximum, although imperfect, detection probability. Overall, even with our study design biased toward increased detection probability, detection probability was imperfect at short distances, during peak singing times, and with the aid of playback.Logistic and administrative support was provided by the U.S. Geological Survey West Virginia Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and by the Division of Forestry and Natural Resources at West Virginia University. Housing was provided by the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources (WVDNR) Elkins Operation Center and the Littlefield family. The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) allowed access to the pastures.

We used recordings of type 1 and type 2 songs taken from the protocol of the Golden-winged Warbler Atlas Project (for protocol information and access to recordings, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0010-5422-117-3-364-Roth1">Roth et al. 2012</xref>: appendices F&ndash;G) because these songs appeared to reflect the local dialect and were widely used with point counts for Golden-winged Warblers (K. R. Aldinger personal observation).
