Estimation of Fractional Vegetation Cover in Opencast Coal Mine Dump Area Using Landsat TM DataCoal mine dump area accounts for a multitude of land and poses a threat to local environment. Revegetation plays an important role in providing ecological and economic benefits to mine dump area. Vegetation is an important indicator for the condition of revegetation in opencast coal mine dump area. Remote sensing data are great valuable to monitor vegetation growing condition. The objective of this research is to estimate fractional vegetation from a Landsat TM image through extracting vegetation index (VI) and building regression models. In this paper, kinds of empirical models were built to estimate fractional vegetation cover (FVC). A camera was used to acquire field measured data. Maximum likelihood method was adopted to extract vegetation coverage information from photograph. Landsat TM remote sensing data was used as basic data and ERDAS software was used to calculate four types of vegetation indices NDVI, SR, DVI and MSAVI. Linear model, twice polynomial model, thrice polynomial model, exponential model and power function model were tested in this paper. By comparing the relativity of vegetation and FVC, we find that thrice polynomial model is more suitable to estimate FVC than other models. We also find that NDVI and MSAVI are more applicable to extract vegetation information especially in opencast coal mine dump area.
