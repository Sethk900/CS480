A new species of Lithobius (Monotarsobius) Verhoeff, 1905 (Lithobiomorpha, Lithobiidae) from ChinaAbstract The present paper deals with a new species of the genus Lithobius Leach, 1814, Lithobius (Monotarsobius) songi sp. n.(Lithobiomorpha: Lithobiidae) recently discovered in Hebei Province, China. Morphologically it resembles Lithobius (Monotarsobius) holstii (Pocock, 1895) from China and Japan but could be well distinguished from latter by havinga Tömösváry’s organ slightly smaller than the adjoining ocelli, different leg plectrotaxy and tridentate claw of female gonopods. A key to the Chinese Lithobius (Monotarsobius)species is presented.
