Bryozoa collected by the United States Antarctic Research Program: new taxa and new recordsThirty-two species of cheilostomate Bryozoa are described and illustrated from 26 stations sampled by the United States Antarctic Research Program, including 29 new species and two new genera. A further new genus is introduced for two species formerly attributed to Osthimosia Jullien, 1888. One station was located in the Ross Sea and three in the cold temperate South Pacific; 14 stations were sampled in the region of the Scotia Arc, south of the Antarctic Convergence, and eight from the subantarctic southwest Atlantic, mostly in the vicinity of Tierra del Fuego. Nine new species were present in the Antarctic samples, whereas those from the southwest Atlantic yielded 18 new species and the two new genera. Three of the new subantarctic species are attributed to genera formerly considered to be Antarctic endemics, while the two newly assigned species of Osthimosia are presently known only from Antarctic localities.
