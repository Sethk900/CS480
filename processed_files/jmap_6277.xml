Use of the SDSS test to predict the protein content and bread volume of wheat cultivarsThe relationship between the sodium dodecyl sulphate sedimentation volume (SDSS test) and the protein content and bread volume of wheat cultivars was determined to ascertain whether the SDSS test could be used to predict these parameters of baking quality. This test proved to be a good indication of baking quality as the SDS sedimentation volumes were positively correlated with both protein content and bread volume of the cultivars. Nitrogen fertilization affected the SDS sedimentation volume as well as the protein content and bread volume, thereby affecting the relationship between these parameters. Higher correlation coefficients between the different parameters were found at higher nitrogen applications. Some of the correlation coefficients were affected by the locality where the wheat was grown.
