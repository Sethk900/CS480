Effects of long-term cattle exclosure on vegetation and rodents at a desertified arid grassland siteArid grasslands are often presumed to exist in one of two alternate stable states: grassland or desertified shrubland. While the conversion to shrubland can occur rather rapidly following intense overgrazing, the recovery of perennial grasses is often presumed to be difficult or impossible even with livestock removal. We examined vegetation and rodent communities at a desertified shrubland site from which livestock had been removed for more than four decades. Total shrub cover was similar but differed in composition across the grazing fence. Larrea tridentata had significantly higher cover Outside while Parthenium incanum had significantly higher cover inside the fence. Basal perennial grass cover was significantly higher inside the fence. Rodent diversity was significantly higher inside the fence due to higher abundance and diversity of pocket mice. These data suggest that recovery of perennial grasses at severely desertified sites is possible but may require several decades and that rodent diversity responds positively to such recovery.
