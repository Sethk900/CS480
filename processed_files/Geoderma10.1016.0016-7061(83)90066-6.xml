Geoderma, 30:187--194    In this paper two examples are presented of the investigation by submicroscopic tech-  niques, of partmular problems in the charactermation and analysis of various pedological  features in soils of the "Chaco Deprimido".  The first concerns nodules seen in an alluvial soil. The techniques established their  phosphatic composition and identlhed them as small bone fragments which are under-  going alteration.  The second relates to study of sesquioxldic nodules and cutans in solodised soils and  planosols, and shows them to have a dominantly mangamferous composition; this result  enables one to make certain interpretations concerning the physicochemical conditions  essential for the formatmn of such pedological features.    INTRODUCTION    Microscopic studies of some soil profiles of the "Chaco Deprimido" al-  ready yielded considerable data concerning their composition and organlsa-  tion. Thus, the skeleton and plasma components as well as the various  pedological features were already ldentihed and interpreted at the scale of  optical mmroscopy. Subsequently, particular pedological features as well as  isolated mineral fractions were the object of ultramicroscopic observations  and elemental microanalysis, which yielded results of great interest in rela-  tion to the interpretation of the composition and genesis of these soils  (Morris, 1978b, 1980, 1981a, b; Morris et al., 1982).  Additionally, studies are currently in progress to characterise the sesqui-  oxidic concentration and certain phosphatic nodules seen m soils of this  region. The preliminary results obtained by means of submicroscopic tech-  niques are presented below.    0016-7061/83/$03.00     1983 Elsevier Science Pubhshers B.V    188    MATERIALS AND METHODS    The "Chaco Depnmido" region 1s characterlsed by halomorphlc soils  developed on loessold sediments mainly formed by minerals of volcanm  origin. For the most part, according to the criteria of "Soil Taxonomy"  (U.S.D.A., 1975), the soils are Mollisols and Alfisols with natric horizons.  Some of these soils have an albm horizon whmh is characteristm of solodic  soils and planosols. In certain parts of the landscape one also finds soils of  alluvial origin which are relatively weakly developed.  Nodules, shown to be phosphatic, were found and studmd in one of the  latter soil profiles (Fluvent). On the other hand, dark sesquloxldic segrega-  tions, usually considered to be ferri-manganlferous in mlcromorphological  descriptions, were studmd m samples from soils with an alblc horizon (a  Natraqualf, a Natrustalf and an Arglalboll).  These pedologlcal features were studied by optical and electron micros-  copy of both massive samples and thm sections of the soils. The submicro-  scopic analyses were made with a wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectrometer  (WDXRA) attached to a scanning electron microscope, SEM (Camebax).  With this instrument it is possible to make morphological observatmns as  well as semi-quantitative elemental analyses in the form of elemental distri-  bution images, concentration profiles (traverses) and point-analyses. Some  SEM-observatmns were made also with a JEOL~IEM 32 instrument.    RESULTS AND DISCUSSION    Charactensation of phosphatic nodules in the alluvial soil    Macroscopic examination of this soil had revealed yellowish-white nod-  ules ca. 2 mm m diameter which resemble certain kinds of calcareous nod-  ules in appearance. However, two things led one to suspect that the nodules  have a different composition.  Firstly, chemical analysis of the soil showed an abnormally large phospho-  rus content -- both total and extractable (Olsen's P). In Table I one can  compare the values obtained for this soil (profile 10) with those for a Nat-    TABLE I    Total and extractable phosphorus contents for the Fluvent and Natrustalf (P~O~, ~g/g  dry soil)  Profile         Horizon   Total P    Extractable P  No. 10         A1         25,000     20,600  (Fluvent)      IIC         1,500      1,200  No. 79          A1             250          34  (Natrustalf)    B3            500         32    189    rustalf typical of this region (profile 79). Secondly, examination of soil  thin sections revealed features which, from their morphology, orange colour  in plain light and isotropy in polansed light, resemble phosphatic material  of biological origin seen in other softs (Morris, 1978a).  Therefore, discrete nodules m this profile were separated into two groups  depending on the state of their surfaces: (1) generally smooth surface, (2)  rougher surface and of a more altered appearance.

In co~-  trast, the nodules of the second group contain numerou~ agg~egate~ in tl~  form of small pellets (Fig. 2), developed on a similar framework Lo that seell  m the preceding nodules This morphology could resulL from the alteration  of the original bone tissue, with concomitant formation ~,f minerals of dif-  ferent composition  In addltmn to morphologmal evldem'e, whmh already indicated origin and  composition of these soft nodules, preliminary microprobe analyses con-  firmed the predominance of phosphorus and calcmm, accompanied by lesser  amounts of silicon, alummmm, potassium and magnesium. Analyses by  WDXRA caused significant damage to the analysed nodules, making quanti-  tative analysis difficult, use of an energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS)  should overcome this problem    Charactertsatton of sesquioxzde segregatzons in the solodzc sods and the  planosols    Optical microscopic examination of these soils showed the presence of  sesquloxldes both in the form of glaebules (nodules, concretions) and as  cutans. In transmitted light these features are, in general, dark brown, some-  times with a reddish tint, suggesting a basically manganlferous composition  with, perhaps, some iron.  The distribution and morphological nature of these features differs, de-  pending on the horizon under consideration, in the A1 horizons sesqul  oxides are rare or absent, but in the lower par~ of the A2 they arc present    Fig. 3  Mangamferous coating (todorokite 9) on the surface of a soil aggregate from an  Arglalboll.

Secondary electron image of a sesqmoxidm neocutan in a soil thin section from an  Arglalboll    191    in some cutans; in the upper part of the B horizon they are common and  in the form of cutans, neocutans and irregularly shaped nodules, whereas  in the middle and lower parts of the B horizon they are found mainly as  irregular or, more rarely, rounded nodules.  Observation by SEM of undisturbed soil aggregates showed that the ses-  quioxlde coats have a specific morphology. They are characterised by the  development of reticulated platelets which project from the sample surface  (Fig. 3). This crystal habit has been described often for todoroklte (a com-  plex manganiferous material) (Aubry and Pomerol, 1976).  In addition, microanalysis of some sesquioxidic cutans and neocutans  has delimited their composition more precisely. For example, the secondary  electron image of one such cutan is seen in Fig. 4. In the greyish matrix, fine  veins of darker hue stand out, which can be taken to indicate the separation    of a particular element or phase.    Fig. 5.

Iron (Fig. 5c)appears to be associated with the tim,  fraction of the soil, with a concentration layer towards the aggregate surface,  associated with some of the clay domains In contrast, manganese (Fig 5dp  is clearly concentrated m the dark veins mentioned above.  On the other hand, traverses with the microprobe ot a sfitaxgillan, an  argfllan plus sesqmoxldes and a neosesquan (Figs 6 and 7) show both the  segregation of iron and manganese and the greater proportion of the latter  In the non-oriented regions of the slltargillan, iron, associated with clay,  seems to be more abundant than manganese, m contrast, m the oriented clay  (which IS illustrated by the multiple peaks of S1, A1, K and Fe) with secon-  dary sesquioxlde staining, manganese appears to be domlnani.  The analyses show that manganese is the principal component of, and is  almost solely confined to, the more abundant, dark sesqmoxlde accumula-  tions, whilst iron is confined to the rarer reddish pockets. The results agree  with those of other writers who also estabhshed the separation of ferrug-  lnous and manganiferous phases, as well as the lack of correlation between  the contents of the two elements in concretmns, in different kinds of soils  {e.g. Childs, 1975; Chflds and Leslie, 1977).  Thus, from these results, it seem~ possible to refer that the physico-  chemical conditmns m these solodlsed solonetzes and planosols favour the  mobllisation and segregation of manganese to the exclusion of iron. The  latter must remain Immobile and eventually migrate in association with the  other soil components such as clay and orgamc matter  In this context, it is worth remembering that manganese compounds are  much more readily reduced, and thus more susceptible to mobfllsation than  iron compounds (Van Schuylenborgh,  1973). Consequently, this may  signify that, in the profiles studmd, extreme reducing condmons do not occur    Fig 6.

Conversely, a larger oxidation potential or the typical high pH of these  sodic soils, may provide the Eh--pH conditions necessary for the precipita-  tion and accumulation of manganese.  Further analyses should enable one both to complete this mvestigation  and refine the mitlal interpretations, by attempting to relate more closely  the chemical and mineralogical nature of these manganiferous accumulations  to the conditions necessary for their genesis.    CONCLUSIONS    In this work, the utilisation of SEM and WDXRA techniques helped to  clarify two particular problems. Firstly, it was possible to estabhsh the  phosphatic composition of some nodules found in alluvial soils and to iden-  tify them as small bone fragments whmh are undergoing alteration. Secondly,  sesquioxidm concentrations m some surface hydromorphm soils were shown  to be composed almost exclusively of manganese, while iron is absent or  scarce.    194    In this respect, the two cases discussed here exemplify the posslblhtle~  offered by submicroscopic techniques for the clarification of numerous  problems (frequently impossible to resolve by other means), as well a~  opening up new avenues of research The pursuit of these studies of the  softs of the "Chaco Depnmido" has, m thls way, resulted In a more sure and  a more detailed understanding of their chemical and mineralogical charac-  teristms, assisting as it does in defining the pedogenlc mechanisms which  have participated in the evolution of the different kinds of soils of thls  regmn.
