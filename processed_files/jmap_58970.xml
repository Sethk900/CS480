Predicting Soil CO2 Dynamics in Arable Land of Andisol Using the SOILCO2 ModelAbstractRecently, carbon capture and storage by soils is recognized as an important function of agricultural fields. When discussing global warming mitigation such as proper agricultural practices and/or an appropriate depth of composting in agricultural lands for soil carbon storage, not only CO2 efflux, but also profiles of CO2 concentrations in soil air, are important. This study evaluated the performance of the SOILCO2 model in predicting soil CO2 dynamics, especially CO2 concentrations at various depths in an arable bare land of Andisol. We attempted to experimentally determine two soil parameters required for the CO2 production model, the optimal CO2 production rate and the parameter of a depth-dependent CO2 production function by measuring CO2 efflux from the surface and a vertical distribution of concentration of dissolved organic carbon, respectively. Soil CO2 concentrations, water contents and temperatures were continuously monitored for approximately one year at three different depths, and simulated results were compared with the observed data for model validation. We concluded that, for the upper soil layer (from the surface to approximately 20Â cm in depth), the two soil parameters were properly determined, and soil CO2 dynamics in arable bare land could be well predicted by using the SOILCO2 model. To improve simulation results of CO2 concentrations, especially in deeper layers, it may be necessary to consider the biodegradability of dissolved organic carbon.
