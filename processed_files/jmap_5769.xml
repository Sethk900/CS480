Detection of West Nile Viral RNA from an Overwintering Pool of <I>Culex pipens pipiens</I> (Diptera: Culicidae) in New Jersey, 2003In total, 1,324 Culex pipiens pipiens L. female mosquitoes were collected at Ft. Hancock, Monmouth County, New Jersey, from January to March 2001–2003. Mosquitoes were held in an insectary at 27°C and a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) h for 6 to 21 d after which they were tested in 34 pools. West Nile viral RNA was detected in one pool by a TaqMan reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay; however, infectious virus could not be isolated using either Vero cell plaque assay or C6/36 mosquito cells. Twenty females dissected in January and March 2003 confirmed ovarian diapause status. We suggest that the mode of infection in this pool of overwintering females may have been due to vertical (transgenerational) transmission.
