Plants link above- and belowground subsystems, and our results suggest that their phylogenetic relationships leave a â€œfingerprintâ€ on belowground communities. We found that after correcting for evolutionary history, tree species identity influenced belowground arthropod communities through plant functional traits. These data suggest that plant species structure may be an important predictor in shaping associated soil arthropod communities and further suggest the importance of better understanding the extended consequences of evolutionary history on ecological processes, as similarity in traits may not always reflect similar ecology.  Plant species influence belowground communities in a variety of ways, ultimately impacting nutrient cycling. Functional plant traits provide a means whereby species identity can influence belowground community interactions, but little work has examined whether species identity influences belowground community processes when correcting for evolutionary history. Specifically, we hypothesized that closely related species would exhibit (i) more similar leaf and root functional traits than more distantly related species, and (ii) more similar associated soil arthropod communities. We found that after correcting for evolutionary history, tree species identity influenced belowground arthropod communities through plant functional traits. These data suggest that plant species structure may be an important predictor in shaping associated soil arthropod communities and further suggest the importance of better understanding the extended consequences of evolutionary history on ecological processes, as similarity in traits may not always reflect similar ecology.  Global biodiversity loss is occurring at unprecedented rates ( Pimm  et al . 1995 ;  Sala  et al . 2000 ) in response to a variety of human alterations to the environment ( Vitousek 1994 ;  Vitousek  et al . 1997 ;  Chapin  et al . 2000 ), making understanding the consequences of such loss on community and ecosystem function a top priority. Much attention has been given to understanding the effects of biodiversity aboveground, with particular emphasis on the relationship between species diversity and primary productivity ( Tilman 1996 ;  Hooper and Vitousek 1997 ;  Hector  et al . 1999 ;  Tilman  et al . 2001 ). While these studies have undeniably improved our understanding of the effects of biodiversity, it is equally important to consider how aboveground biodiversity affects the diversity and function of belowground communities, and to understand how above- and belowground communities interact to influence community and ecosystem processes. Interest in the effects of plant species diversity on belowground soil organisms and the soil food web is growing ( Kowalchuk  et al . 2002 ;  Wardle  et al . 2003 ;  De Deyn  et al . 2004 ;  Eisenhauer  et al . 2010 ); however, the interactions among plant species identity and diversity and belowground communities are not well understood ( Wardle 2002 ;  Hooper  et al . 2005 ). Plant species influence belowground communities in a variety of ways including the amount of organic matter returned to the soil and the chemical composition of litter ( Wardle 2002 ;  Wardle  et al . 2004 ), ultimately impacting nutrient cycling. Further understanding of the relationships between species identity and diversity aboveground and community properties and processes belowground is needed to fully understand the consequences of biodiversity loss and to identify the mechanisms of diversity effects.  Functional plant traits provide a means whereby aboveground processes can influence belowground interactions. For example, species-level differences in leaf and root functional traits strongly influence the quality of plant litter inputs to the belowground subsystem, which subsequently impacts microbial communities and associated food web dynamics ( Wardle and Lavelle 1997 ). Using a plant removal design in a grassland system,  Wardle  et al . (1999)  found that while larger soil-decomposing animals (i.e. earthworms) were not affected by plant community composition, there were significant responses to the removal treatments at finer taxonomic levels. These organisms were presumably responding to shifts in functional traits rather than species composition, per se. Additionally, tree species in species-rich temperate and tropical forests may possess distinct soil faunal communities ( Kaneko  et al . 2005 ;  Donoso  et al . 2010 ;  Novotny  et al . 2010 ), despite the homogenizing effect of decomposition processes on the soil and litter environment. For example,  Donoso  et al . (2010)  found that 12.5â€“33.3 % of focal species were specialists on certain tree species, presumably due to variation in the ability of tree species to modify leaf litter through differences in functional traits. Thus, abovegroundâ€“belowground connections are common; however, the relationships among plant functional traits, plant species identity and soil biota remain unclear.  Using long-term common gardens planted with a variety of eastern North American tree species, our study aims to determine whether tree species identity has ecological consequences for associated belowground communities when correcting for evolutionary history, and to identify the role of plant functional traits as a mechanism for driving soil community differences. Specifically, we hypothesized that after correcting for evolutionary history, closely related species would exhibit (i) more similar leaf and root functional traits than more distantly related species, and (ii) more similar associated soil arthropod communities. We measured plant functional traits above- and belowground, and characterized soil arthropod communities of five tree species that are widespread across the eastern United States. Our results indicate that when correcting for evolutionary history, species identity influences belowground arthropod communities via functional similarity. We speculate that phylogenetic conservatism of functional traits may be playing a role in determining belowground arthropod community assemblages.  To determine whether tree species identity governs functional traits and associated belowground community composition, we studied monocultures of five tree species located at Norris Dam State Park, Tennessee, USA (36.23960Â°N, 84.10944Â°W). On a floodplain adjoining the Clinch River, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) previously established experimental forestry plots of several native trees for a hardwood tree improvement programme in the 1960s (specific details unknown by TVA). The plots consisted of âˆ¼25â€“50 trees per species with trees spaced equally every 3 m; additional woody species were not present in the plots. Plots are underlain by cherty silt loam ( Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey ) and are arranged randomly along the adjacent riparian area (âˆ¼45 m from the river). The tree species we sampled included  Quercus alba  (white oak),  Quercus prinus  (chestnut oak),  Juglans nigra  (black walnut),  Ilex opaca  (American holly) and  Liriodendron tulipifera  (tulip-poplar). These species represent three plant orders (Magnoliales, Fagales and Aquifoliales) and four families (Aquifoliaceae, Fagaceae, Juglandaceae and Magnoliaceae) with varying degrees of relatedness.  To examine the hypothesis that after correcting for evolutionary history, more closely related tree species had similar functional traits and soil communities, five randomly chosen individual trees were sampled from each plot. Three randomly selected and fully expanded leaves from terminal shoots at the mid-canopy level were collected with pole pruners, and âˆ¼25 cm of root within a 50-cm radius around each tree were collected and stored at 4 Â°C until analysis. We measured two different functional traits: specific leaf area (SLA) and specific root area (SRA). Specific leaf area is an indicator of potential relative growth rate, gives an indication of investment in leaf structural defence, and typically correlates positively with resource availability ( Cornelissen  et al . 2003 ). Specific root area is strongly correlated with absorptive activity by the root biomass ( Cornelissen  et al . 2003 ). To determine SLA (foliar area : mass ratio), leaf area was measured via WinFOLIA (Regent Instruments, Toronto, Canada) and leaves were oven dried at 70 Â°F for 48 h and the oven-dried leaf mass was recorded. To determine SRA, roots were rinsed with deionized water and then scanned for root surface area and root volume via WinFOLIA software (Regent Instruments). To account for differences in root size between species, we calculated the SRA by dividing the root surface area by root volume.  To characterize soil communities, we collected two 5-cm-diameter soil core samples from the organic layer (unconsolidated organic matter mixed with mineral soil). Soil cores (to a depth of 10 cm) were taken from two opposite sides of the tree âˆ¼1 m from the base of each focal tree. Soil pH (measured in deionized water with a Denver Instruments model 220 pH meter) and soil temperature (soil thermometer at 15 cm depth) were also recorded; however, temperature did not vary among species plots (15.5 Â°C). The collected soil was stored in a cooler during transport and at 4 Â°C until analysis. Soils were then sieved (4 mm mesh). The soil from one core was used to determine extracellular enzyme activity and total carbon (C) while the other was used to analyse soil arthropod communities. Arthropods were extracted from soil over 72 h using the Berlese funnel method ( Macfadyen 1961 ). We used a dissection microscope to classify arthropods to order.  We measured potential extracellular enzyme activity of C-degrading enzymes in soil to assess soil quality and microbial activity within the belowground communities. Approximately 1 g of soil, sieved to 2 mm, was analysed for potential activity of Î±-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20) and Î²-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21); 1.0 g of soil was extracted with 50 mmol L âˆ’1  sodium acetate buffer, pH 6. Both extracellular enzymes are secreted by soil microbes, and can be used as indicators of soil quality; Î±-glucosidase degrades starch and Î²-glucosidase oxidizes cellulose. We used methyl-umbelliferone (MUB) as a fluorometric substrate in eight analytical replicates that were incubated for 2 h each; activity was measured on a Synergy HT microplate reader ( Sinsabaugh 1994 ; BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). Potential Î±-glucosidase enzyme activity levels &gt;100 nmol g âˆ’1  h âˆ’1  were discarded, as they were extreme outliers.  Organic matter was removed by the loss-on-ignition technique ( Ball 1964 ) by ashing in a muffle furnace at 550 Â°C for at least 6 h. Organic matter is measured as the difference in mass before and after combustion in the muffle furnace. Soil organic carbon (SOC) was calculated as 28.4 % of organic matter ( Donkin 1991 ). A subsample of each soil was also oven dried at 105 Â°C for 48 h to determine soil water content; all final data are reported on an oven-dried mass basis.  We used a phylogeny with branch lengths based on a neutral molecular clock for the five tree species (J. Beaulieu, unpubl. data) to create a pairwise phylogenetic distance matrix (R 2.14.1, ape package). We generated a pairwise distance matrix of the species means of SLA and SRA of the trees. We also generated a pairwise dissimilarity matrix for the soil arthropod community associated with each tree species in monoculture by aggregating the arthropod communities by host tree species, doubly standardizing the aggregated values using Wisconsin standardization, and then calculating the Brayâ€“Curtis dissimilarity between each pair of communities (R 2.14.1, vegan package). Finally, we calculated the pairwise distance between the means of each of the soil properties of each tree species (Î±-glucosidase, Î²-glucosidase, total SOC and pH).  We ran Mantel autocorrelation tests with 9999 permutations (R 2.14.1, ade4 package) to determine whether closely related species shared more similar functional trait values than expected by chance and to determine whether pairwise phylogenetic distances between tree species were correlated with either arthropod community similarity or soil properties. In addition, we calculated the Mantel correlation between all pairs of soil property and functional trait distance matrices, including soil pH, SOC, SLA and SRA.  To infer potential mechanisms for the effect of host tree phylogeny on soil arthropod communities, we employed a structural equation modelling approach ( Fox 2006 ;  Grace 2006 ). We used Mantel correlations between pairwise matrices of host tree phylogenetic distances, pairwise root and leaf trait distances, and soil arthropod community Brayâ€“Curtis dissimilarities to create a correlation matrix, which we used to estimate the parameters of the structural equation models that we specified, following the procedure of  Leduc  et al . (1992)  and  Meneses  et al . (2012) . We selected the models with the lowest Akaike's corrected (AICc) and Bayesian (BIC) information criteria. Modelling was done in R 2.14.1 (sem package).

Arrows are labelled with the appropriate path coefficient.  Our results demonstrate that after evolutionary history is accounted for, individual tree species support similar communities through conservatism of functional traits. We show that closely related tree species trend toward more similar leaf and root functional traits and soil arthropod communities in comparison to more distantly related species. While previous studies have shown that soil moisture and plot location can affect soil arthropod communities ( Luptacik  et al . 2012 ), our study controlled these two variables through the use of monoculture plots randomly positioned along a common riparian area with similar soil type and consistent temperature. Our study is the first to our knowledge to examine the effect of host tree identity on soil arthropod community composition, with evolutionary history accounted for; however, similar positive relationships exist for canopy arthropod communities ( Novotny  et al . 2006 ).  Bottom-up forces exert strong control on soil communities through altering resource availability. Detritivores consume dead plant matter and mobilize nutrients, making resources available to the living plant ( SetÃ¤lÃ¤ 2005 ). The quantity and quality of organic matter entering the soil subsystem is the primary driver of belowground community structure and function, with fast-growing, short-lived plant tissue promoting bacteria and macroinvertebrates such as earthworms, and slow-growing, long-lived plant tissue promoting fungi and microarthropods such as mites ( Wardle  et al . 2004 ;  Bardgett and Wardle 2010 ). Because SLA and SRA, traits that are correlated with plant growth rate and patterns of C allocation ( DÃ­az  et al . 2004 ), were conserved across species, after accounting for evolutionary history, we expected to see soil properties associated with detrital C processing vary in response to species. Although we found correlations between plant species and the soil community, those effects did not impact soil properties, which could result from the dilution of the effect of litter identity by arthropod processing. Before leaves and other detritus are processed by microbes they are broken down by soil arthropods into smaller fragments to harvest energy and nutrients, causing properties of organic matter originating from different plant species to converge in size and chemistry after it is processed by arthropods ( Preston  et al . 2009 ;  Moore  et al . 2011 ). Thus, processing reduces the effect of litter identity, which may be why we found no correlation between C dynamics and tree relatedness. In addition, the lack of observed trait conservatism may be because soil arthropod community composition was analysed at a coarse taxonomic resolution (order), and few tree species were sampled, relative to previous studies ( Pokon  et al . 2005 ;  Novotny  et al . 2006 ).  Plants link above- and belowground subsystems, and their phylogenetic relationships may leave a â€˜fingerprintâ€™ on belowground communities. With biodiversity declining rapidly ( Pimm  et al . 1995 ), it is important to fully understand how species identity aboveground may influence the properties and processes of the belowground system in order to be able to predict how the loss of diversity will affect the functioning of communities and ecosystems. Future studies should particularly focus on functional traits that are conserved across phylogenies. Experimental studies that manipulate tree species identity, with multiple levels of phylogenetic composition or diversity, and measure the response of the soil arthropod community would be especially useful. A mechanistic approach grounded in functional traits and phylogenetic relationships will improve our ability to understand and predict the cascading effects of species loss aboveground on belowground communities and processes. While from a small study, the data reported here suggest important above-/belowground linkages among functional traits and associated communities reflecting past evolutionary history. Studies such as this are critical to bolstering our understanding of the genetic linkages among species and the consequences for community assembly and ecosystem processes.
