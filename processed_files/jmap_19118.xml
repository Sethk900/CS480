Carbon sequestration in a temperate grassland; management and climatic controlsSoil management practices that result in increased soil carbon (C) sequestration can make a valuable contribution to reducing the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We studied the effect of poultry manure, cattle slurry, sewage sludge, NH4NO3 or urea on C cycling and sequestration in silage grass production. Soil respiration, net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and methane (CH4) fluxes were measured with chambers, and soil samples were analysed for total C and dissolved organic C (DOC). Treatments were applied over 2 years and measurements were carried out over 3 years to assess possible residual effects. Organic fertilizer applications increased CO2 loss through soil respiration but also enhanced soil C storage compared with mineral fertilizer. Cumulative soil respiration rates were highest in poultry manure treatments with 13.7 t C ha(-1) in 2003, corresponding to 1.6 times the control value, but no residual effect was seen. Soil respiration showed an exponential increase with temperature, and a bimodal relationship with soil moisture. The greatest NEE was observed on urea treatments (with a CO2 uptake of -4.4 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1)). Total C and DOC were significantly greater in manure treatments in the soil surface (0-10 cm). Of the C added in the manures, 27% of that in the sewage pellets, 32% of that in the cattle slurry and 39% of that in the poultry manure remained in the 0-10 cm soil layer at the end of the experiment. Mineral fertilizer treatments had only small C sequestration rates, although uncertainties were high. Expressed as global warming potentials, the benefits of increased C sequestration on poultry manure and sewage pellet treatments were outweighed by the additional losses of N2O, particularly in the wet year 2002. Methane was emitted only for 2-3 days on cattle slurry treatments, but the magnitudes of fluxes were negligible compared with C losses by soil respiration.
