Immature stages of Chinavia musiva (Berg, 1878): a unique pattern in the morphology of Chinavia Orian, 1965 (Hemiptera, Pentatomidae)Specimens of Chinavia musiva were collected in Parque Estadual do Espinilho (Barra do QuaraÃ­ County, RS, Brazil). Insects were reared under controlled conditions (24Â±1Â°C; RH 70Â±10%; 12h L:12h D), and fed on green beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Eggs of C. musiva differ from the pattern observed in other species of the genus due to chorion colour and surface, and aeroâ€micropylar processes, number and shape. Exclusive features of the species in the nymphal stage are head and thorax dull; variegated pattern of abdomen, and openings of the scent glands in conspicuous tubercles. Developmental time was, on average, 52 days; females laid more frequently egg masses with 14 or 42 eggs. Females collected from the field as nymphs exhibited higher reproductive performance than females reared on green beans as nymphs and adults, suggesting that wild hosts could be essential for the species life cycle. 1.
