Predatory behaviour in Deltochilum: convergent evolution or a primitive character within a clade?We present data on predatory behaviour in Deltochilum cupreicolle viridescens, which belongs to the subgenus Aganhyboma, and we contrast it with the behaviour of a species from the subgenus Deltohyboma. By this comparison we can investigate whether the predatory behaviour in Deltochilum could have appeared independently in these two subgenera, or if the behaviour is so similar that it suggests a single origin in a possible ancestor exclusive to those two groups. These laboratory studies on the behaviour of Deltochilum c. viridescens individuals on diplopods are described and divided into the following stages: (1) approach and recognition of the diplopod; (2) attack and death of the prey; (3) on-site feeding; (4) transport of the diplopod. The results found here strengthen the hypothesis of a primitive and highly specialized behaviour within a possible clade formed by the predatory species of Diplopoda.
