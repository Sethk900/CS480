Transport and Deposition of Suspended Soil Colloids in Saturated Sand ColumnsUnderstanding colloid mobilization, transport, and deposition in the subsurface is a prerequisite for predicting colloid-facilitated transport of strongly adsorbing contaminants and further developing remedial activities. This study investigated the transport behavior of soil-colloids extracted from a red-yellow soil from Okinawa, Japan. Different concentrations of suspended-soil colloids (with diameter <1  μm) were applied, at different flow velocities and pH conditions, to 10-cm long water-saturated columns repacked with either Narita (mean diameter D50=0.64  mm) or Toyoura (mean diameter D50=0.21  mm) sands. The transport and retention of colloids were studied by analyzing colloid effluent breakthrough curves (BTCs), particle size distribution in the effluent, and colloid deposition profiles within the column. The results showed a significant influence of flow velocity: Low flow velocity caused tailing of colloid BTCs with higher reversible entrapment and release of colloids than high flow velocity. The finer Toyoura sand retained more colloids than the coarser Narita sand at low pH conditions. The deposition profile and particle size distribution of colloids in the Toyoura sand clearly indicated a depth-dependent straining mechanism. By fitting colloid transport models (one-site and two-site models) to the colloid effluent breakthrough curves, transport and deposition of colloids in Narita sand at low pH were best described by a one-site attachment-detachment model, whereas colloid transport and deposition in Toyoura sand at low pH were better captured by a two-site attachment, detachment, and straining model. The coupled effects of solution chemistry, colloid sizes, and medium surface properties have a dominating role in particle-particle and particle-collector interactions in colloid transport and deposition.
