Two new genera and species of the termite symbiont lineage Termitohospitini (Coleoptera, Staphylinidae, Aleocharinae) from Bolivia and peninsular MalaysiaAbstract Coptotermocola clavicornis gen. & sp. n. and Neotermitosocius bolivianus gen. & sp. n. of the termite inquilinous tribe Termitohospitini are described from peninsular Malaysia and Bolivia, respectively. The Termitohospitini are most readily diagnosable by the distally migrated anterior tentorial pits that are no longer associated with the antennal fossae, and by the enlarged vertex which obscures the antennal fossae dorsally. Additionally, the Termitohospitini are hypothesized to share a recent common ancestor with the Masuriini and Myllaenini due to shared derived morphologies of the lacinia distal teeth with lateral cuticular processes, presence of a unique maxillary palpomere III sensilla, and anterolateral angles of mentum produced. Habitus photographs and illustrations of diagnostic features are provided for the two new genera in order to facilitate future work.
