Genotype × environment interaction and principal factor analysis of seed characteristics related to canning quality of small white beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in South AfricaAnalysis of variance, correlation analysis and principal factor analysis were applied to data for 23 sensory and physico-chemical traits measured on five cultivars of small white canning beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) planted at five localities in the 1995–96 season. Trait expression was strongly influenced by genotype × environment interactions, with the exception of the processed bean colour and the subjective evaluations of colour and splits. Non-significant main effects and interactions of processed colour showed that since small white beans are canned in tomato sauce in South Africa, colour analysis could be excluded from the canning quality evaluations. The principal factor analysis identified seven different factors. They were seed size, dry colour, processed colour, visual appearance, texture, water absorption and the red colour of the processed beans. Four different factors remained after exclusion of the colour of the dry and processed beans. They were seed size, water absorption, visual appearance and texture. These tests were successful in differentiating canning quality among test samples and can be used to determine canned bean quaiity of dry beans.
