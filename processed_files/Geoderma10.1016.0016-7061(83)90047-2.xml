 356    The paper discussing the effects of drainage on the behavior of peat  softs is of interest to peatland developers. The causes of subsidence related  to water levels, type of crops grown, management and mechanization were  discussed and detailed data given.  In the section on land use, uses of peatlands for both agriculture and  urban developments were discussed. The principal agricultural use of these  lands is for grass production. The paper on urban uses of peatlands dis-  cussed the problems with building foundations, road construction and  recreation area developments.  The most extensive reclamation efforts in Holland as reported in this  publication took place in the Holland--Utrecht lowland plain roughly  bounded by Amsterdam, Utrecht and Rotterdam near where the Rhine  and Meuse rivers flow to the North Sea.  The reviewer of the papers about soils stated that only the Dutch and  Polish systems for classification of organic soil distinguish between natural  undrained peat soils and the drained peat soils subject to oxidation. The  U.S. Soil Taxonomy does not account for altered organic soils in his opin-  ion.  The proceedings are valuable in that the long experience of the Dutch  in developing their peatlands, including all the problems they encountered,  should greatly contribute to the development of peatland areas in other  parts of the world. This publication should be of interest to peat scien-  tists, horticulturists, agronomists and land use planners.    R.S. FARNHAM  (St. Paul, Minn.)    Soil Conservation --Problems and Prospects. R.P.C. Morgan (Editor). John  Wiley, Chichester, 1981, xvi + 576 pp., 22.00.    This book is a collection of papers presented at an International Confer-  ence on Soft Conservation held in Silsoe, United Kingdom in July 1980.  The 42 papers presented include contributions from most areas of the world  with soil conservation problems, including China and U.S.S.R.  Four major aspects are explored: land classification and erosion assess-  ment for conservation design, preventative and control measures, erosion  models and economic, social and legal aspects. Of particular note in the  modelling sections, is a number of papers describing the progress made  in developing models based on sounder physical principles than those con-  sidered in the Universal Soil Loss Equation, which will allow in future con-  servation practices to be included. The volume provides a useful up-to-date  assessment of the current position in soil conservation research, develop-  ment and field application, and will be of particular interest to those con-  cerned with soil erosion evaluation and soil conservation practice.
