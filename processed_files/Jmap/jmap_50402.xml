Genomic organization of repetitive DNAs and its implications for male karyotype and the neo-Y chromosome differentiation in Erythrinus erythrinus (Characiformes, Erythrinidae)Abstract Studies have demonstrated the effective participation of repetitive DNA sequences in the origin and differentiation of the sex chromosomes in some biological groups. In this study several microsatellites and retrotranposable sequences were cytogenetically mapped in the Erythrinus erythrinus (Bloch & Schneider, 1801) male genome (karyomorph C), focusing on the distribution of these sequences in the sex chromosomes and in the evolutionary processes related to their differentiation. Males of E. erythrinus – karyomorph C – present 2n = 51 chromosomes (7m + 2sm + 6st + 36a), including the X1X2Y sex chromosomes. The C-positive heterochromatin has a predominant localization on the centromeric region of most chromosome pairs, but also in some telomeric regions. The 5S rDNA sites are located in the centromeric region of 27 chromosomes, including 26 acrocentric ones and the metacentric Y chromosome. The retrotransposons Rex 1 and Rex 6 show a dispersed pattern in the karyotype, contrasting with the Rex 3 distribution which is clearly co-localized with all the 27 5S rDNA sites. The microsatellite sequences show a differential distribution, some of them restricted to telomeric and/or interstitial regions and others with a scattered distribution on the chromosomes. However, no preferential accumulation of these elements were observed in the neo-Y chromosome, in contrast to what usually occurs in simple sex chromosome systems.
