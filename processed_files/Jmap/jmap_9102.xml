Burning and Grazing Management in a California Grassland: Growth, Mortality, and Recruitment of Nassella pulchraAnnual grasslands in California are often managed with seasonal grazing and prescribed burning on the assumption that such practices have long-term benefits for native species. Mature native perennial bunchgrasses, particularly Nassella pulchra (purple needlegrass), are often the focal species, although very little is known about responses at different life history stages. Thus, important questions remain about long-term population dynamics of both mature plants and seedling recruitment. In plots receiving repeated grazing and burning events over 7 years, mortality of mature plants was threefold higher on mounds than on intermounds and likely reflected increased competition intensity associated with increased resource availability in deeper soil. Burning and grazing treatments had strong positive effects on basal area of mature N. pulchra. However, plants in grazed plots that were not burned contained considerable standing dead biomass. Topographic location strongly influenced growth as intermound plants grew relatively more than mound plants, but the effects on growth of burning and grazing did not vary with topographic location. In mapped plots N. pulchra recruitment was very low, and overall density dropped an average of 31%. However, a significant time-by-burning effect indicated that survival was significantly higher in burned plots. After 7 years of repeated treatments, effects of burning and grazing management on mature N. pulchra were positive but not for all phenological stages. Understanding long-term influence of management on bunchgrass populations may not be easy to determine because short-term results may not reflect long-term responses and some life cycle dynamics may be observed only over very long periods.
