Water chemistry and effect of evapotranspiration on chemical sedimentation on the Mkuze River floodplain, South Africa.The Mkuze Wetland System, forming part of the iSimangaliso World Heritage Site, is South Africa's largest freshwater wetland area and is known to act as a sink for naturally occurring solutes within the landscape. The chemistry of groundwater and porewater samples, collected from two transects on the Mkuze River floodplain, was investigated to identify processes involved in the control of solute concentrations. Results show that solutes in the groundwater become increasingly concentrated under the influence of evapotranspiration, resulting in the saturation, precipitation, and accumulation of less soluble compounds. Trends in porewater chemistry and calculated saturation indices support previously documented mineralogical and sediment geochemical investigations, with CaCO3 and silica precipitation, and Fe-rich smectite neoformation identified as the major controls on solute concentration. The association of these mineral phases with zones of high salinity suggests that mineral precipitation is an active process on the floodplain which results in the progressive development of salinity, particularly in areas dominated by deep-rooted trees. Similarities between geochemical processes documented in the Okavango Delta (Botswana) and those identified in this study suggest that evapotranspiration-induced chemical sedimentation is an important process in southern African wetlands, which has the potential to influence vegetation distribution, hydrological flows, and local topography.
