Comparative investigation of the late embryogenesis of Leptodora kindtii (Focke, 1844) (Crustacea: Branchiopoda), with notes on types of embryonic development and larvae in CladoceraThe embryonic development of the parthenogenetic eggs of Leptodora kindtii has been investigated by observing living embryos removed from the female brood pouch. The sequence of morphological changes was analysed, as was the time at which the activity of certain organs began. The timing of these events at 20â€“22Â°C is documented. These data were compared with similar information obtained for some representatives of Ctenopoda and Anomopoda. The sequence of appearance of rudiments of organs on the ventral side of the embryos is similar in all these groups but the timing of shedding of the embryonic membranes differs. Hatching from the inner egg membranes takes place at the late metanauplius stage in Leptodora as in Ctenopoda and Cyclestherida, while in Anomopoda this stage is embryonized. The development of Leptodora is more like that of Ctenopoda than of Anomopoda. The embryos of all the aboveâ€mentioned groups begin to grow at approximately the same morphological stage. A new scheme for the periodization of the embryogenesis of L. kindtii is proposed, which includes four wellâ€separated stages. Previously, the same number of developmental stages has been reported for Ctenopoda and Anomopoda. In Leptodora, as well as in Ctenopoda, the first two of these occur within the egg membranes. Cyclestheria has at least one embryonic moult and one embryonic stage more than Leptodora and other cladocerans. Embryonic stages 3 and 4 of the parthenogenetic eggs of L. kindtii represent a peculiar type of secondary larvae developing inside the female's brood pouch. The appearance of a freeâ€living nauplius in L. kindtii arises from its mode of hatching from the gamogenetic egg.
