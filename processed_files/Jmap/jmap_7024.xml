Contribuci√≥n al conocimiento de la alimentaci√≥n de larvas de la rana criolla Leptodactylus ocellatus (Amphibia, Leptodactylidae) en el Paran√° medio, ArgentinaThe object of this work was to analyse in a quali‚Äquantitative way the composition of tadpoles‚Äô diet of Leptodactylus ocellatus by studying the content of their intestines. Twenty digestive tubes were individually analyzed. Their content of feeding items was identified and quantified applying Lackey's Drop Microtransect Counting Method (1938). It allowed the calculation of the percentual‚Äsize relation as well as occurrence frequency. The results show that L. ocellatus‚Äô diet is mainly composed of diatoms and green algae, detritus and plant residues.
