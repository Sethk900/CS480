A new quadrannulate species of Orobdella (Hirudinida, Arhynchobdellida, Orobdellidae) from western Honshu, JapanA new quadrannulate species of Orobdella Oka, 1895, Orobdella naraharaetmagarum sp. n., from the mountainous region of western Honshu, Japan is described. Orobdella naraharaetmagarum is a small species with a body length of less than 5 cm. Phylogenetic analyses using nuclear 18S rRNA and histone H3, as well as mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, tRNACys, tRNAMet, 12S rRNA, tRNAVal, 16S rRNA, tRNALeu and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 markers indicated that the present new species is the sister species of the quadrannulate Orobdella esulcata Nakano, 2010. Furthermore, mitochondrial DNA genealogy within O. naraharaetmagarum demonstrated that this new species is divided into eastern and western lineages.
