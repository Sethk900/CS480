Fertilizer placement of maize: I. Grain yield and plant growthNormal fertilizer placement, two deeper than normal, broadcast and no fertilizer treatments were compared in a stubble tillage system in the north-western Free State. Plant growth, as indicated by leaf area, leaf dry mass and stem dry mass, was evaluated at three intervals until flowering during the three growing seasons of 1985/86 to 1987/88. Tillering and grain yield were measured at harvest. The deeper than normal placement of fertilizer gave up to an 11% increase in yield in the drier years (345 mm and 356 mm rainfall) but not in the wetter year (869 mm rainfall). Deeper placement initially resulted in poorer plant growth, but had the best plant growth at flowering. Deeper placement also resulted in less tillering.
