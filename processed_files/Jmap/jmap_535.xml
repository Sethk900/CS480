Response of newly established Juniperus ashei and Carex planostachys plants to barrier-induced water restriction in surface soil.Plant species in the Edwards Plateau region of central Texas often face drought conditions. Some of these species reduce water stress by rooting into moist bedrock crevices. A dominant woody plant (Juniperus ashei) and co-occurring xeric sedge (Carex planostachys) were greenhouse-grown in growth tubes with or without water-blocking partial barriers in tubes with water added below the barrier (~70 cm). Soil moisture at various depths was related to growth response (above- and below-ground biomass, root length, and number of root tips) per species. Barrier treatment yielded significantly drier soil than non-barrier. Juniperus plants were significantly smaller with barrier treatment, while Carex showed no significant differences between treatments. The results suggest the sedge is more able than the shrub to increase root production in the upper layers of the soil when faced with access restriction to lower layers. The sedge may resist drought by exploring sub-superficial soil layers. When access to sub-superficial water sources is restricted, the shrub is more affected than the sedge. The plants' growth in water-restricted surface soil for several months suggests these species may not need deep water to survive. In fact seedling growth may differ in mature plants.
