Oxidation-reduction regimes in some Oxisols of tropical ChinaThe oxidation-reduction regimes of some Oxisols of tropical China were investigated on the basis of the Eh values and the amounts of reducing substances, both measured by newly devised methods. The Eh values in the surface layers of soil profiles under natural forest and commercial forest were 400–550 mV, lower by 100–200 mV than the deeper horizons. The concentrations of reducing substances in the surface layers corresponded to 0.5–5.0 · 10−5M of Mn2+. In the cultivated layer of a submerged paddy soil the concentration of reducing substances was as high as 13·10−5M, with an Eh value of less than 100 mV. There was a negative correlation between the Eh value and the logarithm of the concentration of reducing substances, showing that the intensity aspect and the capacity aspect of the oxidation-reduction status of a soil are closely interrelated.
