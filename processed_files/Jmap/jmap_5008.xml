A new deep-sea benthopelagic chaetognath of the genus Bathyspadella (Chaetognatha) with ecological and molecular phylogenetic remarksA new chaetognath, Bathyspadella oxydentata, collected from Sagami Bay, central Japan, is described. The new species was collected from deep-sea benthopelagic habitat and is distinguished from the closely related species Bathyspadella edentata Tokioka, 1939 by the presence of teeth. The phylogenetic position of the new species was examined by molecular genetic analysis using partial sequences of 18S rRNA and 16S rRNA. Although B. oxydentata shares several morphological features with both Spadellidae and Eukrohnidae, the molecular phylogeny indicates that the new species is closely related to Heterokrohnidae species.
