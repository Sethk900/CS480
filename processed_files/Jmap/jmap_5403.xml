New finding of Mesozoic ephippia of the Anomopoda (Crustacea: Cladocera)Fossil Mesozoic anomopods (Crustacea: Cladocera) have only been found twice previously, although this group apparently differentiated in the Palaeozoic. This paper describes the finding of anomopod ephippia of three different types in the locality Khutelâ€Khara, Mongolia (Lower Cretaceous, 129Â±9Â Mya). This discovery demonstrates once more that the idea of rarity of cladocerans in Mesozoic fossils was motivated by insufficient attention of carcinologists to such fossils.
