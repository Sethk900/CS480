Soil and erosion features of the central plateau region of Tigrai, EthiopiaThe results of reconnaissance soil surveys covering 6,000 km2 are used to describe the Central Plateau region, which lies at elevations of 2,000 to 2,800 m in northern Ethiopia. Landform and soil sequences on calcareous shales, dolerites and sandstones are described, in which the principal soil units are Lithosols, Luvisols, Cambisols, Arenosols and Vertisols. Detailed morphological and analytical data are presented for a profile representative of arable soils in each sequence. Small-scale subsistence cultivation of cereals is the dominant land use; all land which is physically cultivable is at present cultivated. Settlement patterns are closely related to soil type, nucleated settlement occurring on fine textured soils but dispersed settlement on coarser textured and more freely draining soils. Erosion and soil moisture features of the three landforms described were investigated and compared. Empirical methods and suspended sediment measurements indicate high rates of regional soil loss (17–33 t ha−1 yr−1), accounted for by seasonally high rates of rainfall erosivity, steep terrain and poor land use. The recent development of gully erosion is seen to be linked to the disintegration of waterfall tufas. Application of the universal soil loss equation to arable lands indicates potential annual soil losses in the range of 400 t ha−1 on Vertisols to 200 t ha−1 on Cambisols: differences in rates are ascribed principally to differences in crop planting dates, which affect the degree of vegetative protection during periods of high rainfall erosivity. Soil moisture is shown to be in the available range for less than three months in the year. The time at which moisture in the profile enters the available range differed between the three soils monitored and was found to be closely related to the crop planting date, thus indirectly affecting the erosion hazard.
