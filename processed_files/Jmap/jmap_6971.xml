Ephemeroptera from Central and South America: New Species of the Farrodes bimaculatus Group with a Key for the MalesThe genus Farrodes was recently revised, and two species groups were delimited: Farrodes caribbianus and Farrodes bimaculatus. In that paper the species of the F. caribbianus species group were described or redescribed. In the F. bimaculatus species group eight undescribed species were treated but not described. In the present paper, these new species of the F. bimaculatus species group are described and discussed and a key for the separation of all the species known from male imagines in this group is provided.
