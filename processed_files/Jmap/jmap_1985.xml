Nonlinear response of N2O flux to incremental fertilizer addition in a continuous maize (Zea mays L.) cropping system.The relationship between nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) flux and N availability in agricultural ecosystems is usually assumed to be linear, with the same proportion of nitrogen lost as N<sub>2</sub>O regardless of input level. We conducted a 3-year, high-resolution N fertilizer response study in southwest Michigan USA to test the hypothesis that N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes increase mainly in response to N additions that exceed crop N needs. We added urea ammonium nitrate or granular urea at nine levels (0-292 kg N ha<sup>-;1</sup>) to four replicate plots of continuous maize. We measured N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes and available soil N biweekly following fertilization and grain yields at the end of the growing season. From 2001 to 2003 N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes were moderately low (ca. 20 g N<sub>2</sub>O-N ha<sup>-;1</sup> day<sup>-;1</sup>) at levels of N addition to 101 kg N ha<sup>-;1</sup>, where grain yields were maximized, after which fluxes more than doubled (to >50 g N<sub>2</sub>O-N ha<sup>-;1</sup> day<sup>-;1</sup>). This threshold N<sub>2</sub>O response to N fertilization suggests that agricultural N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes could be reduced with no or little yield penalty by reducing N fertilizer inputs to levels that just satisfy crop needs.
