Brief Communication: The use of an unmanned aerial vehicle in a rockfall emergency scenarioIn recent years, the use of unmanned aerial vehi- cles (UAVs) in civilian/commercial contexts are becoming increasingly common, as well as for applications concern- ing anthropic and natural disasters. In this paper, we present the first results of a research project aimed at defining a possible methodology for the use of micro-UAVs in emer- gency scenarios relevant to rockfall phenomena. To develop and support the method presented herein, the results rele- vant to a rockfall emergency occurred on 7 March 2014 in the San Germano municipality (north-western Italy) are pre- sented and discussed.
