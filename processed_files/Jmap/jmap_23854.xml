Temporal trends in the by-catch of loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta in the Mediterranean Sea: Reply to BÃ¡ez et al. (2014)In their comment on Ãlvarez de Quevedo et al. (2013; Mar Ecol Prog Ser 489:225-234), BÃ¡ez et al. (2014; Mar Ecol Prog Ser 504:301-302) argued that the annual loggerhead turtle by-catch by the Spanish longline fleet was actually lower than that reported (6060 vs. 10656 ind.), on the basis of unpublished data on fishing effort collected in 2006-2007. However, the data provided by Ãlvarez de Quevedo et al. (2013) corresponded to the period 2001-2004, hence the different results are not contradictory. Conversely, they are complementary and support the evidence of a decreasing trend in the number of turtles by-caught by the Spanish fleet throughout the last decade.
