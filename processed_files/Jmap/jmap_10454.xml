Salinity-induced growth and some metabolic changes in three Salsola speciesThree Salsola species, Salsola dendroides Pall., S. richteri (Moq.) Karel ex Litw. and S. orientalis S.C. Gmel., were compared for their salt tolerance, inorganic ionic accumulation and their biomass production in saline conditions. Seeds were grown on sterilized quartz under five salinity levels in a factorial experimental design, with four replications, in greenhouse conditions.  With salinity, Na+ accumulation increased while K+ accumulation decreased. All three species showed positive shoot growth for low levels of salinity. Root growth showed almost the same trend as shoot growth, with minor exceptions. At low levels of salinity, proline accumulated more in S. dendroides plant tissues than in the tissues of the other two species. These results suggest that the proline accumulation is a good index for salinity tolerance. Soluble sugars also increased as a result of salinity.
