Concentration, accumulation and uptake rate of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn by wheat under irrigationThe objective of this study was to obtain information on the Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn uptake patterns of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown under normal irrigation farming conditions. Except for irrigation scheduling, the 13 farmers on whose farms the study was conducted were allowed to follow their normal farming practices. At each site biomass production and nutrient content of the top growth were measured regularly throughout the growing season, starting 35–45 days after planting. The concentration of Cu and Zn started to decrease from 40 days after planting, while the concentration of Fe and Mn increased until 50 days after planting and then started to decrease. Accumulation of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn in the whole plant reached a maximum during caryopsis at about 150 days after planting. The maximum accumulation for Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn was 145, 3 984, 934 and 124 g ha−1, respectively. Uptake rates for Cu, Fe and Mn reached a maximum just before anthesis at about 115 days after planting. The maximum uptake rate for Zn occurred just after four leaves were fully unfolded on the main stem at about 75 days after planting. The maximum uptake rates were 2.75, 91.67, 14.67 and 2.18 g ha−1day−1 for Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn, respectively.
