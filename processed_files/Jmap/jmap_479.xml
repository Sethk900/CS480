Nitrogen Mineralization and Leaching in the Early Stages of a Subtropical Reforestation in Southern China.Nitrogen cycling is a critical component in plantations, yet the spatial and temporal variations of N transformations in different stages of reforestation are often poorly known. Here we report the seasonal variation of soil in situ net N mineralization, net nitrification and N leaching in five young plantations (two monocultures of exotic species: <em>Eucalyptus urophylla</em> and <em>Acacia crassicarpa</em>; a native species monoculture; a 10-species mixture and a 30-species mixture) and a shrubland (without experimental planting) in subtropical southern China. Our results show that net N mineralization and nitrification rates in the <em>E. urophylla</em> monoculture (13.5 and 9.98 kg N ha<sup>-;1</sup> yr<sup>-;1</sup>, respectively) were the lowest among six planting treatments, less than 1/3 of those in the 10-species and 30-species mixtures. Two exotic fast-growing monocultures had 10-60% lower soil extractable nitrate concentrations than the native plantations and shrubland and had the lowest nitrogen leaching losses. The leguminous <em>A. crassicarpa</em> monoculture did not have higher soil N availability in comparison with non-leguminous species. Both N mineralization and nitrification varied seasonally; soil moisture seemed to be important in controlling these temporal variations. This study highlights that in the early stages of reforestaion, a better understanding of plant species effects on soil N cycling would be beneficial to forest management decisions and could provide a critical foundation for advancing restoration practices.
