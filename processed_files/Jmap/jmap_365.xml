Reporting Difference for Colored Patagial Tags on Ring-Billed Gulls.The possible role of tag color in mediating behaviors that could bias resighting rate has not been examined. In a study that began in 2007, we marked 725 ring-billed gulls (<em>Larus delawarensis</em>) with Bondcote royal blue, green, yellow, or orange patagial tags. Reports we gathered over 2Â years indicated approximately a 3.4<img src="/na101/home/literatum/publisher/bioone/journals/entities/2236.gif" alt="" class="entityA" align="bottom" />1 bias in resighting rate toward yellow or orange tags. The observed bias is inconsistent with color-associated visibility bias or differential mortality among color-tagged breeding adults. Potential behavioral effects of tag color on individuals and conspecifics should be considered by biologists when planning marking studies.
