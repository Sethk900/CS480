Dynamic Identifiability Analysis-Based Model Structure Evaluation Considering Rating Curve UncertaintyAbstractWhen applying hydrological models, different sources of uncertainty are present, and evaluations of model performances should take these into account to assess model outcomes correctly. Furthermore, uncertainty in the discharge observations complicates the model identification, both in terms of model structure and parameterization. In this paper, the authors compare two different lumped model structures (PDM and NAM) considering uncertainty coming from the rating curve. Limits of acceptability for the model simulations were determined based on derived uncertainty bounds of the discharge observations. The authors applied the DYNamic Identifiability Approach (DYNIA) to identify structural failure of both models and to evaluate the configuration of their structures. In general, similar model performances are observed. However, the model structures tend to behave differently in the course of time, as revealed by the DYNIA approach. Based on the analyses performed, the probability based soil storage representation of the PDM model outperforms the NAM structure. The incorporation of the observation error did not prevent the DYNIA analysis to identify potential model structural deficiencies that are limiting the representation of the seasonal variation, primarily indicated by shifting regions of parameter identifiability. As such, the proposed approach is able to indicate where deficiencies are found and model improvement is needed.
