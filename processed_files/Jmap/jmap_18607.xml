EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE RAINFALL AND SOIL MOISTURE ON SOIL RESPIRATION AND LITTER DECOMPOSITION IN A SUB-TROPICAL HUMID FOREST ECOSYSTEMThe maximum amount of CO2 output (159-700 mg CO2/m2 7 .cntdot. h-1) occurred during May-Sept. when temperature, rainfall and soil moisture were high. Decomposition of leaf litter was rapid in Dendrocalamus hamiltonii, Schima wallichii and other litter, and slow in Artocarpus chaplasha, Castanopsis indica and Shorea robusta.
