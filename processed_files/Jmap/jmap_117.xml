Correlates of survival in Swainson's hawks breeding in northern California.We used a 30-year study of breeding Swainson's hawks (<em>Buteo swainsoni</em>) in northern California to examine correlates of adult apparent survival using multistate models in Program MARK. Specifically, we examined age-related patterns in adult apparent survival and how adult survival was correlated with average annual nest productivity, annual reproductive output, western juniper (<em>Juniperus occidentalis</em>) density around nest sites, distance to agriculture, and amount of agriculture within a territory. Annual estimates of adult survival varied from 0.85 to 0.9 (SE=0.02). There were no indications of senescence or other patterns of age-related changes in adult apparent survival. Adult survival was inversely correlated with average reproductive output, with individuals producing >2 offspring having decreased survival, reflecting a possible trade-off between reproduction and survival. Conversely, reproduction in any year was positively correlated with survival, providing evidence of individual quality influencing adult survival. The distance an individual had to travel to agriculture, where most individuals forage, was negatively related to survival. Primary productivity within the average Swainson's hawk territory was positively correlated with adult survival. Our results indicate that individuals may have higher survival and fitness in areas with high proportions of irrigated agriculture that provides high prey densities, particularly alfalfa.
