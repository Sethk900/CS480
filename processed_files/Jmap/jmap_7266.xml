The status of Bufo poeppigii Tschudi 1845 (Anura: Bufonidae)An analysis of the variation in ventral and dorsal colour pattern, relative width of the parotoids and size of the tympanum of Peruvian Bufo marinus (sensu lato) reveals that strongly patterned specimens (usually attributed to poeppigii) do not differ from weakly patterned ones (usually attributed to marinus) in these characters. An examination of the holotype of B. poeppigii together with ecological observations on both forms show that poeppigii is conspecific with marinus. In the characters analysed, a considerable geographic variation exists over the range of B. marinus. The Peruvian populations are characterized by a high percentage of strongly patterned specimens and by a very small tympanum and are regarded as a valid subspecies, B. m. poeppigii.
