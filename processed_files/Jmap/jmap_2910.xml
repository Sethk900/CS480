Seed germination of Southern Chihuahuan Desert plants in response to elevated temperaturesHigh temperature is one of the main factors that prevent germination, through premature aging of the embryo. The high temperatures reached in the soil of arid environments can affect seed survival and plant establishment. In this study we tested whether seed exposure to high temperature (40 degrees C and 70 degrees C) affected germination of eight species common to the Southern Chihuahuan Desert, and used for fodder, firewood and timber, fiber, edible flowers, fruits and stems. The responses to heat varied between species. Two of the tested species were not affected by heat exposure; for two other species germination was higher, and for the remaining four, germination was lower. There was also a delay of germination after heat exposure. Seeds of three species germinated >1 d slower after exposure to high temperatures. These results could help establish management programs for these Chihuahuan desert species under a climate change scenario. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
