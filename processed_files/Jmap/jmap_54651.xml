Exchange equilibria of potassium in soils, V. Effect of natural organic matter on K-Ca exchangeExchange equilibria of K-Ca were studied in five soil samples (Anglberg surface, ABS; Anglberg subsurface, ABSS; Ottenhofen surface, OHS; Ottenhofen surface limid, OHSL; Buchhofen surface, BHS) from the Federal Republic of Germany. These samples had a wide difference in their clay content, clay mineralogy, CEC, K-fixation capacity, organic matter (OM), specific surface area, and surface charge density (SCD). Untreated and H2O2-treated samples were Ca-saturated and equilibrated with KCl+CaCl2 solutions at a constant chloride concentration of 0.025 M 1âˆ’1 in the equilibrium solutions. The experimental results were described, using the Gaines and Thomas, and Babcock and Duckart thermodynamic approaches, and various selectivity quotients. Out of five, two soil samples showed a decrease in the Gapon (KG) and Vanselow (KV) selectivity quotients in the lower K-saturation (i.e., 0â€“15 exchangeable potassium percentage, EPP, in ABS; 0â€“30 EPP in ABBS) zone on oxidation of OM. In the remaining three soil samples, KG and KV increased with H2O2-treatment for the whole exchange isotherms. The Gaines and Thomas standard free energy for K-Ca exchange (Î”Go) decreased in all but one (i.e., ABSS) and Babcock and Duckart (Î”Goâ€²) in all the soil samples on OM oxidation. The values of Î”Go were less negative than those of Î”Goâ€² for comparable soil samples. The positive or negative effect of OM on K-preference has been ascribed to the â€œresultantâ€ of the two opposing phenomena, viz., an increase in SCD and â€œlow K-specific adsorption sitesâ€ (causing a decrease in K-preference), and an increase in the internal: external surfaces due to organo-mineral colloids (causing an increase in K-preference).
