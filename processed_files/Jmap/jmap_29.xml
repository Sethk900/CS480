Do litter decomposition and nitrogen mineralization show the same trend in the response to dry and wet years in the Patagonian steppe?In arid environments, dry and wet years have similar number of small rainfall events but wet years result from the occurrence of a few large rainfall events. What are the implications of these different precipitation patterns on ecosystem functioning? Here, we examined the differential response of soil processes to wet and dry years. Specifically, we assessed litter decomposition and soil N mineralization responses to precipitation excess in the Patagonian steppe, and compared with responses to drought conditions previously reported for this ecosystem.
