Simulating Agricultural Drainage Water Reuse Using QUAL2K Model: Case Study of the Ismailia Canal Catchment Area, EgyptAbstractThis paper proposes and evaluates a number of drainage water mixing projects in canals applying QUAL2K, which is a river and stream water quality model recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). Mitigation measures and precautions were suggested fur use as guidelines for environmentally safe application. The results showed that QUAL2K proved to be an effective tool in the comparative evaluation of potential water quality improvement programs, particularly on the salinity and water quality parameters that address agriculture practices. Simulation results showed that most selected water quality parameters for most of the considered projects complied with the standards of Egyptian law. Moreover, electrical conductivity (EC) predictions were found within the permissible limit with the recommended fit crops. The reduction in drain discharge reduces pollutant loads entering Temsah Lake and might help save the flora and fauna to support recreation activities.
