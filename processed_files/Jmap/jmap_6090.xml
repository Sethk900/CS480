The effect of environment and cultivar on sunflower seed. II. Composition and processing qualityThe processing quality of sunflower seed is determined by its oil yield, oil cake yield and oil cake composition. Quality of the oil cake is determined by its protein and crude fibre content. Seed composition is affected by both cultivar and environment. This study examines the contribution of cultivar and environment to the variation of seed oil, protein and crude fibre content, and its relation to the potential oil yield and potential quality and yield of the oil cake. Seed of five cultivars produced at six environments was analysed. Oil, protein and crude fibre content, as well as the potential oil yield, were affected more by environmental than by genetic effects. Environment was also the main contributor to variation in protein content of the potential oil cake. Crude fibre content of the potential oil cake was affected slightly more by environment than cultivar. Protein content of the potential oil cake declined with increased seed oil content. The crude fibre content of the potential oil cake of cultivar PAN 7392 was high despite high hullability, indicating the need for fibre analyses to support hullability analyses.
