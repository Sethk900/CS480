Baeocera galapagoensis nov. spec, a new scaphidiid beetle from the Galapagos islands (coleoptera, scaphidiidae)Although entomological expeditions to the Galapagos made large collections of Cole√≥ptera available for study, no scaphidiids were yet recorded from this archipelago. Therefore, I was surprised to receive from Prof. H. Franz, Vienna, specimens collected on four of the islands by modern techniques and from habitats apparently previously neglected. They proved to be conspecific, belonging to a very interesting new species of the genus Baeocera Erichson. My thanks are due to Prof. H. Franz for the loan of this material.
