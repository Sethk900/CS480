Contemporary pedogenetic processes in a ferrallitic soil in Uganda, I. IdentificationFerrallitic soils were originally considered to be pedogenetically â€œdeadâ€, with few pedological processes taking place except perhaps leaching. A study of the Buganda clay loam series, a widespread soil in southern Uganda, showed that although this ferrallitic soil is very highly weathered chemically, two important groups of pedogenetic processes are currently active, differentiating the B from the C horizon. These are alteration of soil structure/physical properties and clay translocation. Leaching and clay mineral transformation are not occurring. It is suggested that the pedogenetic basis for classifying soils as ferrallitic has become outdated and that the criteria used need revision.
