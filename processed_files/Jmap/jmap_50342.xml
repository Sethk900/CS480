A chromosomal investigation of some European Leiodidae (Coleoptera), with particular focus on Spanish subterranean LeptodiriniKaryotypes are shown for Leiodes calcarata (Erichson, 1845), Catops coracinus Kellner, 1846, Cantabrogeus luquei (Salgado, 1993), Espanoliella luquei Salgado & Fresneda, 2005, Fresnedaella lucius Salgado, Labrada & Luque, 2011, Notidocharis uhagoni (Sharp 1872), Quaestus (Quaesticulus) pasensis Salgado, Labrada & Luque, 2010, all of which are shown to have a diploid number of 20 autosomes plus Xy (â™‚) or XX (â™€) sex chromosomes, as well as an as yet undescribed triploid species of the genus Cantabrogeus Salgado, 2000. These results are contrasted with published information, all on Leptodirini, which lists 10 species as having diploid numbers of 22 + Xy or XX. It is shown that the higher chromosome number (n = 11 + X or y) previously reported refers exclusively to the more derived Leptodirini (â€œinfraflagellatesâ€) whereas the lower number (n = 10 + X or y) refers to the less derived surface-dwelling forms and the less derived Leptodirini (â€œsupraflagellatesâ€).
