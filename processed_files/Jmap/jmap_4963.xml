Neotropical Fanniidae (Insecta: Diptera): new species of Euryomma Stein from ColombiaEuryomma Stein (Diptera: Fanniidae), a mainly Neotropical genus, had not been reported from Colombia. In this contribution we describe seven new species of the genus (Euryomma aburrae sp. nov., Euryomma chitarera sp. nov., Euryomma cornuatum sp. nov., Euryomma guane sp. nov., Euryomma muisca sp. nov., Euryomma tahami sp. nov. and Euryomma uwa sp. nov.). The new species occur in the departments of Antioquia (Sistema Andino, Cordillera Central), Santander, Norte de Santander, Cundinamarca and Boyac√° (Sistema Andino, Cordillera Oriental), between 750 m and 2810 m, and are associated with decomposing organic matter. The forensic potential of E. muisca sp. nov., E. chitarera sp. nov. and E. cornuatum sp. nov. is highlighted. Identification keys to the genera of Fanniidae and to the males of the new species are provided. Descriptions of the male and female and illustrations of the terminalia are also provided.
