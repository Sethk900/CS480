The milliped genus Mestosoma in Costa Rica (Polydesmida: Paradoxosomatidae)Summary Fresh material of a species of Mestosoma taken in Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica, shows the animal to be undescribed and not identical with M. pulvillatum as reported by Attems in 1933. The species is described as Mestosoma moorei, and compared with the presumably related taxa M. salvadorii and M. semirugosum, both the latter figured from typical material. A list of the species of the Salvadorii Group is given and arranged on the basis of color patterns. It is suggested that perhaps M. semirugosum be relocated from this group, on the basis of a difference in the gonopod telopodite.
