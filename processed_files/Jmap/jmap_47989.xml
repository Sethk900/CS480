Littoral caprellids (Crustacea: Amphipoda) from the Mexican Central Pacific coast, with the description of four new speciesThe caprellids of shallow-water localities from the Mexican Central Pacific coast are investigated. The Mexican Pacific coast is poorly known, unlike more northern sites such as the California coast where c. 40 species have been reported. Hence, this is the first study dealing with the caprellidean fauna of this area. Seven species in three genera were found (four of which are new to science): Aciconula acanthosoma Chess, 1989; Caprella equilibra Say, 1818; Caprella mendax Mayer, 1903; Caprella pitu sp. nov.; Liropus isabelensis sp. nov.; Paracaprella carballoi sp. nov.; and Paracaprella isabelae sp. nov. All the species are fully illustrated.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:B04D3837-E7E1-4DA5-A8ED-28CA7BF1E1AF
