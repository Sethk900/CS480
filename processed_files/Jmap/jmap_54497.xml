Morphology, fertility and classification of productive soils on serpentinized peridotite in California (U.S.A.)Most soils in humid climates decrease in fertility as weathering releases plant nutrients from their parent materials and the nutrients are leached away. Young soils on peridotite, however, have low productivity which increases as weathering and leaching remove Mg, Ni, and Co. This is illustrated by comparing a Xerochrept and a more weathered and leached Haplohumult from the Klamath Mountains. All exchangeable Ca/Mg ratios are < 0.4 in the Ochrept and > 1.0 in the Humult. The ratio of total Ni and Co to total Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn are all lower in the Humult. The Dunning timber site index (height of conifers at 300 years) increases 24% from shallow to deep Ochrepts, attributed to increases in available water capacity (AWC). It increases another 27% from deep Ochrepts to deep Humults with relatively small increases in AWC. Therefore, increased productivity from the Ochrepts to the Humults appears to be due more to increased fertility than to increased AWC. The timber site index increases another 10% from the Humult to a Humox (tentative classification) in the Sierra Nevada, but it is uncertain whether this increase is due to increase in AWC or in fertility. None of these soils on peridotite are completely accommodated in the Soil Taxonomy. The Ochrepts fit well to the subgroup, the Humult to the suborder, and the Humox fits only to the order level.
