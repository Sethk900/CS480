A regional look at HANPP: human consumption is increasing, NPP is notAbstract Abdi et al (2014 Environ. Res. Lett. 9 094003), have adapted the concept of comparing supply and demand of annual plant production known as human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) to a region of the Sahel with rapid population growth. They found that HANPP more than doubled over the study period of 20002010, from 19 to 41, suggesting increasing vulnerability of these populations to food insecurity.
