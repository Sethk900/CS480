Systematics, phylogeny, and natural history of Bullacta exarata (Philippi, 1849): an endemic cephalaspidean gastropod from the China SeaIn this paper new data on the systematics, phylogeny, and trophic ecology of Bullacta exarata (Philippi, 1849) are presented. B. exarata is a cephalaspidean gastropod endemic to the China Sea that lives in estuaries along the north-eastern Chinese and western South Korean coastlines. The systematic position of this species is controversial and has been a matter of continuous debate. Therefore, in order to produce new insights into the phylogenetic position of this species, morphological and anatomical features have been analysed through fine dissection work and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), together with DNA sequence data. Bayesian phylogenetic inference based on concatenated sequences of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and nuclear genes 18SrRNA and 28SrRNA, suggests the inclusion of B. exarata in the family Haminoeidae. SEM analysis of gut contents revealed that B. exarata feeds upon diatoms.
