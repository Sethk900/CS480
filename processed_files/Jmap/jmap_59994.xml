Improved Analytic Model of the Optimum Dimensions Designated for Transit Bus Service ZonesAbstractThis paper examines the problem of determining the relation of variables and deterministic parameters of the optimum solution space for bus service zones within an urban transit model, due to the ever-evolving need for an efficient and effective transit system in modern society. A positive solution for the length of a local bus service zone was proposed and proven. Moreover, the Newton method was applied to derive a convergent sequence faster than the alternate sequence proposed in a previous paper. This analytic model will help transportation operators determine the optimum dimensions of bus service zones with great accuracy and will influence other tasks such as budget allocation.
