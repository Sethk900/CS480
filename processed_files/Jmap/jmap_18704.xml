Plant and microbial contribution to soil respiration under zero and disk tillageTillage systems may produce changes of the soil organic matter level by altering carbon inputs and outputs from agroecosystems. The effects of two tillage systems, zero and disk tillage, were evaluated on the C-CO2 emission to the atmosphere of an agricultural soil from the Rolling Pampa of Argentina and on plant and microbial contributions to soil respiration in a wheat fallow sequence. No differences in soil temperature or water content were encountered between tillage treatments throughout a year. Differences in the intensity of soil physical disruption or in plant residues incorporation caused by tillage system had no influence on the annual production of C-CO2. An average of 10 t C ha(-1) y(-1) was evolved from the soil independently of tillage management. Heterotrophic respiration accounted for 74-82% of the C-CO2 fluxes. Neither microbial nor wheat roots C-CO2 production was affected by the tillage systems.
