Environmental zonation across the Australian arid region based on long-term vegetation dynamicsZonation of landscapes is generally based on broad scale biophysical data, field surveys, imagery and expert knowledge. Such zonation represents a static view of the environment and does not reflect dynamics and function. Arid environments are however often highly dynamic, and spatial and temporal patterns may be expressed over long periods of time. These dynamics need to be understood for management. Our aim is to understand the dynamics and functional response of vegetation in the Australian arid zone, and use this to inform and potentially improve the currently employed stratification. Principal component analysis of 25 years of satellite imagery identified underlying factors influencing patterns of arid vegetation growth, and regions of similar long-term response. Dominant factors of variation were identified as the spatial distribution of total vegetation growth, seasonality of growth, magnitude of seasonal variability in growth, and regularity of variation in growth. Additional variation resulted from episodic vegetation growth of limited spatial extent and duration. Classes expressing these functional components were compared with the existing biogeographical regions, revealing agreement in some instances, and in other cases adding information previously not available. The study demonstrates a new approach to Australian landscape zonation that has potential for much wider application.
