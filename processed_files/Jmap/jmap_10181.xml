Effects of Mowing on Anthraquinone for Deterrence of Canada GeeseAnthraquinone (AQ)-based repellents have been shown to reduce Canada goose (Branta canadensis) use of turfgrass; however, impacts of frequent mowing on efficacy of AQ have not been studied. Our objective was to determine efficacy and longevity of a rain- fast AQ-based avian repellent, FlightControlH PLUS (FCP), as a deterrent of free-ranging resident Canada geese under 2 mowing frequencies. We conducted the study at 8 sites in the Triangle region (Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill) of North Carolina, USA. We arranged our experiment in a randomized complete block design, with each of 8 sites containing 4 0.1-ha treatment combinations: 1) treated with FCP and mowed every 4 days (T4), 2) treated with FCP and mowed every 8 days (T8), 3) untreated and mowed every 4 days, and 4) untreated and mowed every 8 days. We conducted 4 37-day field sessions (JunJul 2007, SepOct 2007, JunJul 2008, and SepOct 2008), representing the summer molting phase and the full-plumage phase. Resident goose use (measured by daily no. of droppings) was 4170% lower on treated plots than on untreated plots, but use was similar between T4 and T8. Average FCP coverage on grass blades decreased in coverage from approximately 95% to 10% over the 30-day posttreatment phase. Results indicate that resident Canada goose use of FCP-treated turfgrass areas was lower than untreated areas even when chemical coverage on grass was 10%. Further, mowing frequency did not have a clear impact on the efficacy of FCP as a Canada goose repellent.
