Shrub characterization using terrestrial laser scanning and implications for airborne LiDAR assessmentSagebrush-steppe ecosystems across the United States Intermountain West are experiencing major structural and functional changes. Scientists and managers need effective technologies to understand such dynamic changes across broad spatial scales. We tested the capacity of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) to automatically determine structural information of individual shrubs (principally Artemisia tridentata) and shrub canopies in eastern Washington, USA. Because current airborne LiDAR systems have technological constraints that may limit their utility in shrub-dominated ecosystems, we used the TLS data both in their basic form and to simulate high resolution discrete-return airborne LiDAR data with sample densities of 4 and 16 points m−2. Through spatial wavelet analysis we automatically detected the locations of up to 78% of all individual shrubs identified in the field and up to 88% of shrubs with a crown diameter > 1.5 m. Shrub height and canopy cover derived from TLS data were significantly correlated with field measurements (respectively, r2 = 0.94 and 0.51, p < 0.001, α = 0.05). Automated detection of individual shrub crown area using the high resolution simulated airborne LiDAR dataset was also significantly correlated with field measurements (r2 = 0.47, p ≤ 0.01). Our results indicate that TLS data are useful for automatic quantification of shrub structure and provide a glimpse to the utility of the next generation of small-footprint airborne LiDAR instruments in quantifying shrub biophysical parameters across broad areas.
