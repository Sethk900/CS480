Chainfruit cholla (Opuntia fulgida Engelm.) misidentified as rosea cactus (Opuntia rosea DC.) in South AfricaRosea cactus (Opuntia rosea DC.) is a name that has long been used for a densely spiny cactus invading dry savanna in South Africa. Recent efforts to improve biological control of this invasive species using cochineal (Dactylopius tomentosus (Lamarck)) led to the discovery that the plant species had been misidentified. A biotype of cochineal collected from rosea cactus in Mexico failed to develop on ‘rosea cactus’ in South Africa. This pointed to the incorrect identification of rosea cactus in South Africa and led to an investigation of other similar cacti in Mexico. O. fulgida (chainfruit cholla) is similar in appearance to rosea cactus but has characteristic chains of fruits that persist for years. In South Africa these chains of fruits had not been observed because chemical and mechanical control since the 1960's had prevented the plants from developing to maturity.-In an isolated infestation bordering on Zimbabwe the characteristic chains of fruit were seen for the first time. A comparison of the morphological characteristics of both species led to the conclusion that in South Africa, O. rosea had been misidentified and is in fact O. fulgida.
