Pre-emergence weed control with metolachlor/flumetsulam mixturesMetolachlor (2—chloro—6′—ethyl—N-(2—methoxy—1—methylethyl)acet—o—toluidide) / flumetsulam (2′6′—difluoro—5-methyl[1,2,4] triazolo [1,5—a] pyrimidine—2—sulfonanilide) mixtures were evaluated in 77 field experiments in maize (Zea mays L.), groundnuts (Arachis hypogaea L.), soya beans (Glycine max (L.) Merr and dry beans (Phaseolus spp). Many broadleaf weeds, including Tribulus terrestris, were selectively controlled with a 50:1 mixture. Application rates varied, depending on soil type, from 744 g ai. ha1 metolachlor + 15 g a.i. ha−1 flumetsulam on sandy soils to 1673 g a.i. ha-1 metolachlor + 34 g a i. ha1 flumetsulam on soils with more than 40% clay. Full rotational flexibility exists for field crops on the Highveld after the application of metolachlor/flumetsulam mixtures.
