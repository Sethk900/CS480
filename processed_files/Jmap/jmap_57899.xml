Automated Soil Lysimeter for Determination of Actual Evapotranspiration of a Bog in Quebec, CanadaAbstractA limited number of publications in the literature address the measurement of actual evapotranspiration (AET) from peat soils. AET is an important parameter in the description of water pathways of an ecosystem. In peatlands, where the water table is near the surface, the measurement of AET represents a challenge. This paper discusses the development of an automated lysimeter installed between July 12 and 27, 2010, at an 11-ha bog site, Pont-Rouge (42Â km west of Quebec City, Canada). This system was made of an isolated block of peat, maintained at the same water level as the surrounding water table by a system of submersible pressure transmitters and pumps. The change in water level in millimeters in the isolated block of peat was used to calculate the water lost through evapotranspiration while for accounting the precipitation. The rates of AET were calculated for each day of the study period. This relatively inexpensive and simple to install system may eventually be used to calculate AET on peaty soils in the years to come.
