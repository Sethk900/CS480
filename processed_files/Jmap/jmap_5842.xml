Juvenile Dogs as Potential Sentinels for West Nile Virus SurveillanceWe conducted a study to determine whether juvenile stray dogs could be sentinels for West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance. Seroconversion was detected 6 weeks before the first reported human case. Our findings provide evidence that dogs could be useful sentinels for monitoring areas for evidence of WNV during transmission seasons.
