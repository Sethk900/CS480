Are extra-pair young better than within-pair young? A comparison of survival and dominance in alpine marmot.<ol><li>In socially monogamous species, females may seek extra-pair copulation to gain genetic benefits. In order to test this 'genetic quality' hypothesis, one must compare the performance of extra-pair young (EPY) and within-pair young (WPY). Such tests, however, are scarce and results published so far are inconclusive.</li><li>Here, we test the 'genetic quality' hypothesis using multistate capture-recapture models to compare age-specific survival and access to dominance between EPY and WPY in the alpine marmot <em>Marmota marmota</em>, a socially monogamous mammal showing extra-pair paternities.</li><li>When compared with WPY, survival of EPY was higher by 15%, 10% and 30%, for juveniles, yearlings and 2-year-old individuals, respectively. Survival at older ages did not differ.</li><li>Survival corresponded to true survival for yearlings and juveniles as dispersal does not occur before 2 years of age in marmots. For older individuals, survival estimates included a mixture of survival and dispersal. The 30% increase of the 2-year-old EPY survival might reflect delayed dispersal rather than high survival of EPY as compared with WPY.</li><li>WPY and EPY had the same probability (0·28) to access dominance at 2 years of age, but EPY were more successful at older ages than WPY (0·46 vs. 0·10).</li><li>Both survival and reproductive performance were higher in EPY than in WPY. The fitness advantages of adopting such a mixed mating tactic are thus likely to be high for marmot females. We suggest that obtaining genetic benefits is the main evolutionary force driving extra-pair paternity in alpine marmots.</li></ol>
