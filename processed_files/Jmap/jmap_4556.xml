Etiolation aids rooting of Protea cynaroides cuttingsThe role that starch content and blanching play in the rooting of Protea cynaroides cuttings was studied. P. cynaroides stems were blanched on the motherplant in the field, which resulted in a higher starch concentration in the cuttings. The relationship between starch content and rooting was also established, whereby the ability of the blanched cuttings to maintain a consistent starch level throughout the rooting period, resulted in the acceleration of the rooting process. The blanched cuttings had a higher dry root mass than the control at day 90 when the cuttings were ready to be transplanted. The untreated cuttings were only suitable for transplanting after 120 days. Blanching the cuttings also resulted in a higher rooting percentage (100%) than the control (60%).
