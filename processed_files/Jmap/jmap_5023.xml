An unusual ecology among whiptails: the case of Cnemidophorus lacertoides from a restinga habitat in southern BrazilWe studied the ecology of Cnemidophorus lacertoides at a restinga habitat in southern Brazil. Peak activity occurred between 12.00 and 15.00. The mean body temperature of active lizards (35.0 ± 2.9°C) was relatively low compared with other whiptails and was significantly influenced by environmental temperatures. Mean snout–vent length and mean body mass of individuals were 56.5 mm and 4.4 g, respectively. Male and female C. lacertoides were not significantly different in body size. Cnemidophorus lacertoides consumed 12 types of prey, with ants and spiders being the most important items. Unexpectedly, lizards did not consume termites, which tend to be very important items in the diets of most whiptails. We conclude that the population of Cnemidophorus lacertoides we studied deviates from the typical whiptail ecology because many of its ecological features differ from those of most other cnemidophorines of similar size.
