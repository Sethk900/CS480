A Field Test of the Northern Goshawk Bioregional Monitoring Design: Is it Cost Effective?Monitoring of northern goshawks typically occurs at nest sites, which is an effective approach for obtaining information on nesting activity and reproductive success, but less effective at providing information on goshawk distribution or abundance. In 2002 the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service began the process of designing a method for monitoring occupancy rates of goshawks over large spatial scales. In 2003 we conducted a field test of the Forest Service's bioregional monitoring design in southwestern Colorado. Our goal was to determine how much it would cost to implement. Average costs for surveying each primary sample unit were $1,060.34 and average per station survey-visit costs were $6.99. It is important to recognize that our primary sample unit survey cost estimate is higher than might be expected on average because our surveys were conducted during a poor nesting year for goshawks. This information will be instrumental to wildlife managers, whether conducting bioregional monitoring or local project level surveys for goshawks (WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN 34(1):215â€“217; 2006)
