Phylogenetic relationships among genera in the Calanidae (Crustacea: Copepoda) based on morphologyCladistic analysis of Calanidae recovered two major clades: a tropical epipelagic clade composed of species without ontogenetic vertical migration (Canthocalanus + Cosmocalanus + Nannocalanus + Undinula); and a clade of ontogenetically migrating genera (Neocalanus + Calanoides + Calanus + Mesocalanus). The latter clade is least well supported although its Calanoides and Neocalanus lineages are well supported. Morphology-based topologies are largely congruent with published molecular trees, differing chiefly in the positions of Mesocalanus and Calanus. Independent homoplasious trends in character states in the male leg 5 include: reduction in segmentation and number of setae, increasing asymmetry as well as the probable retention of larval characteristics. The monophyly of Calanoides, Neocalanus and Calanus is well supported. It is postulated that Calanidae radiated during the mid to late Triassic from a bathypelagic megacalanid which was adapted to low oxygen conditions. High latitude locations may have been the first epipelagic environments to be recolonized.
