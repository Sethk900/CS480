Litter effects on plant regeneration in arid lands: a complex balance between seed retention, seed longevity and soil-seed contact.<ol><li>The recovery of rare, threatened plant populations can sometimes be achieved through modification of the disturbance regime. Accumulation of litter is likely to follow a reduction in grazing pressure and we therefore examine its effects on seedling recruitment of a threatened species in a temperate arid rangeland.</li><li>We studied the effects of litter on seed longevity in the field and performed glasshouse and field experiments with natural and plastic litter to assess their physical and biological/chemical nature. Seeds were sown on the soil surface, buried or within the litter layer. Published data on spatial distribution of seeds were used to calculate the net effect of litter on seedling recruitment.</li><li>Litter increased seed longevity. In the glasshouse, litter increased seedling emergence and growth for surface, but not for buried, seeds. Seeds within the litter layer (no seed-soil contact) showed reduced seedling emergence and growth. In the field, litter did not have a direct effect but emergence was promoted by burial.</li><li>Integrating the effects of microsite quality and seed density showed that litter microsites recruited <em>c</em>. 50% of <em>Bromus pictus</em> seedlings, double that expected from its cover (25%). The positive effect of litter on seed density and on seed longevity outweighed the negative effect of litter acting as a mechanical barrier to burial.</li><li>Inconsistent effects of litter on plant recruitment in arid environments may be due to responses being dependent on seed size and shape, and thus may represent indirect effects acting via the probability of burial. Alternatively, studies may report effects only on seed retention or emergence and growth rather than net effects on establishment.</li></ol>
