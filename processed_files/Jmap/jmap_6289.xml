The effect of chloride on four different citrus rootstocksSeedlings of Troyer citrange [Poncirus Mollata L. Raf. × Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck] (Tro), Citrus volkameriana (Vol), Carrizo citrange [Poncirus trifoliata L. Raf. × Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck], (Car) and Rough lemon [Citrus jambhiri Lush.] (Rie) were tested for tolerance to chloride in irrigation water, ranging from 0 to 1147 mg L−1 chloride, as NaCI. Based on the occurrence of toxicity symptoms on the leaves, Vol was the most tolerant to CI, followed by Rle. Decrease in dry mass of shoots and roots with increased chloride levels again showed Vol to be the most tolerant rootstock followed by Rle. Tro and Car were the most sensitive to chloride. The shoot: root ratio increased with increasing chloride levels indicating that more shoots were produced in relation to roots at increasing chloride levels. The percentage chloride in the leaves showed a constant increase with increasing CI levels to the point where leaf drop occurred.
