Mineral nitrogen cycling through earthworm casts in a grazed pasture under elevated atmospheric CO2.We used the New Zealand grazed pasture free air CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment experiment to determine the effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on earthworm (<em>Aporrectodea caliginosa</em> and <em>Lumbricus rubellus</em>) cast production and mineral nitrogen (N) concentration over a 5-week period in the spring. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> did not affect earthworm biomass or the amount of cast material produced. However, cast mineral N concentrations were 18% lower, resulting in 27% less mineral N being deposited on the soil surface under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. An analysis of the earthworms' potential diet showed that a reduction in the N content of sheep dung at elevated CO<sub>2</sub> was the most likely cause of the lower cast N concentrations. Earthworm casts made only a small contribution to mineral N cycling in our system; however, their quality may act as a sensitive indicator of reduced N availability under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> which is consistent with the hypothesised process of progressive N limitation.
