Removing Adult Overstory Trees Stimulates Growth and Transpiration of Conspecific Juvenile Trees.During the last century, the density of Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei Buchholz) has greatly increased in oak savannahs of central Texas. Recently, juniper removal has been advocated as a regional water conservation tool. In this study, we investigated whether juvenile trees released from an overstory canopy after clearing exhibited accelerated growth and water consumption. We compared leaf-level transpiration (El) and carbon assimilation (Anet) rates among juvenile juniper under three different treatment scenarios: 1) in the open, 2) under an adult juniper canopy or 3) recently released by the removal of an adult juniper canopy. Released plants apparently grew faster and used more water than other juvenile trees; average Anet of released plants was 94%-162% greater (P < 0.05) than those beneath an adult canopy and 22%-44% greater than open-grown plants. Furthermore, average El of released plants was 22%-72% greater than those beneath an adult canopy and 13%-22% greater than open-grown plants. The...
