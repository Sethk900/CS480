The eolian origin of silty mantle in sedentary soils from Korea and JapanThe concentration, particle-size distribution and oxygen isotope composition (δ18OSMOW) of quartz were examined in order to determine the extent to which the accretion of long-distance eolian dusts from the interior of China had formed the sedentary soils overlying diverse parent materials in Korea and Japan. The quartz content of the surface soils developed on quartz-free basaltic materials varies from 8.9 to 47.7%. Generally, the soil quartz found in surface horizons is finer than of the subsurface horizons and/or substrata. The particle-size of the soil quartz decreases from the west coast to eastern coastal margins of Korea and to the Japanese islands. This follows the major trajectory of westerly winds which carry the eolian dusts from the interior of China to mid-latitude regions of the North Pacific. The oxygen isotope composition of the fine quartz (1–10 μm in diameter) when separated from surface and subsurface horizons, is found in a relatively narrow range of + 15.9 to + 17.7‰ The values are indiscernible from those of recent eolian dusts from the interior desert and loess plateau of China. The δ18O values from the same sized quartz found in C horizons, + 10.4 and + 19.2%, consisting of saprolitic andesites and shales, respectively, differ from those of the overlying soils. The δ18O values of soil quartz developed on igneous materials systematically decrease with increasing particle-size to 53 μm (∼ 14%). They abruptly decrease to + 8 to + 12% for fractions larger than 53 μm. A large apparent oxygen isotope fractionation (up to 10%) - between fine (+ 17%) and coarse (+ 8 to + 12%) grained quartz observed in the samples - does not represent an equilibrium oxygen isotope fractionation for normal magmatic processes. The data provide evidence for an eolian origin of the fine quartz incorporated during soil development.
