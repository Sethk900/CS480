Factors Influencing Seedling Establishment Rates in Zostera marina and Their Implications for Seagrass Restoration.Selection of strategies to efficiently utilize limited seed supplies in efforts to restore the seagrass <em>Zostera marina</em> (eelgrass) requires a better understanding of the processes that limit seedling establishment at potential restoration sites. We investigated the effect of seed distribution timing on seedling establishment and tested for interactive effects of seed burial and distribution timing. We also investigated the effect of habitat type on seedling establishment by distributing <em>Z. marina</em> seeds inside and outside of established <em>Ruppia maritima</em> (widgeongrass) patches and examined mechanisms causing habitat differences by manipulating seed position (buried or unburied) and vulnerability to seed predators (unprotected or protected in packets). Seeds distributed on the sediment surface in the summer (July or August) produced fewer seedlings than seeds distributed in fall (October) in five of six trials over 3 years. Seed burial increased success rates for seeds distributed in summer at one of two sites tested, eliminating the effect of season, but reduced success at the other site. Seeds placed in <em>R. maritima</em> generally produced fewer seedlings than seeds in bare sand, and although seed burial and protection in packets increased success in bare sand at three of four sites, the effect was less consistent in <em>R. maritima</em>. We conclude that seed predation and physical interactions were influential in reducing seedling establishment in <em>R. maritima</em>, contrary to hypotheses positing a nursery role for existing vegetation. Efficient restoration efforts with <em>Z. marina</em> seeds should target unvegetated areas after summertime sources of mortality have diminished. Direct seed burial may enhance seedling establishment rates.
