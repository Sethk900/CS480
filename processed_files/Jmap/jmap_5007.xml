Larval morphology of the genus Hydrocassis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Hydrophilidae)The larval morphology of the genus Hydrocassis Fairmaire, 1878 is described on the basis of three species of the genus: second instar of Hydrocassis jengi Satô, 1998, all instars of Hydrocassis lacustris (Sharp, 1884) and second and third instars of Hydrocassis uncinata Ji et Schödl, 1998; the former two belong to the Hydrocassis scapulata species group and the latter to the Hydrocassis scaphoides species group. Primary chaetotaxy of the larval head of Hydrocassis is described based on the first instar larvae of H. lacustris. Larval morphology of all genera of Sperchopsini with known larvae is summarized based on descriptions and figures from the literature, which are compared with Hydrocassis: larval morphology of Hydrocassis is similar to that of Sperchopsis, and the presumably closely related genus Ametor is distinguishable from Hydrocassis by characters of larval morphology. A key to the Sperchopsini genera on the basis of larval characters is provided.
