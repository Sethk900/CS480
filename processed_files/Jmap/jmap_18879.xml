Co-2 respiration from soil under a spruce stand and in a reforested clear-felled areaSoil respiration was measured in a spruce stand (Picea abies [L.] K a r s t.) of the 1(st) generation at an age of a large-diameter stand in a clear-felled area and in a successive spruce stand of the 2(nd) generation. In the first and second years after the clear-felling, respiration was equally intensive in the clear-felled area and under the spruce stand. In the third year and in next years, respiration in the clear-felled area significantly increased by 11 to 62%. Even after the new stand reached the stage of a young growth at an age of 16-20 years, respiration on the former clear-felled area was substantially higher than under the mature spruce stand, viz. by 38 to 53% under an unthinned thicket and by 14.1 to 26.5% under a thinned thicket. The fact corroborates higher biochemical activity in the soil of a clear-felled area even after 20 years from the stand establishment. Monthly and annual production of CO2 from soil was also calculated for carbon balancing in the ecosystem. Highly significant statistical dependence of respiration on soil and air temperature was found, however, the dependence of respiration on total precipitation and soil moisture was not found.
