Effect of a Passive Mixing Device on the Electrical Conductivity and pH Values of a Nutrient SolutionAbstractThe adjustment of a nutrient solution using an automated fertigation system for optimal irrigation conditions increases productivity and decreases the environmental impact of horticulture. A new generation of infrastructure for automated solution preparation is becoming more common in high-technological protected horticultural areas; for example, the direct injection of all components into the nutrient solution using a Venturi device on the irrigation headpiece is being widely used. The present study evaluates the utility of a passive mixing device that was incorporated into the circuit of the fertigation headpiece and its impact on parameters such as the electric conductivity (EC) and pH of the nutrient solution. The results suggest two important effects, as follows: (1) the device helps in the adjustment of the EC and pH in the nutrient solution, compared with values set during programming, and (2) there is a lower variation in the dispersion between the maximum and minimum values.
