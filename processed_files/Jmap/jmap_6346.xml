The inheritance of seedling growth rate in grain sorghumThe inheritance of growth rate in grain sorghum seedlings was studied in two factorial crossing systems. The presence of both additive and dominance genetic variation was indicated. The additive gene effects played a greater role. At least three genetic factors contributed to the variation in the F1 generation. Seed mass and probably seed-borne fungi also influenced growth rate. Heritability estimates of 0.74 - 0.95 confirmed the potential for rapid genetic improvement of the growth rate of grain sorghum seedlings.
