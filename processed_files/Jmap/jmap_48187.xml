Multitemporal analysis of satellite data and their use in the monitoring of the environmental impacts of open cast lignite mining areas in Eastern GermanyThis paper reports an investigation into the use and application of remote sensing data for monitoring the environmental impacts of open cast lignite mining in Eastern Germany. The use of remote sensing for environmental monitoring and the reclamation of such devastated areas has been demonstrated on three open cast lignite mining areas, only one of which is still active. This investigation is based on the digital analysis of several Landsat-TM and ERS-1 data sets acquired from 1989 to 1994. The characteristics of the imagery enable quantitative analysis of di erent open cast mine features, such as waste, water bodies, change of land use, reclamation processes and estimation of vegetation cover in the a ected areas. On the basis of the Maximum Likelihood Classi® cation of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data the open cast mining areas were separated into bare open cast areas and areas of less and dense vegetation. The bare open cast areas were classi® ed with respect to type of di erent sediments and the vegetation was separated into di erent classes according to the age of the vegetation and the density cover. Apart from these, water bodies within the mining areas were classi® ed into di erent spectral classes depending on their hydrochemical properties. The classi® cation algorithm was applied to all the Landsat TM data in order to detect temporal and spatial changes in the mining areas. A 1993 ERS-1 image was used in an e ort to determine the geomorphological features of the open cast lignite mining areas. An enhanced ERS-1 image provided a helpful tool for the visual interpretation, but integration of the ERS-1 image did not improve the ® nal classi® cation results.
