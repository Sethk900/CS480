Data Collection and Organization by Smartphone for Infrastructure AssessmentAbstractThe collection and organization of data for infrastructure assessment have traditionally been laborious and lengthy tasks. Smartphones now provide the needed hardware and software to ease the burden of these chores. The authors have developed the Mobile Information Collection Application, which organizes these capabilities for infrastructure assessment. The use of this application in the 2011 Mississippi River flood of record and in the reconnaissance of routes for movement indicates that it can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of information collection and organization.
