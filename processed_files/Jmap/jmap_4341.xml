Comparison of medium-term organic and inorganic fertiliser application on leaf nutrient concentration and yield of maize in rural agriculture in the Mbizana area, Eastern Cape province, South AfricaA five-year study was conducted in the Mbizana area, Eastern Cape province, to assess the seasonal and medium term effects of chicken manure and inorganic fertiliser application to an acid clay loam topsoil on nutrient element uptake and yield of maize in a field trial under dryland. Treatments consisted of a once-off application of three levels of dolomitic lime, annual application of two levels of inorganic fertiliser, and three levels of chicken manure. A no-till practice with hand planting and fertiliser application was used. Leaf and soil sampling, as well as harvesting were performed and analyses done. Chicken manure application induced similar maize leaf macro- and micro-nutrient concentrations to the recommended inorganic fertiliser (Frec) level and, in general, significantly higher values than the traditional fertiliser level (Ftrad). Augmenting chicken manure with inorganic nitrogen led to significant increases in leaf nitrogen and phosphorus levels. Grain yields under chicken manure were similar to those under Frec, but far superior to those under Ftrad. It is concluded that under acid soil conditions the improvement of soil fertility, either by organic or inorganic fertiliser application, can result in maize grain yields of about 3 Mg ha-1 under the prevailing rainfall conditions.
