Interactive Correlation Environment (ICE) â€” A Statistical Web Tool for Data Collinearity AnalysisWeb tools for statistical investigation with an interactive and friendly interface enable users without programming knowledge to conduct their analyses. We develop an Interactive Correlation Environment (ICE) in an open access platform to perform spectral collinearity analysis for biogeochemical activity retrieval. We evaluate its performance on different browsers and applied it to retrieve chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration in a tropical reservoir. The use of ICE to retrieve water chl-a concentration got a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) lower than 7% for seasonal datasets, enhancing ICE's ability to adapt it within season. An RMSE of 17% was found for the mixed dataset with a large range of chl-a concentrations. We conclude that the use of ICE is recommended, due to its quick response, easily manipulation, high accuracy, and empirical adaptation to seasonal variability. Its use is enhanced by the development of hyperspectral sensors, which allow the identification of several biogeochemical components, such as chl-a, phycocyanin (PC), soil salinity, soil types, leaf nitrogen, and leaf chl-a concentration.
