Chromosomal homology of Uraeotyphlus oxyurus group of species (Amphibia, Gymnophiona,Â Ichthyophiidae)Abstract Uraeotyphlus oxyurus (Dumeril et Bibron, 1841), Uraeotyphlus interruptus Pillai et Ravichandran, 1999, Uraeotyphlus narayani Seshachar, 1939 and Uraeotyphlus menoni Annandale, 1913 were cytogenetically analysed following conventional and differential staining techniques. These species show similar karyotypes with 2n=36 (FN=58). There were no traces of species-specific features in regard to C-banding and NOR staining. The comparative study of karyotypes shows chromosomal homologies among the four species. Chromosomal data seem to support the concept that two species groups exist in the genus Uraeotyphlus.
