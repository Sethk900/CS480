Aboveground production and species richness of annuals in Chihuahuan Desert grassland and shrubland plant communities.Precipitation variability and shrub encroachment in response to global environmental change are likely to affect both richness and aboveground net primary production (ANPP) of annual plants in arid and semi-arid ecosystems in the northern Chihuahuan Desert, especially given the grazing history and desertification potential of this aridland region. Using a nine-year dataset (1999-2007), we examined the spatial and temporal variation in annual plant communities in grass- and shrub-dominated vegetation, and evaluated the relationships between species richness and ANPP with seasonal and annual precipitation and soil moisture. We found that species richness and ANPP varied among seasons and between years in both grass- and shrub-dominated areas. Cryptantha crassisepala, Plantago patagonica, and Phacelia integrifolia were the most common species found in both communities in both seasons, and Chamaesyce serrula, C. serpyllifolia, and Kallstroemia parviflora were more common in summer only.
