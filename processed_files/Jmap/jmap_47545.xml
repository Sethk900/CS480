Condition factor and diet of the catfish Loricariichthys castaneus (Castelnau, 1855): gender differences in three tropical reservoirsCondition factor and diet of male and female of Loricariichthys castaneus were studied in three tropical reservoirs in which it is the most abundant species of fish. The females had higher condition factors than males in all three environments, but their diet differed from males only in the best-preserved ecosystem (Lajes Reservoir). Loricariichthys castaneus was considered as detritivorous-omnivorous. Starvation during breeding possibly contributes to a decrease of condition factor in males. By studying the gut content, sex-specific foraging and the influence of the diet importance in relation to the available food items in the three reservoirs were analyzed.
