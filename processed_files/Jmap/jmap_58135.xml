Low soil moisture during hot periods drives apparent negative temperature sensitivity of soil respiration in a dryland ecosystem: a multi-model comparisonArid and semiarid ecosystems (drylands) may dominate the trajectory of biosphere-to-atmosphere carbon (C) exchange, and understanding dryland CO2 efflux is important for C cycling at the global-scale. However, unknowns remain regarding how temperature and moisture interact to regulate dryland soil respiration (Rs), while ‘islands of fertility’ in drylands create spatially heterogeneous Rs. At a site in southeastern Utah, USA we added or removed litter (0–650 % of control) in plots associated with either shrubs or biological soil crust-dominated interspaces between vascular plants. We measured Rs, soil temperature (Ts), and water content (h) repeatedly from October 2013 to November 2014. Rs was highest following rain in late summer at Ts *30 C, and lowest mid-summer at Ts [ 40 C, resulting in apparent negative temperature sensitivity of Rs at high temperatures, and positive temperature sensitivity at low-moderate temperatures. We used Bayesian statistical methods to compare models capturing a range of hypothesized relationships between Ts, h, and Rs. The best model indicates that apparent negative temperature sensitivity of Rs at high Ts reflects the control of water content, not high temperatures. Modeled Q10 ranged from 2.7 to 1.4 between 5 and 45 C. Litter addition had no effect on Q10 or reference respiration (Rref = Rs at 20 C and optimum h) beneath shrubs, and little effect on Rref in interspaces, yet Rref was 1.5 times higher beneath shrubs than in interspaces. Altogether, these results suggest reduced Rs often observed at high Ts in drylands is dominated by the control of h, and, on shorter-timescales, variable litter inputs exert minimal control over Rs.
