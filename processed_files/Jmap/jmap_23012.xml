New distributional and bioacoustic data about Cicadivetta goumenissa from Peloponnese, Greece (Hemiptera, Cicadidae)Abstract Cicadivetta goumenissa, a small singing cicada described recently by Gogala et al. (2012), has been previously found only around the village of Goumenissa in northern Peloponnese. We visited this area again in June 2012 and tried to determine the distribution range of this species. We found Cicadivetta goumenissa in some further localities, but all within a very small area of about 15 by 25 km. We also made more than one hour of new song recordings and extended our knowledge of the song repertoire of this species.
