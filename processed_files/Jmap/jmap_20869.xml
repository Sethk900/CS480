A new species of Megachile Latreille subgenus Megachiloides (Hymenoptera, Megachilidae)Abstract A new species of leafcutter bee, Megachile (Megachiloides) chomskyi, is described from Texas, United States. Megachile chomskyi is one of the four known species of the oenotherae species group of Megachiloides, all members sharing the long tongue, and is most similar to Megachile (Megachiloides) amica Cresson. Like other members of the oenotherae species group, this species probably shows oligolecty with Onagraceae (Evening-Primrose Family). A diagnosis, full description of both sexes and a key to the species of the oenotherae species group are provided.
