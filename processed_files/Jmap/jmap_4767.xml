 Hybridization of beaked redfish (Sebastes mentella) with small redfish (Sebastes viviparus) and diversification of redfish (Actinopterygii: Scorpaeniformes) in the Irminger SeaWe searched for Sebastes mentella and Sebastes viviparus hybrids in samples of redfish with external traits typical of S. mentella. The samples were collected in the Irminger Sea in 2007 (n = 131) and 2010 (n = 72). Hybrids were identified using MDH-2* locus coding malate dehydrogenase. Both samples contained hybrids (two and one individuals, respectively). The results of our investigations and previously published data show that interspecific hybridization may have a strong impact on the genetic structure of S. mentella in the Irminger Sea, presumably being one of the main reasons for the differentiation of allele frequencies of some genes between samples collected at different depths. This should be taken into consideration in studies of Irminger Sea redfish.
