Inheritance of flavour in six tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) varietiesFlavour component differences between six tomato varieties and their F1, progenies were investigated. A diallel crossing system, excluding the reciprocal crosses was used. The F-1 and parent varieties were compared by carrying out a sensory evaluation and a chemical component analysis. Statistical analysis of these two data sets revealed significant differences among the F1 and parents for the chemical analysis variables, whereas the sensory variables showed considerably fewer significant differences. The number of correlations found between the chemical analysis and the sensory evaluation were relatively few. In the combining ability analysis, all the chemical analysis variables showed significant differences for general combining ability and specific combining ability. None of the sensory variables showed significant differences for specific combining ability and only one sensory variable, juiciness, showed highly significant differences for general combining ability. Both types of analyses, chemical analysis and sensory evaluations, are important for studies investigating flavour in tomatoes. Sensory evaluations cannot entirely be replaced by chemical analyses.
