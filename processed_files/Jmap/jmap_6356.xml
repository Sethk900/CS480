Season of application and glyphosate formulation as factors influencing the efficacy of glyphosate on phyllode-bearing Australian acaciasInvasive phyllode-bearing Australian acacias are more difficult to control chemically than true-leaved acacias. Indications were that season of application influenced the efficacy of herbicides when used against these plants. In this experiment two formulations of glyphosate (with low and high surfactant concentrations) were applied in four different seasons (spring, late summer, winter and early summer) at four different application rates (720, 1440, 2160 and 2880 g ha−1). A significant (P ≤ 0.001) interaction between season of application, formulation and application rate was found. Significant differences between treatments could only be found in the late summer applications, i.e. after a long, dry spell. Application of glyphosate in the late summer required a dose rate of 2880 g ha−1 of the high surfactant formulation for satisfactory control (> 90%), whereas in other seasons 720 and 1440 g ha−1 of the low surfactant glyphosate formulation controlled the plants satisfactorily. It is therefore advisable not to apply glyphosate to these plants during the hot dry summers of the winter rainfall area in the south-western Cape.
