A new species of the genus Euseius Wainstein (Acari: Phytoseiidae) from FranceThe identity of specimens belonging to the genus Euseius found on several trees in France is investigated. Previous molecular and morphological analyses have shown that the new species herein described is different from Euseius stipulatus. Among the 187 species belonging to the genus Euseius, four of them (Euseius querci, Euseius amissibilis, Euseius kirghisicus and Euseius longiverticalis) seem to be morphologically close to this new species. However, none were very similar. This paper reports the description of this new species: Euseius gallicus sp. nov. Kreiter and Tixier.
