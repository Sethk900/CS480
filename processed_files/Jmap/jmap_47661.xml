Description of Kashmirobroscus gen. nov. with two new species from the Northwest Himalaya, and remarks on the East Asian genus Eobroscus Kryzhanovskij, 1951 (Coleoptera: Carabidae: Broscini)The ground beetle taxon Kashmirobroscus gen. nov. and two species Kashmirobroscus mirabilis sp. nov. and Kashmirobroscus ortrudae sp. nov. are described from the Northwest Himalaya of Pakistan. Diagnostic characters of both new species are figured and their distributional areas are mapped. Several features of the new genus are discussed to work out its systematic position within Broscini. As a result, Kashmirobroscus is proposed as a sister taxon of the East Asian genus Eobroscus Kryzhanovskij, 1951, of the subtribe Broscina. In addition, new data relating to systematics and distribution of all the known species of the genus Eobroscus are provided. The taxon Orobroscus Morita, 1990 is proposed as a junior synonym of Eobroscus Kryzhanovskij, 1951, and Eobroscus uenoi Morita, 1995 is proposed as a junior synonym of Eobroscus bhutanensis Morvan, 1982, a macropterous species with a wide distribution in the eastern parts of High Asia. http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:1775013D-FE87-41CA-87AF-D730E809331B
