Food habits of the threatened bat Leptonycteris nivalis (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae) in a mating roost in MexicoThe objective of this study was to collect and present data on the food plants that a vulnerable migratory nectarivorous bat, Leptonycteris nivalis, used during its seasonal stay at a cave in Tepoztlan, Mexico. This cave is the only mating roost known for this species. Pollen grains from faeces and fur were examined. Little is known about the diet of this bat, especially in the southern half of its distribution. Pollen belonging to 10 plant species was found from five families: Cactaceae (Stenocereus beneckei), Bombacaceae (Ceiba aesculifolia, Pseudobombax ellipticum), Convolvulaceae (Ipomoea arborescens), Fabaceae (Calliandra houstoniana, Bauhinia ungulata), and Amaryllidaceae (Agave dasylirioides, A. horrida, A. inaequidens, A. salmiana). Bats showed the highest dietary diversity in November. There were no significant differences in diet between sexes. Of the four Agave species, two have paniculate inflorescences that are commonly attributed to bat pollination, while the other two had spicate inflorescences, which are considered to be primarily insectâ€pollinated.
