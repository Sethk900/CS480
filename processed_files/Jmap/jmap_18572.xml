SOIL RESPIRATION IN UNDISTURBED AND BURNED AREAS IN A TROPICAL RAIN FOREST ECOSYSTEM IN SOUTHERN BAHIA BRAZILA method of soil respiration measurement was used to estimate the gross primary productivity of a tropical ecosystem in the Southern region of the State of Bahia, Brazil. The role of soil microorganisms in the nutrients cycling was evaluated. Total soil respiration (roots plus soil organisms) and the respiration of soil organisms alone (principally represented by the microorganisms), were determined in both an undisturbed forest and in a burned one. A gross primary productivity of 26.35 ton CO2.cntdot.ha-1.cntdot.yr-1 or 7.18 ton C.cntdot.ha-1.cntdot.yr-1 was shown. The nutrients added to the soil after forest burning, possibly stimulate the microorganisms activity. The difference registered between nighttime and daytime CO2 evolution is considered. The abiotic factors that act on the metabolsim of soil microorganisms are analyzed.
