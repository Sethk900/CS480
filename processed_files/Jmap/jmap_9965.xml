Foraminifera of the Coos Bay Lower Tertiary, Coos County, OregonForaminifera from the lower Tertiary of Coos Bay, Coos County, Oregon, are described and figured. Forty-seven species and subspecies were obtained from 49 samples. Three species are new. Two formations are discussed. The Coaledo, equivalent to the uppermost part of the Arago formation, is Eocene, and the Bastendorf may be Eocene or Oligocene. The beds are correlated in part with the Cowlitz of Washington and the Tejon and Tumey formations of California. An ecological analysis of the association suggests deposition in a shallow temperate sea. A marked change in the faunal complexion which coincides with a coal seam indicates a time-interval in which evolutionary changes took place.
