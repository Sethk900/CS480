Performance of Dry Direct-Seeded Rice in Response to Genotype and Seeding RateDry direct-seeded rice (Oryza sativa L.) (DSR) is an emerging production system in South Asia. Limited research has been done in DSR for optimizing seeding rate to achieve a high yield in South Asia, especially for hybrids. In this study, we investigated yield formation, dry matter, and N translocation of four rice genotypes (two hybrids: ‘PAC-837’ and ‘SVH-127’; two inbreds: ‘PR-115’ and ‘PR-121’) in response to varying seeding rates (80, 120, 160, and 200 seeds m−2). The grain yield of the hybrids was higher (6.84−8.52 Mg ha−1) than that of inbreds (5.41–6.70 Mg ha−1) at each seeding rate; however, the magnitude of the increases in yield was higher at the lowest seeding rate (80 seeds m−2). The highest grain yield was achieved with PAC-837 (8.52 Mg ha−1) at 80 seeds m−2. This was caused by a substantial increase in N uptake (111.6 kg ha−1) and total N uptake (173.2 kg ha−1) for PAC-837 at the lowest seeding rate (80 seeds m−2). Translocation of dry matter (3.70 and 3.37 Mg ha−1 for PAC-837 and SVH-127, respectively) and N accumulation (51.0 and 50.0 kg ha−1 for PAC-837 and SVH-127, respectively) was higher in the hybrids than in inbreds. The results indicated that in DSR, both the hybrids and inbreds showed the highest grain yield at the lowest seeding rate (80 seeds m−2). This study suggested that the grain yield of DSR at 200 seeds m−2 decreased because of lower N translocation and postanthesis N accumulation compared to 80 seeds m−2.
