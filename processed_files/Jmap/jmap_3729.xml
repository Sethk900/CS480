Short-term monitioring of rangeland forage conditions with AVHRR imageryA study was conducted to determine the potential of using  Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery  to monitor short-term changes in rangeland forage conditions on  a regional scale. Forage biomass and nitrogen concentration  were estimated at 6 study sites throughout a typical grazing sea-  son (April to October). Study sites were located in northern and  southern Montana in areas classified as foothills grassland and  shortgrass prairie. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index  (NDVI) values from AVHRR imagery (1 km pixels) were used to  predict live biomass, dead standing biomass, total biomass, nitro-  gen (N) concentration and standing N. Values of the NDVI were  correlated (r > 0.4, P < 0.01) to live, dead, and total biomass esti-  mates and standing N, but were not correlated to N concentra-  tion (r = 0.04, P = 0.8). Relationships between NDVI and vegeta-  tive attributes were similar (P > 0.05) for all 6 study sites, which  indicates that NDVI could be used to predict forage abundance  at multiple locations and at variable dates. Using simple linear  regression, NDVI accounted for 63% of the variation in live and  total biomass, 18% of the variation in dead biomass, 66% of the  variation in standing N, but < 1 % of the variation in N concen-  tration. The NDVI obtained from AVHRR imagery was a good  predictor of forage abundance as measured by live, dead and  total biomass as well as standing N, but it was not related to for-  age quality as measured by N or crude protein concentration. On  a regional basis, land managers could use AVHRR-NDVI values  to identify areas with high or low levels of forage abundance that  may result from factors such as drought, variable precipitation  patterns, or uneven grazing.
