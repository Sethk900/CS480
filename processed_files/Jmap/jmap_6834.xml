Arthropod Biodiversity in the Canopy of Vochysia divergens (Vochysiaceae), a Forest Dominant in the Brazilian PantanalThe canopy of an invasive tree species in the Pantanal floodplains, Vochysia divergens Pohl (Vochysiaceae; height 12 m) was sprayed once with 5% synthetic pyrethrum during the dry, non-flooded season near Pocon√©, Mato Grosso. About 4200 arthropods collected (43.7 ind./m 2) represented 14 orders. The Hymenoptera dominated (21.4 ind./ 2 ; mostly ants), followed by Coleoptera, Araneae and Diptera (85% of the total catch). Of the 26 Coleoptera families (6.2 ind./ 2) the Curculionidae, Scolytidae, Elateridae and Dryopidae were most abundant (70% of the total catch), and on trophic level the herbivores dominated (42%). This is the first quantitative canopy study of a tree species in the northern Pantanal floodplains. The type of data needed on arthropods from tree canopies in future studies to aid in the management and conservation of Pantanal floodplains is discussed.
