Honeybush (Cyclopia spp.) response to phosphorus fertilisation and mulchingHoneybush (Cyclopia spp.) is endemic to the Western- and Eastern Cape where it grows naturally in sandy, acidic, low- phosphorus (P) soils. The effects of different rates of applied P, and of mulches, on the growth of four honeybush species were determined in a field trial. In soils containing around 6 mg P kg−1, the growth of plastic mulched Cyclopia subternata was significantly enhanced by the addition of sufficient P to increase the soil P concentration to 20 mg kg−1. At low (6 mg kg−1) soil P concentrations, mortality rates in honeybush species tended to be lower in sawdust mulched, relative to unmulched and plastic mulched treatments. Mortality was probably associated with a root nematode infestation.
