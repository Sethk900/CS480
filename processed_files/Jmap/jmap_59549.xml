Twin Pines Obsidian: Projectile Points or Ritual Objects?The ritual and ceremonial use of obsidian is historically well documented.  Prehistoric and historic use of obsidian projectile points among indigenous groups of the Americas for ritual and ceremonial purposes is likewise well documented.  Ethnographic evidence is engaged to demonstrate support for the use of obsidian in ritual contexts that are not intended for traditional, utilitarian purposes. This paper summarizes an analysis of obsidian projectile points recovered from the Twin Pines site during 2015 summer field season excavations.  Formal, frequential, variation, and association variables are used to evaluate aspects of artifact life history.  Our analysis uses specific performance characteristics to infer that Twin Pinesâ€™ obsidian points possess design capabilities that make them ineffective for hunting and warfare, thereby indicating their manufacture was intended for non-traditional purposes.
