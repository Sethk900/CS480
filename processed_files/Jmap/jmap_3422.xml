NATAL DISPERSAL AND LEK FIDELITY OF SAGE GROUSENatal dispersal and lek fidelity (attendance within and between years) of Sage Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) were studied on Cold Spring Mountain, northwestern Col- orado, from July 1981 through May 1984. Female Sage Grouse followed the typical avian pattern of dispersing farther than males. However, there was no difference between pro- portions of male and female yearling grouse attending the lek closest to their juvenile banding location. Fifteen percent of all individually marked juveniles (24/157 birds) were known to have attended leks as yearlings. There was no difference between yearling and adult lek attendance rates for either sex; however, females attended leks less often than males. Yearling females, but not yearling males, visited 2 or more leks more often than adults. These differences may be related to yearlings' inexperience with breeding or to a strategy to enhance reproductive success.
