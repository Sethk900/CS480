Relationship between DIMBOA content and atrazine tolerance in maizeData of two independent studies are presented to illustrate the relationship between DIMBOA content of maize inbreds and their tolerance to atrazine. Polynomial regression curves best described this relationship. R-squared values of 0,48 and 0,87 between DIMBOA content and tolerance were obtained when atrazine was applied at 3 and 6 ppm v/v respectively.
