New North American Chrysauginae (Pyralidae) described by E.D. CashattAbstract A Ph.D. dissertation completed by E.D. Cashatt in 1968 entitled â€œRevision of the Chrysauginae of North Americaâ€ does not meet the criteria of publication so the new taxa described therein are not available per the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. In order to validate the taxa proposed in that document we formally describe and illustrate the following: Arta brevivalvalis Cashatt, sp. n., Heliades lindae Cashatt, sp. n., Paragalasa Cashatt, gen. n., Paragalasa exospinalis Cashatt, sp. n., and Penthesilea sacculalis baboquivariensis Cashatt, subsp. n. We summarize other taxonomic actions proposed in the dissertation and those proposed by subsequent authors. We provide the current nomenclatural status with the literature citation of the paper in which the current status was proposed. A lectotype is designated for Clydonopteran tecomae. Adult holotypes and associated labels, and genitalia of paratypes are newly illustrated.
