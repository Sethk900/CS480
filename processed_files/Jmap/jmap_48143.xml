Peninsular patterns in biological diversity: historical arrangement, methodological approaches and causal processesPrior research has indicated that peninsula(r) effects appear to be idiosyncratic, depending on context, taxa, scales, and taxonomic levels. In this review (87 papers; 1950 to 2013) I report a historical arrangement of causal processes inducing diversity patterns that may be grouped as: (1) recent stochastic processes (equilibrium and derived island biogeography theories); (2) historical events (palaeoclimatic and palaeogeographic changes); (3) recent deterministic processes with a geographical baseâ€“tip gradient; and (4) anthropogenic recent processes. Patterns in species diversity have also been reported for ecological habitat peninsulas on the mainland. Here, mainly anthropogenic causal mechanisms at landscape/patch scale may be hypothesized, with implications in multiscale conservation strategies and applied biogeography. Peninsular studies must overcome weaknesses in methodological approaches regarding the definition of peninsular border and scales, the procedures of setting data and analyses, inadequate data and taxonomic uncertainty, and standardized sampling efforts.
