Influence of Nutrient Availability on the Interaction Between Spotted Knapweed and Bluebunch WheatgrassCentaurea maculosa\r\n(Lam.) (spotted knapweed) reduces\r\nwildlife and livestock habitat biodiversity and increases\r\nerosion. Nutrient availability to plants may be used to accelerate\r\nsuccession away from spotted knapweed. Earlysuccessional\r\nplant communities often have high nutrient\r\navailability, whereas late-successional communities are\r\noften found on lower nutrient soils. We hypothesized\r\nthat removal of nutrients would change the competitive\r\nadvantage from spotted knapweed to\r\nPseudoroegneria\r\nspicatum\r\n(bluebunch wheatgrass) (late seral). In two\r\naddition series matrices, background densities of\r\nSecale\r\ncereale\r\n(annual rye) and\r\nElymus elimoides\r\n(bottlebrush\r\nsquirreltail) (3,000 seeds/m\r\n2\r\n) were used to remove\r\nnutrients from the soil. In another set of addition\r\nseries matrices, nitrogen (33 kg/ha) or phosphorus (33\r\nkg/ha) were added to the soil. Nutrient analysis of soil\r\nand vegetation indicated that annual rye and bottlebrush\r\nsquirreltail reduced nutrient availability in\r\nsoils. In another matrix, neither a background density\r\nnor nutrients were added. Data were fit into Watkinsonâ€™s\r\ncurvilinear model to determine the competitive\r\nrelationship between bluebunch wheatgrass and spotted\r\nknapweed. This allowed comparison of the equivalence\r\nratios (C) generated from each addition series.
