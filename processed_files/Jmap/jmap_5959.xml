Assessment of terrestrial laser scanning technology for obtaining high-resolution DEMs of soilsTerrestrial Laser Scanners (TLS) provide a non-contact method to measure soil microtopography of relatively large sur- face areas. The appropriateness of the technology in relatation to the derived Digital Elevation Models (DEM) however has not been reported. The suitability of TLS for soil microtopography measurements was tested on-field for three large soil surface areas in agricul- tural fields. The acquired point clouds were filtered with a custom cloud import algorithm, and converted into digital elevation models (DEM) of different resolutions. To assess DEMquality, point clouds measured from different viewpointswere statistically compared. The statistical fit between point clouds from different viewpoints depends on spatial resolution of the DEM. The best resultswere obtained at the higher resolutions (0.02 to 0.04cm),where less than 5%of the grid cells showed significant differences between one viewpoint and the next (p<0.01).
