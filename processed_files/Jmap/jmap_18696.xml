BELOWGROUND CARBON ALLOCATION IN UNFERTILIZED AND FERTILIZED RED PINE PLANTATIONS IN NORTHERN WISCONSINWe estimated carbon allocation to belowground processes in unfertilized and fertilized red pine (Pinus resinosa Air.) plantations in northern Wisconsin to determine how soil fertility affects belowground allocation patterns. We used soil CO2 eMux and litterfall measurements to estimate total belowground carbon allocation (root production and root respiration) by the carbon balance method, established root-free trenched plots to examine treatment effects on microbial respiration, estimated fine root production by sequential coring, and developed allometric equations to estimate coarse root production. Fine root production ranged from 150 to 284 g m(-2) year(-1) and was significantly lower for fertilized plots than for unfertilized plots. Coarse root production ranged from 60 to 90 gm(-2)year(-1) and was significantly lower for fertilized plots than for unfer tiIized plots. Annual soil CO2 fluxes ranged from 331 to 541 g C (m-2)year(-1) and were significantly lower for fertilized plots than for unfertilized plots. Annual foliage litterfall ranged from 110 to 187 g C m-2 year(-1) and was significantly greater for fertilized plots than for unfertilized plots. Total belowground carbon allocation ranged from 188 to 395 g C m-2 year(-1) and was significantly lower for fertilized plots than for unfertilized plots. Annual soil CO2 flux was lower for trenched plots than for untrenched plots but did not differ between fertilized and unfertilized trenched plots. Collectively, these independent estimates suggest that fertilization decreased the relative allocation of carbon belowground.
