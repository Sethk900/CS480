Two new species of Diaptomidae (Crustacea: Copepoda: Calanoida) from the Neotropical Region (ParanÃ¡ River)Two new species of Diaptomidae were found in the Middle ParanÃ¡ River. The new species are referred to as â€œDiaptomusâ€ curvatus sp. nov. and â€œDiaptomusâ€ frutosae sp. nov. Important character states in â€œDiaptomusâ€ curvatus include: right fifth leg with a well-developed endopod and with the lateral spine of the second exopod segment curved and longer than the segment on which it is inserted, plus the presence of a large dorsal process on urosomite 4 of the male. For â€œDiaptomusâ€ frutosae they include: a differentiated hook-like process on segment 20 with chitinous protuberances at base of male right antennule; the last segment of the right leg 5 of male is triangular, and the lateral spine inserted distal to mid-level of this segment. Both species are placed in â€œDiaptomusâ€ sensu lato as a temporary placement. http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:FECDD6C4-C0AC-4043-ADDD-F29539B451F0
