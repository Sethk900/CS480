A new species of the genus Sulawesifulvius Gorczyca, Chérot, &amp; Štys, 2004 (Insecta, Heteroptera, Miridae, Cylapinae) from IndiaThe monotypic genus Sulawesifulvius was erected by Gorczyca et al. (2004) to accommodate the new plant bug species Sulawesifulvius schuhi Gorczyca, Chérot & Štys, 2004 from Nani Wartabone National Park, Sulawesi (Indonesia).  Recently, two specimens of an unknown cylapine were collected by the first author in Hessaraghatta, near Bangalore, South India. These Indian specimens conform to the original generic diagnosis of the genus Sulawesifulvius. However, the genital structures of the male holotype, especially the parameres, are different and much simpler than the male genitalia of S. schuhi. Consequently, we describe these specimens as a new species of Sulawesifulvius.
