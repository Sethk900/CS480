On the identity of Pterodectes ralliculae Atyeo and Gaud, 1977 (Astigmata: Proctophyllodidae)The feather mite Pterodectes ralliculae Atyeo and Gaud, 1977 (Proctophyllodidae: Pterodectinae) is the only proctophyllodid known from rallids (Gruiformes, Rallidae). Based on re-examination of the type material, this mite species is redescribed and transferred to the genus Montesauria Oudemans, 1905, Montesauria ralliculae (Atyeo and Gaud, 1977) comb. nov. This redescription brings details of structures missed in the original description: in both sexes, vertical setae ve are present, setae mG on genu II, gT on tibia II and wa on tarsi I and II are present; in males, the rudimentary epimeral sclerites rEpIIa are present and the female is illustrated for the first time. The transfer of P. ralliculae to Montesauria was also supported by the preliminary phylogenetic hypothesis recently proposed for the subfamily Pterodectinae.
