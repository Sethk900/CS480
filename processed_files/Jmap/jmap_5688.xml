Rehabilitation of Bryconaethiops yseuxi Boulenger, 1899 (Characiformes: Alestidae) from the Congo River basin, AfricaBryconaethiops yseuxi Boulenger, 1899, originally described from â€œHaut Congoâ€, is rehabilitated. The species was synonymized, successively with B. microstoma (GÃ¼nther, 1873) and B. macrops Boulenger, 1920, subsequently rehabilitated, and then again considered as a junior synonym of B. microstoma. Bryconaethiops yseuxi is here considered as a valid species, easily distinguished from all other Bryconaethiops species by its small size (maximum: 72.2Â mm SL), 7.5 rows of scales between the dorsalâ€fin origin and the lateral line; 11â€“13/1/8â€“12 gill rakers on the first gill arch and long dorsalâ€fin and analâ€fin bases, respectively, 15.7â€“17.6% of SL and 22.7â€“25.9% of SL.
