Annual Variation of Soil Respiration and Precipitation in a Temperate Forest (Quercus serrata and Carpinus laxiflora) Under East Asian Monsoon ClimateThe consequence of changing pattern of precipitation on soil CO(2) emission is poorly understood in montane forest ecosystems under monsoon climate in Asia. In this paper, the results of 3-year field measurements are reported on the annual soil respiration (R (s)) from a temperate deciduous broad-leaved forest (Quercus serrata and Carpinus laxiflora) in Korea, and its interannual variations are examined associated with changing precipitation. Based on biweekly chamber measurements from 2001 to 2004, the annual soil CO(2) emission averaged to be 7.8 t C ha(-1) with an annual variability of similar to 20%. The soil temperature explained 22-97% of seasonal variations of R (s) each year whereas the water-filled porosity (WFP) and precipitation pattern had a major effect on the observed interannual variation. The optimum values of WFP during the main growing season depended not only on the amount but also on the intensity and frequency of precipitation. These results indicate that the changes in catchment hydrology can significantly alter the carbon sink/source strength of forest ecosystems in monsoon Asia.
