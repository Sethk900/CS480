Two sympatric new species of woodlizards (Hoplocercinae, Enyalioides ) from Cordillera Azul National Park in northeastern PeruAbstract We report the discovery of two sympatric new species of Enyalioides from a montane rainforest of the RÃ­o Huallaga basin in northeastern Peru. Among other characters, the first new species is distinguishable from other Enyalioides by the combination of the following characters: strongly keeled ventral scales, more than 37 longitudinal rows of dorsals in a transverse line between the dorsolateral crests at midbody, low vertebral crest on the neck with vertebrals on neck similar in size to those between hind limbs, projecting scales on body or limbs absent, 96 mm maximum SVL in both sexes, and caudals increasing in size posteriorly within each autotomic segment. The second new species differs from other species of Enyalioides in having strongly keeled ventral scales, scales posterior to the superciliaries forming a longitudinal row of strongly projecting scales across the lateral edge of the skull roof in adults of both sexes, 31 or fewer longitudinal rows of strongly keeled dorsals in a transverse line between the dorsolateral crests at midbody, vertebrals on neck more than five times the size of vertebrals between hind limbs in adult males, projecting scales on body or limbs absent, and caudals increasing in size posteriorly within each autotomic segment. We also present an updated molecular phylogenetic tree of hoplocercines including new samples of Enyalioides rudolfarndti, Enyalioides rubrigularis, both species described in this paper, as well as an updated identification key for species of Hoplocercinae.
