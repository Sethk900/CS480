Threshold of Basin Discretization Levels for HSPF Simulations with NEXRAD InputsAbstractBasin discretization effects in HSPF simulations were investigated to provide useful insights for hydrologists to determine the proper catchment size for basin scale modeling. The next generation radar (NEXRAD) rainfall estimates were incorporated into the HSPF modeling environment to generate streamflows at various catchments sizes ranging from 37 to 2,484  km2. This research aims to identify how HSPF model performance can be improved by a marginal level of spatial discretization in rainfall-runoff modeling. Parameter estimation software was used for model calibration using data periods from 1998 to 2000. All simulations at different discretization levels above approximately 23% of the basin size resulted in good statistical values, with correlation coefficients of 0.82–0.87 and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients of 0.61–0.73. However, the modeling performances of HSPF are limited when the catchment size reaches below 8.18% of the basin size, regardless of automatic calibration efforts. The result indicates that basin discretization at finer scales does not necessarily improve HSPF simulation results with NEXRAD inputs.
