Fire behavior characteristics of buffelgrass-fueled fires and native plant community composition in invaded patchesBuffelgrass invasions have been documented in Australia to North America, pointing to an end result of large-scale wildfires. In heavily populated areas such as Nogales, Sonora and Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona buffelgrass populations are growing exponentially. Although much research has been conducted on buffelgrass, relatively little is known about fire behaviors produced by a buffelgrass-fueled fire. To determine which abiotic and biotic characteristics best predict fire behavior, fire-behavior characteristics were measured in four prescribed fires in southern Arizona. Given that buffelgrass is known to decrease native plant richness in other ecosystems, the relationship between buffelgrass abundance and native plant cover was evaluated. Buffelgrass fires are more intense than fires in surrounding ecosystems, even in communities with comparable fuels. There is a strong negative relationship between buffelgrass cover and native plant cover. In addition, buffelgrass appears to be invading favorable microsites rather than species-poor communities and is radiating from the former sites. Historically, fire was rare in arid regions, but with the increase in fuels and because arid regions have weather that promotes intense fire behavior, as observed in this study, managers will increasingly observe and need to mitigate hazardous fires.
