A new species of Tychobythinus Ganglbauer, 1896 (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae: Pselaphinae) from TurkeyAbstract A new species of the genus Tychobythinus Ganglbauer, 1896, Tychobythinus oculatus sp. n., is described from near Köyceğiz, Muğla Province, in southwestern Turkey. The new species is morphologically closely related to Tychobythinus abnormipes Reitter, 1910, and Tychobythinus pauper Kiesenwetter, 1858, but can be readily distinguished from both by having very simplified internal armature of the aedeagus, and by the specific shape of the gular depression.
