Are Bioretention Cells Being Installed Per Design Standards in North Carolina? A Field StudyAbstractForty-three bioretention cells (BRCs) throughout North Carolina were assessed for maintenance needs, soil media composition, and as-built surface storage volume to determine whether BRCs are typically constructed per their intended design specifications. Visual inspections identified hydric soils and redoximorphic features (indicators of prolonged anaerobic conditions) and quantified the occurrence of issues requiring maintenance. Particle-size distribution and permeability of soil media were measured at multiple locations within each cell, and topographic surveys were performed to calculate as-built surface storage volumes. Field drawdown tests were used to verify permeability measurements and assess overall BRC function. Of the studied cells, 22% contained redoximorphic features in the upper 30 cm, and 53% were in need of maintenance due to one or more factors. Although 71% of assessed cells failed to meet soil media particle-size distribution specifications, 98% of BRCs contained media with adequate or high permeability. Over half (65%) of cells were undersized vis-à-vis intended design, with 53% exhibiting moderately or severely undersized surface storage capacity. Discrepancies in average ponding depth and incorporation of inspection/maintenance programs significantly influenced the accuracy of as-built BRC storage volume; therefore, it is important for inspectors to verify that the bed elevations of BRCs have been accurately graded. Despite being typically undersized, it was concluded that most observed bioretention cells are meeting the hydrologic goals of North Carolina standards.
