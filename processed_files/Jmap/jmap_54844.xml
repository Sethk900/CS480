Amount and composition of clay-associated soil organic matter in a range of kaolinitic and smectitic soilsIn the global carbon cycle, soil organic matter (SOM) is a major source/sink of atmospheric carbon. Clay minerals stabilize part of the SOM through mineralâ€“organic matter binding. Stabilization of organic matter is essential for tropical soils. Since the climatic conditions of the tropics favor decomposition of organic matter, tropical soils would be very poor in organic matter without this stabilization process. This research aims at determining the effect of clay mineralogy on the amount and composition of organic matter that is bound to the mineral surface. We focused on organic matter that is associated with kaolinite and smectite. We characterized kaolinite- and smectite-associated SOM in soils from seven countries, employing 13C NMR spectroscopy and Py-GC/MS. The content of carbon in the total clay-size fraction showed no significant difference between kaolinitic and smectitic soils. This suggests that the total amount of organic carbon in the clay-size fraction is independent of the clay mineralogy. We first extracted the clay fraction with NaOH and thereafter with Na4P2O7. About half of the kaolinite-associated SOM was extractable by NaOH. In the smectitic soils, pyrophosphate extracted more organic carbon than did NaOH. The Py-GC/MS and NMR results indicate that kaolinite-associated SOM is enriched in polysaccharide products, while smectite-associated organic matter contains many aromatic compounds. We suggest that different clay minerals use different binding mechanisms to complex SOM. As a result, the composition of clay-associated organic matter would be influenced by the type of clay that is dominantly present in the soil.
