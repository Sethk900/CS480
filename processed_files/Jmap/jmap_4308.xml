Mantispa minuta Fabricius (Neuroptera: Mantispidae) on Egg Sacs of the Orb-Weaver Spider Parawixia bistriata (Araneidae) in Forests of Eucalyptus grandis in BrazilThis is the first report of the interaction between the two entomophagous agents Mantispa minuta Fabricius (Mantispidae) and Parawixia bistriata Rengger, an orb-weaver spider (Araneidae). From egg sacs kept in the laboratory we observed the emergence of adult neuropterans followed by the emergence of a high number of spiderlings. This association illustrates the interactions among the invertebrate predators coexisting in Eucalyptus plantations managed without chemical treatment, in the State of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.
