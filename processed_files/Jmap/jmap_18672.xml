Carbon dioxide diffusion from peat-muck soils: III. Carbon dioxide balance in a model ecosystem of peat meadowCarbon mineralization and balance was estimated in ecosystems of reclaimed mown meadows in the Biebrza River valley (north-western Poland) over the period 1981-1983. The processes were correlated with changes in habitat moisture. Losses of peat deposit and carbon mineralization were low at a very moist (moss) station. Compensation of carbon losses by inflowing fresh, above - and underground plant matter exceeded 70% there. In habitats where a temporary water deficiency occurred, compensation of carbon losses accounted merely for 28%. Contribution of roots to total soil respiration in vegetative season amounted, on the average, to 52%.
