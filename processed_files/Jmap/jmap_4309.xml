The Neotropical Leafhopper Genus Deltolidia Nielson (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae: Coelidiinae): Polymorphism and Taxonomic NotesIntraspecific polymorphic features of color pattern, forewing venation, and male genitalia in the Neotropical genus Deltolidia Nielson are described and illustrated for the first time. Deltolidia magnifica Nielson, 1996 is synonymized with Deltolidia discolor (Stål, 1862). These were the only previously recognized species in the genus. The study is based on specimens from the Brazilian states of Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo, including the types of D. discolor and D. magnifica. Structures of the female genitalia in Deltolidia are described and illustrated for the first time. A map showing the known distribution of the genus is also presented.
