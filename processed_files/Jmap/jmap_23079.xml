First records and description of metallic red females of Euglossa (Alloglossura) gorgonensis Cheesman, with notesÂ on color variation within the species (Hymenoptera, Apidae)Abstract Metallic coloration is one of the signatures of orchid bees of the genus Euglossa, with some species showing variation associated with their geographic range. Euglossa (Alloglossura) gorgonensis Cheesman exhibits color variation, ranging from mainly green specimens in the southern extreme of its range (Pacific slope of Colombia), to noticeably reddish specimens in parts of the northern known limits of its range (Pacific slope of southern Costa Rica). Here we present the first description of females from Costa Rica belonging to the reddish extreme of the color variation.
