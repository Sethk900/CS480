Phylogeny of Chone Kr√∏yer, 1856 (Polychaeta: Sabellidae) and related generaAn analysis was undertaken to test the monophyly of the sabellid genus Chone Kr√∏yer using maximum parsimony methodology. Cladistic analysis revealed three monophyletic genera whose respective members were assigned previously to Chone. Chone sensu stricto (containing the type species) is defined by the presence of broadly rounded dorsal lips and thoracic uncini with a large tooth above the main fang, followed by a series of smaller teeth. Dialychone Clapar√®de is re‚Äestablished for the second genus and a new name ‚Äì Paradialychone ‚Äì is proposed for terminals nested in the third clade. Dialychone and Paradialychone gen. nov. are the sister groups of Chone, defined by the presence of a simple pre‚Äpygidial depression and modified posterior abdominal uncini. Amphicorina Clapar√®de is basal within Sabellinae and Euchone Malmgren is the sister group of Chone, Paradialychone gen. nov. and Dialychone. The analysis supports the transfer of C. princei and C. reayi to Jasmineira Langerhans.
