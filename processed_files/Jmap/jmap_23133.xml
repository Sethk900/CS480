Redescription of Mymarilla Westwood, new synonymies under Cremnomymar Ogloblin (Hymenoptera, Mymaridae) and discussion of unusual wingsAbstract The monotypic genus Mymarilla Westwood is known only from St. Helena, a remote island in the South Atlantic Ocean. The peculiar species M. wollastoni Westwood (Mymaridae) is redescribed and illustrated from non-type material. Mymarilla is compared with Cremnomymar Ogloblinspp. from the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands in the South Pacific Ocean. Stephanodes Enock is shown to be the most likely sister genus to Mymarilla. Nesopolynema Ogloblin, syn. n., Oncomymar Ogloblin, syn. n., Scolopsopteron Ogloblin, syn. n., are placed in synonymy under Cremnomymar and their species transferred as Cremnomymar caudatum (Ogloblin 1952), comb. n., C. dipteron (Ogloblin 1957), comb. n., and C. kuscheli (Ogloblin 1952), comb. n. Wing shape and wing reductions in Mymaridae are discussed in relation to biogeography, particularly with respect island faunas and to four genera, Cremnomymar, Mymarilla, Parapolynema Fidalgo, and Richteria Girault, some or all of whose species have more or less convex fore wings.
