Litter decomposition in cut and uncut western juniper woodlands.The expansion of western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis ssp. occidentalis Hook.) in the northern Great Basin has resulted in management efforts to reduce juniper by prescribed fire or tree cutting to restore shrub-grassland plant communities. Herbaceous succession following juniper cutting or prescribed fire has been well documented, however, impacts of these disturbances to litter and nutrient cycling is limited in these invasive semi-arid woodlands. This study evaluated the effects of cutting juniper trees on leaf litter decomposition and nitrogen (N) dynamics over a 2-year period in eastern Oregon, USA. Litter bags were used to measure juniper leaf litter decomposition and track litter carbon (C) and N fluxes in cut and uncut juniper woodland treatments. Litter mass loss was 37% greater in the cut treatment compared to the uncut treatment after 2 years. Greater litter inputs, higher litter fall quality, and micro-environmental differences were suggested to have been the main causes for the higher litter decomposition rate in the cut treatment. In both treatments, litter N was released by the second year of decomposition, though N release was greater in the uncut treatment. Retention of juniper debris on site permits storage and release of nutrients through decomposition processes which is likely important in maintaining site productivity.
