Radial Dispersion of Neighbors and the Small-Scale Competitive Impact of Two Annual Grasses on a Native Perennial Grass.In California's Mediterranean type grasslands, native perennial grasses such as <em>Nassella pulchra</em> are surrounded by introduced annual species and these annuals are thought to have displaced natives through much of their range. Amongst other invaders, two grasses <em>Lolium multiflorum</em> and <em>Bromus hordeaceus</em>, commonly dominate portions of the grassland with potential for <em>N. pulchra</em> restoration. We hypothesized that competitor species differences and small-scale gaps (150 cm<sup>2</sup>) could be important determinants of <em>N. pulchra</em> survival and performance on these sites. <em>Lolium multiflorum</em> and <em>B. hordeaceus</em> were planted in 20 cm diameter circular plots at a constant rate of 1 seed per cm<sup>2</sup> surrounding newly transplanted <em>N. pulchra</em> plants. <em>Nassella pulchra</em> showed no significant effect of the species of competitor or from the distribution of the competitors. Both interspersion of patches of bare ground and separation of competitors into patches did not increase <em>N. pulchra</em> pre-dawn water potential, basal area change, number of seeds produced, or average weight of seeds. The presence of <em>L. multiflorum</em> was associated with a decrease in <em>N. pulchra</em> survival compared with plots with only <em>B. hordeaceus</em>. Plants with increases in basal area of less than 0.75 cm<sup>2</sup> during the growing season had 74% mortality compared with no mortality in plants with more growth. However, initial <em>N. pulchra</em> plant size was not a good predictor of mortality. Limiting competition from annuals may increase survival of <em>N. pulchra</em> plantings, but 60% of the plants survived for at least 1 year, despite being transplanted into soil containing substantial annual grass seed.
