Barnacles (Crustacea: Cirripedia) from Conic Island Cave, Hong KongTwo species of barnacles (Cirripedia) have been collected from Conic Island Cave, Hong Kong, at depths of between âˆ’11.8 and âˆ’18.2Â m C.D. These are Armatobalanus quadrivittatus (Darwin) and Tetraclitella pilsbryi (Utinomi). Neither is a cave endemic. Armatobalanus quadrivittatus ranges widely throughout the Indoâ€West Pacific and T. pilsbryi is restricted to the Sinoâ€Japanese region (the East and South China Seas and waters of southern Japan) although both are typical of hypobiotic niches. Armatobalanus quadrivittatus has not hitherto been recorded from Hong Kong and its occurrence here brings the local total of barnacle species to 60.
