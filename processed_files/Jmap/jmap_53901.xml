Regional distribution of halogens in Norwegian forest soilsRegional distribution of chlorine, bromine, and iodine in humus layers of Norwegian forest soils has been studied by means of neutron activation analysis. The halogen concentrations show a rapid decrease at increasing distances from the ocean, indicating that the supply of these elements to the soil is mainly through precipitation. Strong correlations between Cl and exchangeable Na+ and Mg2+, indicate atmospheric input to soils for these two cations as well.
