Psechrus kunmingensis: description of male and supplementary description of female, with discussion on intraspecific variation (Araneae, Psechridae, Psechrus)Abstract Psechrus kunmingensis Yin, Wang & Zhang, 1985 was first described from the female only. The first illustration of the male appeared without any text description and lacked other critical information. For this study, we collected fresh specimens of this species from diverse localities around Yunnan Province, China. Here, the male is described in detail for the first time and a supplementary description of the female is given. Based on the largest collection of Psechrus kunmingensis specimens ever assembled, we found a remarkably high level of morphological variation in this species.
