Rapid and Approximate Hydrologic Analysis Using Web-Based Data and ToolsAbstractPreliminary site design, emergency response, or engineering operations in remote locations may require a rapid hydrologic analysis to provide decision-support information on a siteâ€™s suitability for various improvements. This paper describes a procedure for conducting such analyses using widely available Internet-based data and tools. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the reader to the steps necessary to execute a hydrologic analysis remotely. The analysis presented was conducted using programs typically found on any computer or that can be downloaded on short notice from the Internet. Freely available online geospatial data were used to create a database of hydrologic conditions at remotely identified points of interest. These points of interest were compared to actual hydrologic databases for sections of Interstate 25 in New Mexico and State Route M-131 in Michigan. The results of the remote hydrologic analysis correctly identified and analyzed 78% of actual physical locations of culverts for the New Mexico site. Due to increased difficulty of visual identification caused by the density of land cover in a more humid climate, the remote hydrologic analysis technique correctly identified 55% of actual physical locations of culverts for the Michigan site. Potential methods to improve the accuracy of the technique are discussed.
