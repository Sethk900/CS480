Genetic variability of wild Agave angustifolia populations based on AFLP: A basic study for conservation.Agave angustifolia is taken from wild populations in the desert of Sonora, Mexico, to make the alcoholic drink known as "bacanora". An increase in the demand for this beverage has led to overexploitation of these agaves. We used AFLP to measure the genetic variability within and between natural populations of the species. The fixation index (FST) and population genetic distances (GD) were determined for three populations of A. angustifolia. At the clonal level, the expected heterozygosis (HE), the proportion of polymorphic loci (P), and the genetic similarity indices (GSIs) were lower in one population. Total GSI for adults and offshoots was 0.924. There were no differences in the GSI within or between the populations and dendrogram showed three groups that partially reflect the geographical distribution of the populations. Some degree of genetic variation between mother plants and their vegetatively produced rhizomes was observed. At the species level, total expected heterozygosity was high (HT = 0.314) with a P value of 78%, and intermediate gene flow (Nm = 1.18), giving rise to a moderate fixation index (FST = 0.175). Nm, FST and GD values observed, indicate that urgent measures must be implemented to preserve the genetic diversity.
