â€œWaterhardâ€: A hard brown layer in sand below peat, The NetherlandsField observations were made and samples collected for laboratory study of â€œwaterhardâ€ layers in an area in northeastern Netherlands. â€œWaterhardâ€ is a brown, discontinuous, cemented layer in cover sands below the contact with a former or present peat blanket. The upper boundary is sharp and generally straight and level but has a striking â€œbow-shapeâ€ in places. Also sharp, the lower boundary is wavy and follows stratification in the sands. Layers of â€œwaterhardâ€ do not occur in sequence with soil horizons nor do they conform to the topography of the land surface. In the study area, the layers occur under flanks of ridges and slightly elevated positions but not in depressions. Laboratory studies provide further information on the nature of â€œwaterhardâ€ and its probable time of formation. Micromorphological examination shows the brown colour to be due to organic matter resembling dopplerite and occurring both as coatings of and infillings among quartz grains. Contents of organic matter range from 1.3% to 4.7%. Submicroscopic examination shows appreciable amounts of aluminium in the organic materials. The C-14 ages of the organic materials in several samples from one vertical section suggest that formation of â€œwaterhardâ€ followed formation of the peat. Hydraulic conductivity of â€œwaterhardâ€ samples is low enough so that the layers would obstruct water movement.
