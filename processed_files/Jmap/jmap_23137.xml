New and little known species of oribatid mites of the family Haplozetidae (Acari, Oribatida) from EcuadorAbstract We described two new species, Haplozetes paraminimicoma sp. n. and Protoribates ecuadoriensis sp. n. from Ecuador. Additionally, a detailed supplementary description of Trachyoribates (Rostrozetes) glaber (Beck, 1965) is given on the basis of Ecuadorian specimens, which was known previously only from Peru. An annotated checklist of all identified taxa of Haplozetidae from Ecuador is presented.
