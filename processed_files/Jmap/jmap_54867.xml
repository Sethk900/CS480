Disaggregating local knowledge: the effects of gendered farming practices on soil fertility and soil reaction in SW HungarySoil sampling and analysis of hydromorphic meadow soils were combined with semi-structured interviews to discern the multiple forms of local agricultural practices and knowledge in a community located in SW Hungary. Particular attention was extended to the role of gender in affecting soil management and knowledge and thereby soil reaction and fertility. The findings suggest that gender-specific forms of soil management directly alter soil status with lowered pH and macronutrient values in male-controlled cash-crop plots and excessive amounts of P2O5 on female-controlled subsistence plots. General soil classification likewise varied according to gender. To determine soil productivity potential, women mostly relied on a conventional economic index (the Gold Crown system) and general descriptive terminology, while men tended to be sensitised to soil texture. As the study is not based on an extensive survey, the results presented here should be considered preliminary and further expansion of interviews and soil sampling will be attempted in the future. These results nevertheless indicate that examining variability within local soil management systems is crucial to understanding anthropogenic impacts on soil dynamics.
