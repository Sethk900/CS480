The external morphology of Austroplatypus incompertus (Schedl) (Coleoptera, Curculionidae, Platypodinae)Abstract Previous descriptions of adult Austroplatypus incompertus (Schedl) are completed by the addition of descriptions and illustrations of the adults and, in particular, their maxillary palps. I describe and illustrate the non-adult phases of the life cycle and provide a key to the larval instars. The sexual dimorphism of Austroplatypus incompertus is atypical and includes a latitudinal cline which obeys Bergmannâ€™s rule. The taxonomic position of the genus within the Platypodinae is clarified. Platypus incostatus Schedl is recognised as the male of the species, and hence a new synonym of Austroplatypus incompertus.
