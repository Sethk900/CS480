Integrated Surface–Groundwater Model for Storm-Water Harvesting Using Basic Mass Balance PrinciplesAbstractStorm-water harvesting from a pond for irrigation of adjacent lands is promoted as one way that may reduce pond discharge while supplementing valuable potable water used for irrigation. Reduction of pond discharge reduces the mass of pollutants in the discharge. In this study, a storm water harvesting and assessment for reduction of pollution (SHARP) model was developed to predict operation of a wet pond used for storm-water harvesting at Miramar Lakes, Miramar, FL. The model integrates the interaction of surface water and groundwater in a catchment area. The SHARP model was calibrated and validated for pond-water elevation. Model evaluation showed adequate prediction of pond-water elevation with root mean square error (RMSE) between 0.07 and 0.12 m, mean absolute error (MAE) between 0.018 and 0.07 m, and relative index of agreement (drel) between 0.74 and 0.98 for both calibration and validation periods. The SHARP model is capable of assessing harvest safe yield and discharge from a pond, including the prediction of the percentage of runoff into a harvesting pond that is not discharged.
