Cultivation, nitrogen fertilization, and set-aside effects on methane uptake in a drained marsh soil in Northeast China.To evaluate the effect of cultivation, nitrogen fertilizer, and set aside on CH<sub>4</sub> uptake after drained marshland was converted into agricultural fields, CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes and CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations in soil gas were <em>in situ</em> measured in a drained marsh soil, a set-aside cultivated soil, and cultivated soils in Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China in August 2001. Over the measuring period, the highest CH<sub>4</sub> uptake rate was 120.7±6.2 &mu;g CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-;2</sup> h<sup>-;1</sup> in the drained marsh soil and the lowest was 29.5±4.9 &mu;g CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-;2</sup> h<sup>-;1</sup> in the set-aside cultivated soil, showing that there was no significant recovery of CH<sub>4</sub> uptake ability 5 years after cultivation activity was stopped. CH<sub>4</sub> uptake rates were significantly less in the cultivated soils than in the drained marsh soil by 30.1-74.6%, which resulted mainly from cultivation and partly from nitrogen addition. A significantly negative correlation between CH<sub>4</sub> flux and bulk density in the cultivated soils tilled by machine suggests that cultivation reduced CH<sub>4</sub> uptake through compaction, because of the enhanced diffusion resistance for CH<sub>4</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>. Nitrogen fertilization slowly reduced but persistently affected CH<sub>4</sub> uptake even after long-term application of nitrogen.
