Variability of the Fagaga series soils of Western SamoaThe Fagaga series occupies some 320 km2 or 11% of Western Samoa. An examination of 6 pedons, 5 from Upolu and one from Savai'i showed that at least two major taxonomic soil classes could be separated within the Fagaga mapping unit on the basis of chemical and mineralogical properties. Three of the pedons studied were Oxisols (Acroperox), two were Inceptisols (Humitropepts) and one was classified as an Andisol. A number of the differences can be explained in terms of additions of volcanic ash to some of the pedons leading to the presence of andic features in the upper sections of the pedons. A major difference in the two groups of soils is the level of bases, with the Oxisols having extremely low values (Σ bases < 0.2 cmol kg−1). The presence of two different soils within the mapping unit should be recognized when planning agricultural development on the Fagaga series.
