Space-based measurements of air quality during the World Expo 2010 in ShanghaiDuring the World Exposition 2010 (Expo, from May to October), emission control measures were implemented in Shanghai and surrounding areas to improve the air quality. To evaluate the effect of these measures, we use the tropospheric NO2 column, aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and CO concentration observations from the satellite instruments GOME-2, MODIS and MOPITT, respectively. The analysis shows about 8% and 14% reductions of tropospheric NO2 columns and AOT respectively over Shanghai during the Expo period, compared to the past three years. A 12% reduction of CO concentration at 700 hPa over Shanghai and surrounding areas is found during the Expo period. On the other hand, the satellite measurements show increases of NO2 by 20% and AOT by 23% over Shanghai urban areas after the Expo (November 2010â€“April 2011), when the short-term emission control measures were lifted. Our study indicates that the air quality measures were effective in Shanghai and surrounding provinces during the Expo period.
