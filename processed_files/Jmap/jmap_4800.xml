The geometric morphometrics and condition of Pontic shad, Alosa immaculata (Pisces: Clupeidae) migrants to the Danube RiverAnadromous fish could have intraspecific groups with different life histories; identification of these is very important for management and conservation. Geometric morphometrics represents a quick and cost-effective method to identify such intraspecific groups. In this study, geometric morphometrics of Pontic shad (Alosa immaculata) migrants from the Danube River were investigated, as was Fulton's condition factor (K), hepatosomatic index (HSI) and gonadosomatic index (GSI). Pontic shad specimens were collected during April and May of 2004 and 2006. The sample comprised four groups (65 males and 56 females in 2004; 110 males and 78 females in 2006). Geometric morphometrics revealed differences in shape that were statistically significant for both year (nested analysis of variance: F = 13.84; p < 0.001) and sex (nested analysis of variance: sex nested in year, F = 1.71; p < 0.01). The major differences between years were in head shape and position of fins. The most significant difference between females and males was in the dorsolateral expansion of the mid-body section with emphasis on the higher dorsal part of the body. Values for K in this work (0.65â€“0.70) were the lowest recorded for Pontic shad in the Danube River. Additional investigations involving both geometric morphometrics and molecular genetics are necessary to confirm the presence of races. This could be important information for conservation purposes as Pontic shad is listed as Vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature list.
