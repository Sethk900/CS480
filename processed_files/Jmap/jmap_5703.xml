Comparative morphology of the otolith of the triplefins (family: Tripterygiidae)Otolith morphology may provide useful information about the triplefin fish family Tripterygiidae. A comparative study of the otolith of 40 tripterygiid species was conducted to identify the most appropriate taxonomical characters that can separate the species and genera of the family Tripterygiidae. Among other otolith characters, it is possible to distinguish characters that clearly define a taxonomic group (genus or species), and other characters that are shared by several genera, but may be only useful to define certain species within a genus. Ontogenetic changes in the otolith of the triplefin fishes studied are evident. The otolith of the juvenile Ucla xenogrammus was the most similar to the adult otolith, while otolith of the juvenile Blennodon dorsale was the least similar to the adult otolith.
