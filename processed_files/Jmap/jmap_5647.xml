Revision of Flabelliderma Hartman, 1969 (Polychaeta: Flabelligeridae)The flabelligerid genus Flabelliderma Hartman, 1969 is redefined and its type species is reâ€established. In comparison with Flabelligera Sars, 1829, the diagnostic features include the fusion of papillae forming tubercles, often adhering sediment particles, and notopodial lobes forming large ovoid lobes. Four species are described and presented as new combinations, and three others were previously undescribed; thus the species included are F. papillosa (Essenberg, 1922) from southern California, F. berkeleyorum n. sp. from Washington, F. claparedei (de Saintâ€Joseph, 1898) from the Bay of Biscay, F. gourdoni (Gravier, 1906) from Antarctica, F. lighti n. sp. from Guadalupe Island, western Mexico, F. ockeri n. sp. from southern California, and F. pruvoti (Fauvel, 1930) from New Caledonia.
