Microhabitat choice and differential use by anurans in forest streams in southeastern BrazilThe use of space by anuran amphibians during reproductive activities was studied at eight forest streams in the Reserva Particular do Patrim√¥nio Natural Santu√°rio do Cara√ßa, southeastern Brazil. Identified microhabitats were classified into 18 types based on substrate and height above ground/water. A total of 440 individual anurans of 19 species was recorded in these microhabitat types. Electivity indices were calculated for the three most abundant species and indicated that specimens actively selected microhabitats. Species with broad niches (generalists) did not occur in more streams than species with narrow niches (specialists), and streams with higher species richness did not contain more specialists. Species showed high levels of overlap in microhabitat use, which were not related to the number of co‚Äoccurring species. The distribution patterns observed in the studied anuran assemblages likely reflect specific reproductive preferences and colonization abilities rather than the result of competitive pressures.
