Composition and distribution patterns of chewing lice of two neotropical species of TurdusWe analyzed the prevalence and intensity of chewing lice on two neotropical species of Turdus and identified morphological parameters of birds influencing louse population dynamics. The study was conducted in southernmost Rio Grande do Sul state (RS), Brazil, between July 2009 and June 2010. Chewing lice were collected by dust-ruffling. The prevalence of chewing lice on both species of Turdus was high. Chewing lice from both species of Turdus exhibit similar composition and distribution patterns. However, chewing lice were more abundant on Turdus rufiventris, whereas species richness was higher on Turdus amaurochalinus. Myrsidea and Brueelia were the most prevalent and abundant genera on both host species in all seasons of the year. A predominance of chewing louse females and adults was observed. Aggregated distributions were observed. Body length was the only morphological parameter correlated with louse abundance, suggesting that specimens with a larger body have a higher abundance of lice.
