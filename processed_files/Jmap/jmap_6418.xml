Evaluation of pheromone trapping systems in relation to light trap captures of the maize stalk borer, Busseola fusca (Fuller) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)Synthetic sex pheromone formulations of the maize stalk borer, Busseola fusca (Fuller) were compared in different trap designs with a light trap for efficiency in describing seasonal moth activity. Omni-directional traps were superior to conventional delta traps for both quantitative and qualitative estimations of moth populations. While pheromone traps tended to over-estimate moth numbers during periods of diminished moth populations, the possibility of using pheromone trapping systems to identify seasons of potentially severe infestations seems to be feasible. Descriptions of two effective omni-directional trap designs are provided.
