Physiological and biochemical responses of Scytonema javanicum (cyanobacterium) to salt stress.Scytonema javanicum (Kutz.) Born et Flah (cyanobacterium) is one of the species distributed widely in the crust of desert soils regularly subjected to severe water stress. To investigate the response of the species to salt stress, many physiological and biochemical parameters, including growth rate, ratio of variable fluorescence to maximum fluorescence (Fv/Fm), reactive oxidative species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), were determined in culture. The results showed that 50 mM NaCl inhibited growth and Fv/Fm in the medium BG-110, and that the inhibition was maximum after 1-2 days' exposure to salt stress; 50 mM NaCl also increased the contents of ROS and MDA in treated cells, which suggests that salt stress may lead to oxidative damage and lipid peroxidation in the alga. Further, changes in the antioxidative enzymes SOD and CAT in the treated alga were consistent with changes in ROS and MDA at certain extent. These observations suggest that oxidative stress resulting from salt stress in S. javanicum could result in the production of antioxidative enzymes to counteract the oxidative damage, and the enzymes may contribute to the ability of S. javanicum to survive the adverse desert environment.
