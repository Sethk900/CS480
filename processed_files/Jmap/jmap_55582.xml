In situ field-scale remediation of Cd polluted paddy soil using sepiolite and palygorskiteAt present, the remediation of heavy-metal polluted soil is a considerable problem. In this study, in situ immobilization field experiments were conducted by planting rice (Oryza sativa L.) in Cd contaminated paddy soil to determine the optimal remediation mode that would reduce the accumulation of Cd in brown grain. Sepiolite and palygorskite were utilized as amendments, while ordinary and low Cd-accumulating rice cultivars were selected as model plants. The remediation effects of the amendments on the soil and rice were investigated and the potential immobilization mechanisms were analyzed using X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The application of sepiolite and palygorskite was found to increase the pH value of the paddy soil, by varying amounts, and significantly reduce the HCl, TCLP, CaCl2, and NH4OAc-extractable Cd concentrations resulting in a notable decrease in the Cd concentration in brown rice. Both sepiolite and palygorskite were found to reduce exchangeable Cd concentrations and increase the carbonate-bound and residual fractions in paddy soil. Precipitation of Cd as carbonates or hydroxides and surface complexation were the main immobilization mechanisms for sepiolite and palygorskite. The concentration of Cd in brown rice of the low Cd-accumulating cultivar from the control plot was 0.72 mg·kg− 1. Sepiolite treatment reduced the value to 0.18 mg·kg− 1 below the maximum levels reported by Codex Stan 193-1995 and the national standard of China. It was concluded that chemical immobilization combined with crop cultivar selection could be a suitable proposal for crop safety regulation and sustainable agriculture.
