Observing the coupling effect between warm pool and Ã¢Â€Âœrain poolÃ¢Â€Â in the Pacific OceanTraditionally, the tropical zone is known as the Ã¢Â€Âœheat reservoirÃ¢Â€Â of the ocean and the Ã¢Â€ÂœfireboxÃ¢Â€Â of the atmosphere. The western equatorial Pacific has been identified as both the warmest portion of the heat reservoir, named Ã¢Â€Âœwarm poolÃ¢Â€Â (WP), and the hottest portion of the firebox where a huge amount of precipitation-induced latent-heat release is accumulated. The latter mirrors a fact that the western tropical Pacific is also the wettest area on the globe, termed Ã¢Â€Âœrain poolÃ¢Â€Â (RP), where the maximum annual precipitation is observed. The accumulation of continuous satellite data has reached a point that decade-long simultaneous observations of many important geophysical parameters have become available in recent years. One such example is the availability of a concurrent dataset of sea surface temperature, oceanic precipitation, and sea surface wind field for 1993Ã¢Â€Â“2002 derived from NOAA/AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer), TOPEX/TMR (TOPEX Microwave Radiometer), and ERS-1,2/QuikSCAT, respectively. In the present study, this dataset is used to demonstrate and investigate the coupling and covarying effects of the Pacific WP and RP, leading to a number of interesting findings on their structural similarity, locational shift, phase lag, and evolutional coherency in association with the development of and the vacillation between El NiÃƒÂ±o and La NiÃƒÂ±a events.
