RESPIRATORY RELEASE OF CARBON DIOXIDE IN ALFALFA MEDICAGO-SATIVA CULTIVAR DAWSON AND SOYBEAN UNDER FIELD CONDITIONSRespiration rates under field conditions in the above-ground portions of alfalfa and soybean crops (dark respiration) as well as root and soil respiration rates were measured at night using an open-flow system. Alfalfa was observed in 1978 and soybeans during 1979 and 1980. Full-crop respiration rates (above-ground, root and soil) of alfalfa ranged from 278 to 855 mg CO2 m-2 h-1, with an overall average of 531 mg CO2 m-2 h-1. Full-crop respiration rates of soybeans ranged from 207 to 984 mg CO2 m-2 h-1 in 1979 and 303 to 998 mg CO2 m-2 h-1 in 1980. In the period of flowering and pod sets, the overall average full-crop soybean respiration rate was 524 mg CO2 m-2 h-1 in 1979 and 627 mg CO2 m-2 h-1 in 1980. In alfalfa, soil plus roots contributed about 63% of the total CO2 release. Respiration of aerial parts was between 87 and 93% of the total plant respiration of soybeans (depending on year) with soil plus roots contributing the remainder.
