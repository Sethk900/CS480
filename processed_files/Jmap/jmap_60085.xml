Methods and Tools for Managing Losses in Water Distribution SystemsAbstractThe water industry worldwide is facing challenges of water and revenue losses. To reduce these losses and improve efficiency of water distribution systems, tools and methods have been developed over the years. This paper reviews the current tools and methodologies applied to assess, monitor, and control losses in water distribution systems. The aim is to identify the tools and methods that have been applied, knowledge gaps, and future research needs. The review findings indicate that a number of water loss management tools and methods have been developed and applied. They vary from simple managerial tools such as performance indicators to highly sophisticated optimization methods such as evolutionary algorithms. However, their application to real-world water distribution systems has been found to be generally limited. Future research opportunities exist through close collaboration of research institutions and water service providers to close the gap between theory and applications. Although not exhaustive, this review could be a valuable reference resource for practitioners and researchers dealing with water loss management in water distribution systems.
