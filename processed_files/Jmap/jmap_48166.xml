Food habits of Metachirus nudicaudatus (Didelphimorphia, Didelphidae) in a Brazilian Cerrado: diet composition and dietary seasonalityThe diet of the brown four-eyed opossum (Metachirus nudicaudatus) at a riparian savanna in Brazil was analyzed using 22 fecal samples collected monthly from November 2009 to October 2011. A comparison was established between samples from rainy and dry seasons. Diet composition varied seasonally. Arthropods and fruits were consumed in different frequencies of occurrence, in both seasons, but small vertebrates were only found in the dry season. Diet differences among biomes (Atlantic Forest and Cerrado) were also assessed by comparing the frequency of food items in the fecal sample in our study with data from the literature. Invertebrates (100%) were the most frequent food category found, followed by fruits (59%) and vertebrates (13.6%). Small differences in the consumption of invertebrates were found among the biomes. Nevertheless, seed frequency was significantly higher in samples from the Cerrado than in those from the Atlantic Forest. In our study site, Metachirus nudicaudatus is opportunistic and has an omnivorous diet, tending to include more fruits in its natural diet than has been previously described.
