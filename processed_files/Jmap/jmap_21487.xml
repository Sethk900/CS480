Female genitalia of Seasogonia Young from China, with a new synonym and a new record (Hemiptera, Cicadellidae, Cicadellini)Abstract Seasogonia Young, 1986 is a sharpshooter genus with 13 species, four of them recorded from China. In this paper, Seasogonia sandaracata (Distant, 1908) is recorded as new for China and Seasogonia rufipenna Li & Wang, 1992 is regarded as a junior synonym of Seasogonia nigromaculata Kuoh, 1991. The morphological diversity of the female genitalia of Seasogonia is still poorly known. We provide herein detailed descriptions and illustrations of three Chinese Seasogonia species. Notes on the female genitalia of Seasogonia, including intraspecific and interspecific variation, and comparisons between the female genitalia of Seasogonia and of other related genera from China are provided. The preliminary results indicate that the female genitalia may provide useful features for the taxonomy of Seasogonia and other members of the Old World Cicadellini.
