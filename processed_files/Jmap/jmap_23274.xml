Description of Oculogryphus shuensis sp. n. (Coleoptera, Lampyridae), the first species of the genus in the Sino-Japanese realm, with a modified key to the subfamily OtotretinaeAbstract A new species of the lampyrid genus Oculogryphus Jeng, Engel, and Yang, O. shuensis sp. n. from China (Sichuan Province) is described and figured. The genus previously was known only from Vietnam, and the new species is the first representative of the genus in the Sino-Japanese zoogeographic realm. Some morphological variations of Oculogryphus and the allied genus Stenocladius are discussed and a modification to the most recent key to ototretine genera is proposed to accommodate Oculogryphus.
