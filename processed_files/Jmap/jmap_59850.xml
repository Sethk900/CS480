Reducing the Effect of Inaccurate Lane Identification on PP69-10-Based Rut CharacterizationAbstractThe new draft AASHTO standard practice PP70-10 and PP69-10 are promising to change the landscape of rut measurement. PP70-10 specifies the technical requirements for transverse profiling and PP69-10 defines multiple parameters such as percent deformation and rut cross-sectional area to characterize a rut. Per PP70-10, an inspection device should cover at least 4.0 m (13 ft) transverse width in order to cover the full lane under vehicle wandering. However, for many existing transverse profilers, it is challenging to identify the lane markings from the raw images in a consistent manner. This deficiency would prevent these systems from accurately calculating PP69-10-based rut attributes. In this study, with the field data collected in Arkansas national highway systems (NHS) using an automated system called PaveVision3D Ultra, the impact of lane offsets on PP69-10-based rut attributes is investigated. The rut attributes calculated with programs embedded in the system, where accurate lane locations are semiautomated extracted from both 2D and 3D images, are set up as base values. It is found that lane offsets greater than 50 mm would cause significant errors in rut measurement. To reduce the negative effect of inaccurate lane identification on rut characterization, a methodical framework is proposed in this research. A case study is performed to demonstrate that machine learning approaches could satisfactorily aid in increasing the accuracy of rut characterization even when the locations of actual lane markings are unknown. This research would improve the reliability and accuracy of the new AASHTO rut measurement.
