THE OASIS EFFECT: RESPONSE OF BIRDS TO EXURBAN DEVELOPMENT IN A SOUTHWESTERN SAVANNARanches are being converted to exurban housing developments in the southwestern United States, with potentially significant but little-studied impacts on biological diversity. We counted birds in grasslands and savannas in southeastern Arizona that were grazed by livestock, embedded in low-density exurban housing developments, or both, or neither. Species richness and bird abundance were higher in exurban neighborhoods than in undeveloped landscapes, independent of livestock grazing. The positive response to development was particularly evident among doves, quail, hummingbirds, aerial insectivores, and some but not all ground-foraging sparrows. Effects of livestock grazing were comparatively minor and mostly involved birds with requirements for tall ground cover or the lack of it. The average rank correlation between counts of individual species and housing density was positive across all transects. However, this relationship disappeared among the exurban transects alone, and bird species richness on the exurban transects was negatively correlated with the number of homes nearby. These results suggest that the positive influence of exurban development on avian abundance and variety was greatest at the lowest housing densities. We attribute the attraction of many birds to exurban development to an oasis effect, in which resources otherwise scarce in arid southwestern environments (shade, nectar, nest sites, and especially water) are relatively abundant around exurban home sites. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that exurban home sites represented resource supply points inside birds' home ranges otherwise consisting mostly of natural vegetation.
