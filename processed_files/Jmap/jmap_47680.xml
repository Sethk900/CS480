Amphipod diversity at three Tunisian lagoon complexes in relation to environmental conditionsThe amphipod communities of different wetland types belonging to three coastal lagoons complexes in northern Tunisia, Ichkeul (37°06′ to 37°14′ N, 09°35′ to 09°56′ E), Ghar El Melh (37°06′ to 37°10′ N, 10°08′ to 10°14′ E) and Korba (36°34′ to 36°38′ N, 10°52′ to 10°54′ E), were studied with respect to species composition and abundance and their relationship with abiotic environmental characteristics, namely air and soil temperature and humidity, soil grain size and the soil content of organic matter and heavy metals. Both highest abundance and highest diversity of amphipods were observed in the lagoon complex of Ichkeul, which is characterized by higher contents of organic matter but also by higher heavy metal concentrations in the soil than the lagoon complexes of Ghar El Melh and Korba. Although amphipod abundance does not seem to linearly depend on environmental parameters, unimodal Canonical Correspondence Analysis suggests that amphipod abundance is related to grain size of the soil, to the soil content of organic matter and to several heavy metals.
