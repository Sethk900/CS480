Presence of rhizoids in two species of the genus Bowerbankia (Bryozoa: Ctenostomata) and their systematic relevanceThe existence is reported of rhizoids in specimens of Bowerbankia pustulosa and Bowerbankia citrina collected from different Iberian locations. The structure of these rhizoids differs from that of other fixation structures previously reported in Bowerbankia and redescribed here. Rhizoids in both species are probably homologous with those of Amathia, supporting the close relationship between these two genera.
