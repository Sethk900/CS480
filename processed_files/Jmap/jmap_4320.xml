Calling Behavior and Morphology of the Stridulatory Apparatus in Neotropical Grasshoppers (Aleuas Stål; Orthoptera)The sound production and sound producing apparatus of two species of grasshoppers, A. lineatus Stål, 1878 and A. vitticollis Stål, 1878 (Orthoptera, Acrididae, Copiocerinae) have been studied. For both species oscillograms and other physical data on sounds are presented for the first time. The sound producing behavior is described and the stridulation apparatus mechanism is illustrated. In the case of A. vitticollis these data are the first known on its sound production and general acoustic behavior.
