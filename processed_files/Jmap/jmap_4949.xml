Morphological reply to a DNA call: a new cryptic species of Hydraena from western Europe, with a complete overview of the Hydraena gracilis complex (Coleoptera: Hydraenidae: â€œHaenydraâ€ lineage)Recent molecular analyses revealed unexpected genetic variability within Hydraena gracilis, one of the most common and widespread European moss beetles, belonging to the West Palaearctic endemic â€œHaenydraâ€ lineage. For this taxon, molecular data univocally evidenced two distinct clades, the first one including populations from the Iberian Peninsula, and the second including populations from central and eastern Europe. Aedeagal morphology of H. gracilis was further investigated, finally demonstrating the actual existence of a new cryptic species of the H. gracilis complex in Portugal, Spain and the French Pyrenees. The geographical range of the true H. gracilis was consequently revised. Finally, dichotomous keys for males of all species belonging to the H. gracilis complex, and for males of all the Iberian â€œHaenydraâ€ species, are also supplied.
