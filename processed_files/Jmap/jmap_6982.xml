Cordylancistrus perijae, a New Species of Armored Catfish (Siluroidei: Loricariidae) from the Maracaibo Basin, Venezuelanew species of loricariid catfish, Cordylancistrus perijae, is described on the basis of 32 specimens collected in three rivers N of Sierra de Perij , in NW Zulia state, Maracaibo Basin, Venezuela. The genus Cordylancistrus was created by Isbrücker (1980) for the single known species, Cordylancistrus torbesensis (Schultz 1944). All specimens of this species were collected in the Torbes River, a tributary of the Uribante River, Apure River system, Orinoco Basin. Cordylancistrus perijae can be recognized from C. torbesensis by the combination of the following characters: Head and caudal peduncle less depressed; odontodes of the interopercular area short, the longest not reaching beyond the base of the pectoral fin; and a distinctive colour pattern. Cordylancistrus torbesensis and C. perijae are restricted to the foothill rivers of the Cordillera de Mérida and Sierra de Perijá, respectively. These rivers belong to different basins (Orinoco and Maracaibo) clearly separated by the Cordillera de Mérida. This geographical distribution adds a new element to the biogeographical discussion about the Venezuelan fauna and lets us suggest a minimum age for the genus Cordylancistrus in Venezuela of approximately 20 my (Early Miocene).
