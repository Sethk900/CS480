Taxonomy, natural history and zoogeography of sand beach isopods from the coast of Southern ChileAbstract Seven species of marine isopods were collected on sandy beaches of Southern Chile (from about 37° S until 42° S). From these, Excirolana hirsuticauda Menzies, Excirolana monodi Carvacho, Chaetilia paucidens Menzies, Macrochiridothea setifer Menzies and M. mehuinensis Jaramillo are known only from the Chilean coasts. Another species, Excirolana braziliensis Richardson, is known from other areas of American coasts. One species is identified here as Macrochiridothea aff. lilianae by its resemblance with M. lilianae Moreira from Southern Brazil. All these species are here briefly described and some aspects of their ecology added. Also Zoogeographic characterization of the studied area is discussed in relation to the distributional patterns of isopods living in them.
