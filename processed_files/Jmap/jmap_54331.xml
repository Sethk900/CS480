Mineralogy of soils from basaltic ash, Taveuni, FijiThe mineralogy of six soil profiles derived from basaltic ash in Taveuni, Fiji has been investigated. Three stages of weathering are identified. Weakly weathered soils contain significant amounts of Ca-feldspar in sand fractions, and the clay fractions are dominated by short-range order allophanic materials. Moderately weathered soils contain subordinate Ca-feldspar in sand fractions, and moderate to subordinate short-range order allophanic materials in clay fractions. Strongly weathered soils contain very little Ca-feldspar, and the clay fractions are dominated by gibbsite and 1:1 clay minerals. We concluded that short-range order allophanic materials are intermediate weathering products, and that there is a poor or no relationship between precipitation and the amounts of 1:1 minerals and allophanic materials.
