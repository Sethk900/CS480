Revision of the Tribe Calopterini (Coleoptera, Lycidae)The genus group taxa of the tribe Calopterini are revised. The genus Callanganum Pic, 1922 is proposed as a junior synonym of Ceratopriomorphus Pic, 1922, the genus Pseudolinoptes Pic, 1922 as a junior synonym of Emplectus Erichson, 1847. The genera Broxylus Waterhouse, 1879 and Ceratoprion Gorham, 1884 are transferred to the subfamilies Metriorrhynchinae and Leptolycinae, respectively. Calopteron pennatum Bourgeois, 1879 is transferred to Leptoceletes Green, 1952. Calopteron limbatum (Fabricius, 1801) is transferred to Metapteron Bourgeois, 1905, and Calopteron scutellare Kirsch, 1865 is transferred to Caenia. The subgenera Falsocaenia Pic, 1922, and Lycomorphon Pic, 1922 are raised to generic status. Validity of Lycinella parvula Gorham, 1884 is reinstated. Neotypes of Lycus (Calopteron) apicale Guérin-Méneville, 1838 and Lycus suturalis Latreille, 1833 as well as a lectotype of Idiopteron biplagiatum (Kirsch, 1884) are designated. Celetes basalis LeConte, 1847 is fixed as a type species of Celetes Newman, 1838. Illustrations of important diagnostic characters and key to Calopterini genera are given.
