The relation between accessibility, diversity and indigenous valuation of vegetation in the Bolivian Andes.A quantitative ethnobotanical study was conducted in the semi-arid Bolivian Andes community of Apillapampa to evaluate the impact of site accessibility on the diversity and perceived usefulness of (sub-)woody plants. Vegetation was sampled in thirty-six transects of 50 * 2 m2, whereas data on plant uses were obtained from 13 local Quechua participants. Accessibility of sample sites correlated negatively with plant diversity, but positively with perceived usefulness. Hence, in spite of being less diverse, vegetation of more accessible sites was perceived as more useful to people than vegetation of more remote and also more diverse sites. This result contributes to the validity of the widely accepted notion that "more accessible plant resources are more useful to people", not only at the level of individual plant species, but also for entire vegetation communities. In this respect, our finding that people attribute an equal usefulness to the vegetation of two local ecological zones (i.e. prepuna and puna) most likely reflects their similar accessibility from the village centre, which is located on the edge between both zones.
