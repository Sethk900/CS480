Prediction of Rainfall-Runoff in an Ungauged Basin: Case Study in the Mountainous Region of Northern ThailandAbstractReduction of uncertainty in hydrologic predictions is important for water resources development and management, especially in ungauged basins. The objective of this study was to predict rainfall and runoff in an ungauged basin located in a mountainous region of northern Thailand by using a weather radar to estimate rainfall and a modeling approach to simulate rainfall-runoff processes. The calibrated Ze-R relationship (Ze=18R1.45) was used to estimate rainfall over a gauged basin and an assumed ungauged basin. The runoff simulations in the gauged and ungauged basins were conducted using the quasi-distributed hydrological model HEC-HMS. The simulation results in the gauged basin, for both calibration and verification, were in agreement with the observed data. Model parameters in the assumed ungauged basin were estimated using transposition and regionalization techniques. The predicted direct runoff hydrograph in the assumed ungauged basin using radar measured rainfall and the regionalization technique matches well with the measurements at the basin outlet. Based on the study results, the radar rainfall estimates and regionalization of the hydrologic model parameters are promising alternatives for improved hydrologic predictions in ungauged basins.
