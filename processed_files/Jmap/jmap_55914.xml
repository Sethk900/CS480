Adsorption and desorption of carbendazim and cadmium in typical soils in northeastern China as affected by temperatureThe adsorption and desorption of carbendazim and cadmium (Cd) in soils (burozem and phaeozem) typically distributed in northeastern China were investigated at two different temperatures, 25 and 40 °C. The effects of interaction between carbendazim and Cd on their adsorption and desorption were also discussed. The results showed that the adsorption of carbendazim was exothermic with ΔHΘ values of − 5.3 kJ/mol for burozem and − 33.6 kJ/mol for phaeozem, while the adsorption of Cd was endothermic with ΔHΘ values of 43.2 and 37.4 kJ/mol, respectively. Increasing the temperature from 25 °C to 40 °C could promote the desorption hysteresis of carbendazim, but decreased the desorption hysteresis of Cd. The coexistence of carbendazim and Cd promoted the adsorption of carbendazim but suppressed the adsorption of Cd and the effect was amplified as the temperature increased to 40 °C. The adsorption amount of carbendazim at 25 °C increased 11% for burozem and 4% for phaeozem respectively when the concentration of Cd was 50 mg/L. This increased to 56% and 20% respectively when the temperature was increased to 40 °C. When the concentration of carbendazim was 30 mg/L, the amount of Cd adsorption decreased 13% for burozem and 5% for phaeozem at 25 °C, and 33% and 14% at 40 °C, respectively.
