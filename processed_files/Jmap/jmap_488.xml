The Role of Light and Soil Moisture in Plant Community Resistance to Invasion by Yellow Starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis).To resist establishment by an invasive plant, a community may require one or more species functionally similar to the invader in their resource acquisition pattern. In this study, communities consisting of native winter annual forbs, non-native annual grasses, native perennials, or a combination of the two native communities were established with and without <em>Centaurea solstitialis</em> to determine the effect of soil moisture and light availability on plant community invasion resistance. The annual plant communities were unable to resist invasion by <em>C. solstitialis</em>. In the native winter annual forb community, senescence in late spring increased light penetration (>75%) to the soil surface, allowing seeded <em>C. solstitialis</em> to quickly establish and dominate the plots. In addition, native annual forbs utilized only shallow soil moisture, whereas <em>C. solstitialis</em> used shallow and deep soil moisture. In communities containing native perennials, only <em>Elymus glaucus</em> established well and eventually dominated the plots. During the first 2 years of establishment, water use pattern of perennial communities was similar to native annual forbs and resistance to invasion was associated with reduced light availability during the critical stages of <em>C. solstitialis</em> establishment. In later years, however, water use pattern of perennial grass communities was similar or greater than <em>C. solstitialis</em>-dominated plots. These results show that Central Valley grasslands that include <em>E. glaucus</em> resist <em>C. solstitialis</em> invasion by a combination of light suppression and soil water competition. Spatiotemporal resource utilization patterns, and not just functional similarity, should be considered when developing restoration strategies to resist invasion by many non-native species.
