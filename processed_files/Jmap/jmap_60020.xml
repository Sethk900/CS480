Planning-Level Capital Cost Estimates for PumpingAbstractIn planning and optimization studies, engineers are often asked to provide cost estimates for facilities without have knowledge of details of the design. This paper presents a summary of published cost equations for water and wastewater pumping stations with some recommendations for application. In general, because of economies of scale, these cost equations are not linear.
