Effects of Tissue Collection Methods on Morphometrics and Survival of Captive Neonatal Northern BobwhiteWe assessed effects of tissue collection methods (i.e., patagial microbiopsy and down feathers) and chick age at sampling on morphometrics and 21-day survival of 600 captive neonatal northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). We observed minimal effects on morphometrics and no difference in survival among patagial microbiopsy (x̄ = 0.96 ± 0.03), down feathers (x̄ = 0.92 ± 0.04), and control (x̄ = 0.86 ± 0.05) methods. DNA analysis from patagial microbiopsy, down feather, and egg tooth samples showed greater concentrations of DNA from patagial microbiopsy (x̄ = 10.28 ± 1.74 μg/ml) than either down feather (x̄ = 4.10 ± 1.74 μg/ml) or egg teeth (x̄ = 2.35 ± 1.74 μg/ml).
