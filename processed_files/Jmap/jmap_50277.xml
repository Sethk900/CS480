A new species of Harpacticella Sars, 1908 (Copepoda, Harpacticoida), from a tidal pool on Jeju Island, KoreaAbstract A new species of the genus Harpacticella Sars, 1908 is described from a tidal pool on Jeju Island, Korea. Harpacticella jejuensis sp. n. is closely related to Harpacticella itoi Chang & Kim, 1991, with regard to the structure of P1 exp-1 and enp-1, the length of P1 exp-1 and exp-2, and the setal number of the P5 exopod in males. However, the new species is clearly distinguishable from Harpacticella itoi by the combined following characters: six setae on the P5 exopod in females, one naked seta on the inner margin of P1 exp-2, the short endopod of P1 compared to the exopod, and a naked long seta on the proximal inner margin of the P5 exopod of males. The mtCOI partial sequence is provided as a DNA barcode for the new species.
