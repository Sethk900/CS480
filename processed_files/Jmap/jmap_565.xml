Olycella aff. junctolineella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) florivory on Opuntia microdasys, a Chihuahuan Desert endemic cactus.The object of this study was to provide the first data on the natural history of the little known plant-florivore interaction between Opuntia microdasys and Olycella aff. junctolineella larvae and to study interindividual variability in the number of reproductive structures attacked as a function of plant resource availability.
