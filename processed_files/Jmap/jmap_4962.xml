Known status of the endangered western Palaearctic violet click beetle (Limoniscus violaceus) (Coleoptera)The monitoring of many threatened saproxylic species is still challenging. As a result, knowledge of their ecology and distribution is often patchy, even for species that are crucial for environmental policies, such as Natura 2000 species. Here we compiled 436 data entries on the occurrence of one of these species, the Western Palaearctic violet click beetle Limoniscus violaceus. The beetle is currently listed in 58 Sites of Community Importance (SCI) of the Natura 2000 network, covering an area of 3859 km2. We conclude that 15 of these SCIs have no proven evidence of the presence of L. violaceus. However, the species has been recorded in 16 new SCIs. The beetle was associated with basal hollow trees in 187 localities from 17 countries. We also provide an overview of the current knowledge about the species and comment on its distribution in each country.
