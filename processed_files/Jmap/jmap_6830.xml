Rodent Diversity and Land Use in Montebello, Chiapas, MexicoWe analyzed the abundance and diversity of Heteromyid and Murid rodents in the Lagos de Montebello National Park and adjacent areas, Chiapas, Mexico. We sampled three habitat types with different degrees of disturbance: pine-oak-liquidambar forest, ecotone and crop farming lands. Habitat types were defined considering characteristics such as heterogeneity, structural complexity and arboreal cover. We obtained ancillary habitat data considered important for small mammal requirements. Data on rodent communities were obtained by capture-mark-recapture between February and October 1996. We made 410 captures in 3820 trap-nights effort. Ten species were recorded, including one endemic with restricted distribution in Chiapas. Mouse diversity in the forest was significantly higher than within the farm lands. A Kendall correlation analysis showed positive relationship between rodent community species richness and habitat heterogeneity. Diversity of rodents was associated with the habitat complexity and structural elements, and negatively correlated with farming intensity. We found a high beta diversity and low similarity of the rodent communities in the three different habitats. Community composition strongly changed from the forest through the ecotone into the farm lands, with five species gained and seven species lost. The highest species richness was found in the ecotone; however, it showed a strong dominance of a single species that can convert into a plague of crops, and relatively low abundance of the other species. The pine-oak-liquidambar forest had the highest diversity indices, sheltering a particular rodent community within the study area, it therefore probably has the most important role in the conservation of the local biodiversity.
