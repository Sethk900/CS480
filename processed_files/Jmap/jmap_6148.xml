Chlorsulfuron and tribenuron antagonize tralkoxydim activityHerbicide mixtures are used to increase efficacy on broad-leaved as well as grass weeds and/or to reduce input costs. Components of mixtures may, however, induce antagonism. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of tralkoxydim (2-(1[etoxyimino)propyl]-3-hydroxy-5-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) cyclohex-2-enome) in combination with chlorsulfuron (2-chloro-N-[[(4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazine2yl)amino]carbonyl]benzenes ulfonamide and tribenuron 2-[[[[(4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazine-2-yl)methylamino] carbonyl] amino]sulfonyl]benzoic acid on oats (Avena sativa L.) when applied as a tank mixture at different rates in a glasshouse. Significant differences were found between treatments, which indicated that antagonism occurs with the application of the above mentioned herbicides when applied as a tank mixture. Tralkoxydim at the registered rate (218 g a.i. ha-1) gave very good control on oats, which were not affected when chlorsulfuron (13.3 gai. ha-1) was added. Tribenuron on the other hand surely antagonized the tralkoxydim efficacy on oats and this negative response could not be alleviated with the addition of ammoniumsulphate.
