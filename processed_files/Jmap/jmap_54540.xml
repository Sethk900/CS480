Calcium and magnesium transport in aggregated soils at variable ionic strengthMiscible displacement experiments were performed under conditions of variable total concentration and saturated steady-state water flow in order to study the transport of CaCl2 and MgCl2 with simultaneous cation exchange through aggregates (diameter: 0.2–0.4 cm) of two soils (Abist loam and Laegern clay loam). Using independently measured parameter values, good predictions of the experimental CaMg breakthrough curves (BTC) were obtained with a transport model based on the classical convection-dispersion equation and on the assumption of local ion exchange equilibrium. The agreement between experimental and model curves was best in the early parts of the BTC. Some tailing was observed in the later parts which was not successfully accounted for by the model. Calculations with an extended model, based on the mobile-immobile water (or two-region) concept, showed that the tailing effect may be partially due to physical non-equilibrium conditions governing the solute transfer between inter- and intra-aggregate solution. In a previous sensitivity analysis, predictions with the two-region model showed great sensitivity to the choice of parameter values determining mass transfer and partitioning of the total cation exchange capacity between mobile and immobile region. Unfortunately, however, no satisfactory methods were found to be available to determine these parameters independently. Estimation of the mass transfer coefficient from BTC of non-reactive tracers (3H2O and 3Cl) failed, because the latter were in perfect agreement with the local equilibrium assumption. In addition to physical non-equilibrium effect, the results suggest that cation exchange capacities during transport were significantly underestimated with the standard NH4OAc method.
