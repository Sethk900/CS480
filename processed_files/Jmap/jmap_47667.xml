Why are there so few â€œfar southernâ€ myriapods?There are no extant Antarctic myriapods. The â€œfar southernâ€ islands south of latitude 45Â°Â S together with the isolated (south Atlantic) Tristan da Cunha, Gough, (south Indian) St Paul, Amsterdam and (south Pacific) Chatham islands (at 37 to 44Â°Â S), harbour only 33 native, introduced and partly identified taxa, including 17 Chilopoda, 11 Diplopoda, two Pauropoda and four Symphyla. The myriapods confined to the extreme edge of the Southern Ocean are entirely derived from pre-glacial Tertiary relicts or post-glacial anthropogenic introductions and show no evidence of co-occurring sibling taxa. This unusual distribution pattern provides a useful â€œno dispersal/no speciationâ€ benchmark that can be applied to other far-southern non-marine invertebrates where the distinction between pre-glacial and post-glacial endemic taxa is not so clearly defined.
