Phenetic and Phylogenetic relationships of the Chilean Alsodes and Telmatobius (Amphibia, Leptodactylidae) and proposal of a new genusTo understand the taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships of Alsodes montanus and A. pehuenche the species were compared with species of the genera Alsodes and Telmatobius. Comparisons were based on internal and external, qualitative and quantitative characters. Information was analysed phenetically and phylogenetically. Phenetic analysis reveals for A. montanus and A. pehuenche an independent position with respect to other Alsodes and intermediate between species of Abodes and Telmatobius. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that A. montanus and A. pehuenche have more ancestral states of characters than the species of Abodes and Telmatobius analysed. A new genus, containing A. montanus and A. pehuenche is proposed.
