Estimates of sea surface nitrate concentrations from sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentration in upwelling areas: A case study for the Benguela systemThe knowledge of nitrate fields at global or regional scales in the ocean is fundamental for the study of oceanic biogeochemical processes, particularly those linked to new primary production. The estimate of nitrate concentrations from space is generally based on empirical inverse relationships between sea surface temperature (SST) and nitrate concentrations. These relationships, however, are often highly variable spatially and temporally, and hardly applicable to large areas (i.e., larger than a few degrees in latitude). In this paper we propose a new approach specifically developed for areas influenced by upwelling processes. It relates the nitrate concentration to the difference between SST and the estimated temperature of the upwelled water (variable with latitude and season), Î´T, which is an indicator of the time elapsed since upwelling. This approach is tested for the Benguela upwelling system, and algorithms are developed using in situ data provided by the World Ocean Database 2005 of the NOAA-NESDIS-National Oceanographic Data Center. The results reveal a significant improvement compared to the NO3âSST relationships, and a single algorithm can be applied to the whole upwelling area (15 to 35Â°S). Further improvement is gained by coupling this approach with a method that derives sea surface nitrate concentrations from SST and surface chlorophyll a concentration using multiple regression analyses, as proposed by Goes et al.
