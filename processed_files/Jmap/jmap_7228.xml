Ecolog√≠a alimentaria de batar√° grande taraba major (aves: Formicariidae) en el valle aluvial del r√≠o paran√° medio, ArgentinaThe diet of the Great Antshrike Taraba major was investigated using 40 specimens collected on the Carabajal island, Parana river, in the province of Santa Fe, Argentine, from 1984 to 1986. The stomach content was composed of seeds, crustaceans, insects, arachnids, molluscs and small mammals. A seasonal change was found between summer‚Äautumn and winter‚Äspring. The animal part was more pronounced during winter, but ants of the genus A cromyrmex were present throughout the year. In summer and autumn the seeds taken then contributed to an omnivorous type of diet. High quality habitat for the Great Antshrike consists of tracts of riverine forests rich in creepers and vines (enriedales), where there are food, protection, breeding and sleeping places.
