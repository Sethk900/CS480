Taxonomy and phylogeny of the genus Liotesba Scheerpeltz (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae: Staphylininae: Xantholinini) with descriptions of four new speciesThe taxonomy and phylogeny of the genus Liotesba Scheerpeltz, 1965 (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae: Staphylininae: Xantholinini) are studied. Four new species are described: Liotesba fengyangshana sp. nov. from Zhejiang, Liotesba recticeps sp. nov. from Sichuan, Liotesba expansipalpis sp. nov. from Hubei and Liotesba ovaticeps sp. nov. from Sichuan. Six known species are also redescribed in detail due to insufficient original description and lack of modern data. The genus Liotesba is therefore increased by four species to 17 species. A key to species and a distribution map for all known species are provided. Phylogenetic analysis is conducted for 12 terminal taxa (10 Liotesba species and two other Xantholinini species as outgroups) based on 58 characters and results in two most parsimonious trees (consistency index = 0.47, retention index = 0.40, L = 154). By mapping the morphology of labrum and aedeagus of 10 species onto the phylogenetic trees, perspective evolutionary trends of the two characters are exhibited: the aedeagus possessing the spinulate inner sac may be primitive, and the labrum with protruding median teeth may have evolved more than once within the genus Liotesba. http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:8706FA00-904F-4993-961D-0E001557AB86
