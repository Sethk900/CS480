Restoration of Native Perennials in a California Annual Grassland after Prescribed Spring Burning and Solarization.Grasslands dominated by exotic annual grasses have replaced native perennial vegetation types in vast areas of California. Prescribed spring fires can cause a temporary replacement of exotic annual grasses by native and non-native forbs, but generally do not lead to recovery of native perennials, especially where these have been entirely displaced for many years. Successful reintroduction of perennial species after fire depends on establishment in the postfire environment. We studied the effects of vegetation changes after an April fire on competition for soil moisture, a key factor in exotic annual grass dominance. As an alternative to fire, solarization effectively kills seeds of most plant species but with a high labor investment per area. We compared the burn to solarization in a study of establishment and growth of seeds and transplants of the native perennial grass Purple needlegrass (<em>Nassella pulchra</em>) and coastal sage species California sagebrush (<em>Artemisia californica</em>). After the fire, initial seed bank and seedling densities and regular percent cover and soil moisture (0-20 cm) data were collected in burned and unburned areas. Burned areas had 96% fewer viable seeds of the dominant annual grass, Ripgut brome (<em>Bromus diandrus</em>), leading to replacement by forbs from the seed bank, especially non-native Black mustard (<em>Brassica nigra</em>). In the early growing season, <em>B. diandrus</em> dominating unburned areas consistently depleted soil moisture to a greater extent between rains than forbs in burned areas. However, <em>B. diandrus</em> senesced early, leaving more moisture available in unburned areas after late-season rains. <em>Nassella pulchra</em> and <em>A. californica</em> established better on plots treated with fire and/or solarization than on untreated plots. We conclude that both spring burns and solarization can produce conditions where native perennials can establish in annual grasslands. However, the relative contribution of these treatments to restoration appears to depend on the native species being reintroduced, and the long-term success of these initial restoration experiments remains to be determined.
