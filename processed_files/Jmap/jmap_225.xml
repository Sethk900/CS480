Constraints on Sedge Meadow Self-Restoration in Urban Wetlands.Invasive plants and urban run-off constrain efforts to restore sedge meadow wetlands. We asked if native graminoids can self-restore following the removal of <em>Typha &times; glauca</em> (hybrid cattail), and if not, what limits their recovery? After we harvested <em>Typha</em> and depleted its rhizome starch reserves, <em>Carex</em> spp. expanded vegetatively (approximately 1 m over 2 years) but not by recruiting seedlings. A seedling emergence experiment showed that seed banks were depleted where <em>Typha</em> had eliminated the sedge meadow over a decade ago (based on aerial photo analysis). <em>Carex</em> seedling emergence was 75-90% lower where <em>Carex</em> was absent than where it remained in the plant community, and at least 17 species that were abundant 30 years ago were absent from the seed bank and extant vegetation. By varying hydroperiod, we showed that prolonged flooding prevented emergence of <em>Carex</em> seedlings and that a fluctuating hydroperiod reduced emergence and ultimately killed all <em>Carex</em> seedlings. In contrast, <em>Typha</em> seedlings emerged and survived regardless of hydroperiod. Thus, slow vegetative expansion by <em>Carex</em>, depauperate seed banks, and altered hydroperiods all constrain self-restoration. To compensate for multiple constraints on self-restoration, we recommend a long-term management approach that capitalizes on flooding and the capacity of <em>Carex</em> spp. to regrow vegetatively. We suggest annually harvesting swaths of <em>Typha</em> at the edges of clones, before or during flood events, to allow gradual, vegetative self-restoration of <em>Carex</em> spp.
