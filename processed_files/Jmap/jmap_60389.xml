Spaceâtime variations of the TOPEX/POSEIDON-derived heat storage anomaly over the Kuroshio upstream regionsI processed 9.6 years of TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P) altimeter data and computed the time series of heat storage (HS) anomaly over the Kuroshio upstream regions. Coherence between the heat storage anomaly and the wind stress curl is significant (>0.8) at the annual component over the studied area. Using wavelet analysis, the semiannual component has significantly westward propagating signals at 19 and 27Â°N. The annual component is significantly strong at 11 and 27Â°N while westward-propagating signals can be found at the North Equatorial Current regions. The peaks of the annual components of heat storage anomalies occur in summer and the peaks of the annual components of wind stress curl exit in winter. However, generally, the wind stress curl lows are 1 month ahead of the peaks of heat storage anomalies at 1-year component.
