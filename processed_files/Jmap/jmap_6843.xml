Vocalization as a Response to Capture in the Central Chilean Lizard Liolaemus chiliensis (Tropiduridae)Among 11 Liolaemus lizard species examined in central and south-central Chile only L. chiliensis responded to capture and handling by vocalizing. Vocalizations sounded more like a squeak than a hiss, and volume was sufficient to be heard at a distance of ~3 m. The vocalization is probably produced by the larynx and may be an antipredator response. Similarities of L. chiliensis to the anguid lizard Elgaria multicarinata in California are discussed.
