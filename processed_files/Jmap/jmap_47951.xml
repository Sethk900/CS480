Notes on Scolytus fagi Walsh 1867 with the ignation of a neotype, distribution notes and Key to Scolytus Geoffroy of America east the Mississippi River (Coleoptera, Curculionidae, Scolytinae, Scolytini)Abstract The identification of Scolytus fagi Walsh has been difficult because of the lack of diagnostic literature, the occurrence of several morphologically similar sympatric Scolytus species and the loss of the syntypes. In an effort to reduce taxonomic confusion, we designate a neotype for Scolytus fagi, redescribe the male and female, add new distributional records and create a key for the identification of eastern Scolytus species.
