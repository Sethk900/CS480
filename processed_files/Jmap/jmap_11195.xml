Bovine tuberculosis in Michigan: stakeholder attitudes and implications for eradication effortsBovine tuberculosis (TB) has been discovered in unprecedented levels in Michigan's white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) herd. Human practices have facilitated the spread of bovine TB in white-tailed deer, and public cooperation is necessary to reduce the spread of the disease. Social data can determine public support for eradication strategies, as well as identify targets and messages for ongoing communication efforts. We conducted a survey of 5 bovine TB-issue stakeholder groups to assess and compare attitudes toward bovine TB-related topics and support for eradication and eradication policies. We also identified knowledge levels and interest in future bovine TB issue communications and preferences for communication sources. Results indicated that stakeholders supported the bovine TB eradication goal, but were less supportive of specific eradication policies. Stakeholders held different beliefs about threats posed by bovine TB, and about the means through which the disease is transmitted; stakeholder groups also had different levels of bovine TB-related knowledge. A strong majority of respondents (89%) were interested in being informed about new bovine TB issue-related information.
