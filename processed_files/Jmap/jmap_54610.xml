Chemical and mineralogical changes during genesis of a Podzol from till in Southern SwedenChemical analysis comprised determinations of pH, cation exchange capacity, base saturation, titrateable acidity, Fe and Al extractable with sodium dithionite-citrate and pyrophosphate and X-ray fluorescence of bulk composition. The mineralogy of the clay fraction was also investigated. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis of mineral grains and coatings were performed on thin sections. Quantification of long-term weathering and decrease in acid neutralization capacity were based on the relative accumulation of Ti in the profile. Morphological and chemical analyses identified the soil as an Orthic Podzol affected by previous agriculture. For 100 yr the site has been forested by spruce with development of a new E horizon. Selective chemical extraction analysis and clay mineralogy indicated a solum to a depth of 0.7 m. Long-term annual losses in g/m2 since deglaciation were: Al-1.00, Fe-0.48, Ca-0.27, Mg-0.07, K-0.65, Na-0.53 and P-0.009. The annual loss of mineral soil material was 19.1 g/m2. Annual long-term decreases in acid neutralization capacity amounted to 196 meq/m2 and are ascribed mainly to the action of soil organic matter. The long-term annual loss rate was lower than the present metal fluxes monitored by lysimeter studies. This could indicate a recent increase in leaching caused, for example, by acid rain.
