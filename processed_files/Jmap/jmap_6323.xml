The optimal rooting medium for minisetts of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.)Three different rooting media, namely, river sand, sawdust and wood shavings, were used for rooting various sizes of minisetts of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), uniformly pre-treated with wood ash, indolebutyric acid (IBA), Captan and Lindane. The best substrate was found to be pure river sand, followed by wood shavings and lastly, sawdust. Four sizes of minisetts were used in the experiment, i.e. 5 g, 10 g, 20 g and 40 g. It was apparent from the results that the 10-g minisetts rooted better (P > 0.05) than the others.
