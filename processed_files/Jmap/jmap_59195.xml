Novel Approach for Side Weirs in Supercritical FlowAbstractSide weirs are hydraulic structures widely used in practice and extensively studied in the technical literature. The flow along a side weir is a classic example of spatially varied flow, the study of which is generally performed by means of a momentum or energy approach. The momentum approach is usually more accurate but requires the experimental estimation of correction coefficients leading to a formulation that is difficult to apply to a practical design. The energy approach, instead, is not as accurate when the flow depths on the side weir are significantly higher than the same weir crest. A novel, simplified theoretical model for the study of single side weir in a circular pipe, operating in supercritical flow, is proposed. The model originates from an experimental analysis of the flow power variation along the side weir. The proposed model has shown good performance in free surface representation and is capable of estimating the lateral outflow with good accuracy. The suggested formulation is compared with others of acknowledged value, showing comparable performance.
