Improving Distance Education for Students with Special Needs: A Qualitative Study of Students’ Experiences with an Online Library Research CourseThis article describes a study in which seven students with diverse disabilities participated in a one-credit online library research course which had been adapted to be accessible using the best practices literature on distance education for students with special needs. Students provided feedback on the design of the course and participated in in-depth interviews. Results of this study suggest any given class may have students with different types of disabilities, with different paths toward learning. Using the principles of universal design for learning can improve distance education not only for students with special needs, but for all types of learners. © 2014 Published with license by Taylor & Francis.
