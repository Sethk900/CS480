Helminths of Emoia caeruleocauda (Squamata: Scincidae) from the Northern Mariana Islands, MicronesiaOne hundred and ninety-eight Emoia caeruleocauda from nine of the Northern Mariana Islands, Micronesia were surveyed for helminths. Samples from Agrigan, Almagen, Anatahan, Asuncion, Pagan, Rota, Saipan, Sarigan and Tinian were examined. The helminth fauna was greatly depauperate: one species of Cestoda, Cylindrotaenia hickmani, one species of Nematoda, Skrjabinodon sheai and acanthocephalan cystacanths were found. Three of the larger islands, Agrigan, Rota and Saipan, contained two species of helminths. No helminths were found in E.Â caeruleocauda from Anatahan, Asuncion, Pagan and Tinian Islands.
