Two new Tarphius species from Macaronesia (Coleoptera, Zopheridae)Two new species of Tarphius are described: Tarphius desertaensis n. sp. sifted from saxicole lichens on the small islet of Deserta Grande, east of Madeira, and Tarphius jandiensis n. sp. from Fuerteventura, in the Canary Islands, where it lives in the upper parts of the massif of Jand√≠a as a relict of the once more hygrophilous fauna that inhabited the island. Both species are of small size and have a fairly convex body.
