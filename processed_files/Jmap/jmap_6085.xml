Effect of plant density, weed-crop interference and water stress on seed germination of Datura stramonium L.Field experiments were conducted during two growing seasons to determine the effect of different common thorn-apple (Datura stramonium L.) densities on seed germination. The study provided information on the implications of weed and weed seed infestation, where no weed control was applied. Maize (Zea mays L.) was planted in 2.1 m rows at a plant population of 16 000 plants haâˆ’1. D. stramonium was planted at five densities in association with maize. Harvested weed seeds were subjected to a series of germination tests. During both seasons the germination and vigour of the produced weed seeds declined with increased weed-crop interference. The data contribute towards timely, more effective and environmentally friendly weed control.
