Determining Ti source and distribution within a Paleustalf by micromorphology, submicroscopy and elemental analysisTitanium and zirconium were initially determined in a soil formed from granodiorite to assess parent material uniformity. The Ti distribution in the less than 2.0 mm fraction did not support parent material uniformity as did the Zr distribution and field morphology. Titanium source and distribution were subsequently determined to evaluate weathering of Ti-bearing minerals and mobility of Ti. Titanium contents measured by X-ray spectroscopy increased from the silt to the clay fraction from the C through the A horizons. Using petrographic microscope, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, and energy dispersive analysis of X-rays, ilmenite was identiffed as a Ti-bearing mineral, but Ti also occurred in discrete biotite, hornblende, sphene, opaque mineral particles, and in plasma, and cutans and subcutanic features. Oxalate extraction of the total soil produced small but notable amounts of Ti, especially in the Bt horizons. The data indicated that ilmenite, biotite, hornblende, and sphene may weather to produce Ti in argillans, ferriargillans, ferrans, neo- and quasiferrans, noncrystalline materials, and clay size particles in plasma. The data also indicated the mobility of Ti within and a net loss of Ti from the profile by translocation and leaching processes.
