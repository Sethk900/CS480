Seasonal variation of density and biomass of hydracarina (acari) in a north‚Äpatagonian reservoir (neuqu√©n, argentina)The variations in density and biomass of Hydracarina have been analyzed throughout a year in Ezequiel Ramos Mexia reservoir (Neuqu√©n, Argentina) as a part of an integrated study on zoobenthos. Four quantitative samples were collected monthly with a Ponar grab (400 cm2) in 1 littoral and 4 sublittoral zones from June 1983 to June 1984. Some limnochemical characteristics were measured at each site. Hydracarina imagines and nymphs were identified and quantified at species level. Mean annual density and wet biomass per zone ranged from 81 to 1936 ind/m2 and from 26.0 to 201.4 mg/m2 respectively. Both parameters decreased in November remaining minimum during the summer until February. The highest values were recorded in late February and late May reaching 6006 ind/m2 and 596.3 mg/m2 respectively. Species composition and relative dominance were considerably different among zones, with Oxus patagonicus, Neocalonys longipalpis, Hygrobates ampliatus and Limnesia patag√≥nica predominating. Parasitism of water mite larvae on Chironomidae imagines was recorded. The infestation incidence in collected specimens was between 2.9 and 8.9%, and its most frequent intensity was between 1 and 2 larvae per host.
