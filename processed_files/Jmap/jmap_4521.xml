Comparison of maize genotypes for grain yield, nitrogen uptake and use efficiency in Western EthiopiaNitrogen is the most limiting nutrient in the production of maize in western Ethiopia with its favourable climate for this crop. This is because Nitisols inherently low in N are used for maize production by resource-poor farmers who cannot afford fertilizer application. An option in combating this constraint is planting of maize genotypes that are efficient in N use. Experiments were therefore conducted to evaluate different maize genotypes for grain yield, N uptake and use efficiency at five sites. At each site two experiments, viz. one with open-pollinated genotypes and the other with hybrid genotypes were laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications. In each of these experiments either five open-pollinated genotypes or five hybrid genotypes were combined in complete factorial arrangement with six N fertilization levels ranging from 0 to 230 kg haâˆ’1 at 46 kg intervals. The results indicated that only two genotypes qualified as N use efficient, viz. the open-pollinated Ecaval 1 and the hybrid CML373/CML202/CML384. On average they outyielded their respective local genotypes by 5.9% at a low N application and by 17.5% at a high N application. Both genotypes also showed consistently higher N agronomic efficiency, N recovery efficiency and N physiological efficiency at low and high N applications. The introduction of these two N use efficient genotypes into the farming systems of the resource- poor farmers could be beneficial to them.
