An overview of the context and scope of wheat (Triticum aestivum) research in South Africa from 1983 to 2008The domestic requirement for wheat in South Africa is approximately 2.8 million tons and annually the shortfall on local production is imported to meet the demand. During the past 25 years two distinct wheat marketing mechanisms characterised the wheat industry, impacting significantly on both research and industry. In 1996 the single channel marketing system through the Wheat Board made way for a liberal marketing environment in which market forces of supply and demand determine price. This refocused most research activities on factors to lower input costs and risks, while increasing the profitability of wheat production. Significant challenges were experienced with much stricter milling and baking quality requirements impacting on not only the development of adapted wheat cultivars for South African conditions, but also on fertiliser and cultivar recommendations, as well as production practices. Minimum tillage, preharvest sprouting, as well as the threat of Russian wheat aphid and stripe rust were some of the pertinent challenges faced during this time. Significant scientific breakthroughs of international importance were made with regard to the physiological and biochemical nature of insect resistance and plant defence as well as the transfer of resistance genes from alien species. This review provides an overview of the most pertinent wheat research undertaken from 1983 to 2008.
