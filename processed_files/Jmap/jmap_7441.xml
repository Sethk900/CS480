Synopsis der neotropischen Pselliodidae (Chilopoda: Scutigeromorpha)Summary Synopsis of the Neotropical Pselliodidae (Chilopoda: Scutigeromorpha) Only two species of the family Pselliodidae occur in Central and South America, namely the common Pselliodes guildingii (Newport, 1844) and Pi. chagualensis Kraus, 1957 (only types known, Peru). All other species of Brasilophora and Pselliodes described by BÃ¼cherl and Chamberlin are synonymous with Ps. guildingii. Also Lassophora cujabana Verhoeff, 1944 which has been placed under the Scutigeridae is a synonym. The author proves these synonymies and describes Ps. guildingii nov. comb.
