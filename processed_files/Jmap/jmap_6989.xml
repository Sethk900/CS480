Activity pattern of Crotalus durissus (Viperidae, Crotalinae): Feeding, reproduction and snakebiteOne hundred and seventyâ€three adults and twentyâ€six juveniles of Crotalus durissus were examined by removing the stomach contents and faecal material. Rattlesnakes were most active between April and May (autumn) (unimodal type), but most intensive feeding occurred during summer and autumn (February to May). Juveniles were observed to feed from late autumn (May) through the winter. Prey consisted of rodents (Cavia aperea, Rattus norvegicus and Mus sp.) and no ontogenetic change was observed in the diet. Feeding peaks precede vitellogenesis (autumn â€ winter). Mated females continue feeding until ovulation (spring). It was observed that the biggest number of accidents were caused by snakes with stomach contents, especially males.
