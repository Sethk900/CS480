Two new species of benthopelagic Stephos (Copepoda, Calanoida, Stephidae) from KoreaTwo new species of benthopelagic copepods of the genus Stephos T. Scott, 1892, belonging to the family Stephidae G.O. Sars, 1902, are described based on specimens collected in the stagnant water flooding the burrows excavated by ocypodid crabs in two intertidal mud-flats, and from near-bottom shallow waters in Korea, respectively. They can be easily diagnosed based on the ornamentation of both the female genital double-somite and genital operculum; the morphology of the distal segment of the male right P5; the presence/absence of a tiny pointed process on the distomedial angle of second segment of female P5; and the condition (seta or spine) of the lateral armature element on the distal segment of female fifth legs, among other features. This is one of the few cases reported of calanoid copepods living as commensals of other invertebrates, and raises to six the number of members of the genus reported from Asia. This is also the first record of the family Stephidae in Korea.
