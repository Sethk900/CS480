Nitrogen fertilization of cabbages in NatalCabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata f. alba cv. Gloria Osena) yields were measured in two experiments on a Westleigh soil near Pietermaritzburg in response to different methods, rates and times of application of nitrogen fertilizer. Levels ranging from 0–375 kg N ha−1 were tested. The result was an almost linear increase in yield with increasing nitrogen up to the highest level applied in the first trial. In the second trial no significant increase in yield was recorded from 75 kg N ha−1 up to 375 kg N ha−1. In this trial nitrogen applied by banding and broadcasting produced similar results. There was a significantly better yield when half the nitrogen was applied before planting and half four weeks after transplanting, in comparison with all being applied before planting, or one third before planting with two top-dressings and one quarter before planting with three top-dressings.
