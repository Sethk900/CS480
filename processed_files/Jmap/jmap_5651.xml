The occurrence and phylogenetic implications of the ovipositor clip within the Figitidae (Insecta: Hymenoptera: Cynipoidea)The presence of the ovipositor clip is surveyed throughout Figitidae. This morphological structure is postulated to restrain the parasitoid host during oviposition. All Figitinae and Eucoilinae that attack semiâ€concealed dipterous hosts were found to possess the clip. Figitids that attack fully concealed hosts all lacked the ovipositor clip. It is hypothesized here that two subfamilies, the Anacharitinae and Aspicerinae, attack fully exposed hosts yet lack the clip in order to quickly oviposit and prevent fighting with the host. Mapping of the presence/absence of the ovipositor clip on to two competing phylogenies suggests this structure evolved in parallel in Figitinae and Eucoilinae. The evolution of the ovipositor clip is probably responsible for the successful colonization of semiâ€concealed dipterous larvae by Eucoilinae.
