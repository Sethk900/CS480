A procedure for determining the minimum bulk density of soilsThe purpose of this study was to establish a procedure and develop equipment for determining the minimum bulk density of soils. Six soils with silt-plus-clay contents varying between 8 and 41% were selected. The determination consisted of pouring the soil samples into moulds 100 mm high with 106 and 158 mm diameters from three different falling heights, viz. 150, 300 and 450 mm. The uniformity of packing of the soil particles was varied by including or excluding a sleeve equipped with a wire mesh in the procedure. A mould 106 mm in diameter and 100 mm high attached beneath a 150 mm long sleeve which had a wire mesh with 6.5 mm openings fitted 20 mm from the top, was found to be the apparatus producing the most reliable results. It has also been recommended that oven dried soil passed through a 2 mm sieve should be used.
