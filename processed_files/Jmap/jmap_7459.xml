Biological studies of Brazilian scolytidae and platypodidae (coleoptera). iv. the tribe cryphaliniAbstract Observations were made in Northâ€East Mato Grosso on eleven species of Cryphalini (Scolytidae) in the genera Cryptocarenus, Hypothenemus and Periocryphalus. Their distribution and host plants are discussed. Most species are probably polyphagous. Species in the genera Cryptocarenus and Periocryphalus are normally shoot borers making biramous longitudinal galleries in the pith of small twigs. C. heveae also attacks fruits. The habits of Hypothenemus species are more varied. H. bolivianus is a shoot borer. H. eruditus was found below bark, but it is known to have very varied habits. H. cylindricus was bred from stems, and H. obscurus was found attacking fruits, but both species are known to breed in either habitat.
