Track analysis and geographic distribution of some Lagenophrys Stein, 1852 (Protozoa: Ciliophora: Peritrichia) speciesRecords of species of the peritrich ciliate genus Lagenophrys, obligate epibionts of crustaceans, were analysed using panbiogeographical track analysis to detect its worldwide distribution patterns. Track analysis of 28 species of this genus found five generalized tracks: (1) Euroamerican; (2) American; (3) Caribbean; (4) Tasmanian; and (5) South American. Two panbiogeographic nodes were found at the intersection of generalized tracks 1 and 2, and 2 and 5. The distributions of the Lagenophrys species show complex patterns that could be related to trophic opportunities, habitat and distribution of hosts, and other factors. The distribution patterns suggest that a number of allopatric events have caused regionalization of the taxa.
