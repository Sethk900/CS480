Geosynthetic Filters for Water Quality Improvement of Urban Storm Water RunoffAbstractSuspended solids in highway storm water runoff create a wide range of water quality problems; their removal lessens the deleterious impact of storm water runoff on aquatic ecosystems. In this study, three geotextiles were tested in a laboratory setup with influent suspensions having a hydraulic loading rate, total suspended solids (TSS) concentration, and particle size distribution similar to those reported for urban highway storm water runoff. Results indicated that after a short ripening period, a geotextile with an apparent opening size of 150 μm can effectively remove suspended solids to below a target concentration of 30  mg/L. The results also showed that the change in hydraulic conductivity of the geotextile filter system can be related to suspended solids captured via a power function, which may be used to predict the flow rate through the filter during its life span. New retention criteria specifically for storm water filtration are introduced for geotextiles.
