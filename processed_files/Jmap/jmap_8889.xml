Web-Based Data, Document, and Knowledge Management in Restoration ProjectsThis paper gives an introduction to composition, creation, and management of knowledge using a long-term research project as an example. The concept and first experiences for a web-based knowledge management system (KMS) of the regeneration process of the stream Ilm (Thuringia, Germany) are presented. From 1996 until 2005, this restoration ecology project investigated whether the river ecosystem can attain its natural state again and how the regeneration can be influenced. The web-based content management system iZone, with an emphasis on information retrieval and feedback, was used to support the process of storage, retrieval, and visualization of existing information, several Ph.D. studies, and expert knowledge in the concluding phase of the research project. The resulting KMS at the moment stores 90 entries from 35 project scientists.
