Improving seed germination of Stylosanthes guianensis by means of warm water treatmentThe effect of different warm water treatments on the dormancy of hard-coated Stylosanthes guianensis seeds was investigated. Light and dark coloured seeds were placed into water at different temperatures. Warm water treatments induced a large number of soft-coated seeds. The optimum treatment for increasing germination percentage and germination rate was immersion in water at 60°C. Temperatures higher than 60°C led to a rapid decrease in germination due to loss of viability. Dark coloured seeds appeared to be more dormant than light coloured seeds.
