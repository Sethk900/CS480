Phosphate adsorption mechanisms in oxidic soils: Implications for P-availability to plantsFactors affecting P solubility were studied for four Hawaiian soils: the Waialua, Wahiawa, Halii and Honokaa series, classified, respectively, as: Haplustoll, Eutrustox, Gibbsihumox and Hydrandept. Phosphate solubility in the oxidic soils depended mainly on salt concentration and cation valency. It was decreased by the accompanying cation according to: K < Mg </ Ca. This cation effect on P solubility decreasedwith increasing contents of layer silicate clay minerals and/or increasing base saturation of the soil. Consequently, it was almost absent in the Haplustoll which contains montmorillonite and kaolinite. The P solubility in all four soils increased greatly when the pH was raised with NaOH. When Ca (OH)2 was used, however, this effect was almost completely eliminated due to the action of Ca ions. This result explains why in many fertility studies of oxidic soils even moderate liming rates were not found to increase the P availability. In a subsequent pot experiment evidence was obtained on the negative effect of the Ca ion on P uptake by Sudangrass from the Gibbsihumox and Eutrustox.
