Ascidiacea (Tunicata) from deep waters of the continental shelf of Western AustraliaSeventyâ€eight species of Ascidiacea, including 21 new species from deeper waters (about 100Â m and occasionally to about 500Â m) off Western Australia appear to represent a diverse fauna not previously sampled. The relatively few solitary species taken include two possibly introduced (Styela plicata and S. clava). Large aplousobranch colonies dominate the collections. Aplousobranch species with numerous, small, deeply embedded zooids in massive threeâ€dimensional, vertical and often branched or stalked inflexible colonies supported by embedded sand (Polyclinindae) or calcareous spicules (Didemnidae) are common. Species with flexible stalks (enabling them to respond to prevailing currents) such as Clavelina meridionalis, Sigillina australis and S. cyanea were not taken often. Some known species (e.g. Synoicum chrysanthemum, and Atriolum tubiporum) previously considered rare were taken at these depths in significant numbers. Other unusual taxa (Pseudodiazona longigona and Condominium spp.) are recorded from new locations but do not appear to be common.
