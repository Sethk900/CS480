On the species status of the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne mayaguensis Rammah & Hirschmann, 1988Abstract Holo- and paratypes of the root-knot nematodes Meloidogyne mayaguensis Rammah & Hirschmann, 1988 and Meloidogyne enterolobii Yang & Eisenback, 1983 were morphometrically and morphologically compared. All observed female, male and second-stage juvenile morphometrical and morphological characters are identical for the two studied species. Additionally, contradictions between the original species descriptions were unravelled. The present study of holo- and paratypes confirms the taxonomical status of Meloidogyne mayaguensis as a junior synonym for Meloidogyne enterolobii.
