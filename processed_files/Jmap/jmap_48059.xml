Herbivory in arid and semi-arid regions of ArgentinaTerrestrial herbivory in the Chaco, Monte and Patagonia natural regions of Argentina shows similar patterns to equivalent regions of North America, as well as distinctive features. Peculiarities include the near absence of native large herbivores, the high diversity and abundance of leaf-cuting ants, and a considerable number of plants showing adaptations against predation and for dispersion by large herbivores. All these features might be linked to evolutionary interactions with the diverse fauna of large herbivores which became extinct during the Pleistocene. Overgrazing from domestic ungulates in the Chaco has transformed the original parkland landscape provoking widespread encroachment of woody vegetation, the near extinction of grasslands and some of their largest herbivores, and an increment of medium-sized rodents, which, in tum, can keep the system in a new "disclimaxic" equilibrium. In the Monte and Patagonia the results of overgrazing on the natural vegetation have also been dramatic, although less spectacular in terms of landscape alteration. These characteristics suggest lines along which future research efforts could be focused.
