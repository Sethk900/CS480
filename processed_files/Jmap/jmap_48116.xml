Disjunct distribution of Szeptyckiella gen. nov. from New Caledonia and South China undermines the monophyly of Willowsiini (Collembola: Entomobryidae)Morphology of scales is an important taxonomical character at all levels of Entomobryidae taxonomy. A new scaled genus of Collembola, Szeptyckiella gen. nov., and three new species are described: Szeptyckiella boulouparica sp. nov. and Szeptyckiella sinelloides sp. nov. from New Caledonia, and Szeptyckiella lii sp. nov. from South China. The genus, assigned to Willowsiini, is characterized by pointed scales on the body, eyes and pigment absent, antennal apical bulb absent, dens lacking spines and scales, and bidentate mucro with a short basal spine. It is closest to Hawinella from Hawaii but the latter possesses a falcate mucro. However, its morphological characteristics and its disjunct distribution raise a number of problems. Its widely disjunct distribution is difficult to explain in terms of palaeobiogeographical or more recent dispersal events. The new genus is similar to Sinella without consideration of scales, although both genera are placed in different tribes following the current supra-generic classification of Entomobryidae. We discuss other cases of paired genera differing only by the presence or absence of scales, and placed in either Willowsiini or Entomobryini. On this basis, we assume that scale presence could independently occur in the former tribe, questioning the monophyly of the tribe Willowsiini.
