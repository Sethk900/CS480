Sistem√°tica del g√©nero Cheirodon (Pisces: Characidae) en Chile con descripti√≥n de una nueva especie. an√°lisis de Multivarianza.Abstract Systematics of the genus Cheirodon (Pisces: Characidae) in Chile with description of a new species. Multivariance analysis. Five species of the genus Cheirodon (Characidae) are described for Chile: Ch. pisciculus Girard, Ch. Galusdae Eigenmann, Ch. australe Eigenmann, Ch. intermptus interruptus (Jenyns), and Ch. kiliani nov. sp. Ch. kiliani is described as a new species based on the combination of patterns it presents on tricuspid teeth, the predorsal area is half naked of scales and the ventral procurrent rays of the caudal fin occupy almost half of caudal peduncle. Ch. i. interruptus is considered as an introduced species to Chile from Argentina. For each species, 21 morphometric and 12 meristic characters were considered for the analysis of Numerical Taxonomy and the Principal Component programs. The dendrogram groups the following species in one set: Ch. kiliani, Ch. pisciculus, Ch. galusdae and another with Ch. i. interruptus, Ch. australe. The species appear very similar in the cluster analysis. The principal component analysis shows the most load in the two first components referred to meristic characters and the third component to the morphometric ones. The components reveal the adaptations of all species to habitat, reproduction and swimming. An artificial key is proposed for the so‚Äcalled Cheirodontin‚ÄCharacids of Chile.
