Comparison of Germination and Seedling Characteristics of Wheat Varieties from China and Sudan under Salt StressThe seeds of six wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties from China (Xumai 30, Yang 10-13, and Yang 11-10) and Sudan (Argine, Buahin, and Elnilein) were cultured in NaCl solution containing (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 mM NaCl). Germination and early growth were determined. There were significant differences among salinity levels for water uptake, germination percentage, shoot and root length, dry weight, and salt tolerance index. At all salinity levels, the six varieties showed similar salt resistance, but each variety had different degrees of salt resistance. Argine had the highest germination percentage and germination index, and Yang 11-10 had the highest reduction of total dry weight. Elnilein had a better salt tolerance index than the other varieties. Elnilein is recommended for saline soils. We suggest that a simple germination test would be a useful selection tool to use in developing new wheat lines for production on saline soils.
