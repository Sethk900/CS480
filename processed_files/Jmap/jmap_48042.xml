Patterns of Nested Dispersion in a Tropical Ground Ant CommunityAnt nests are frequently reported to be overdispersed. Less commonly, interspecific interactions have been shown to- affect nest spacing. We here report on the pattern of dispersion of 15 ground ant species in four plots located on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. All plots showed significant evidence of both intra- and interspecific overdispersion. We hypothesize that the observed pattern of dispersion is the result of competition among all members of this set of species with similar requirements. Mechanisms which could produce this pattern are nest movement and the preferential predation on nonspecific founding queens and incipient colonies by established colonies.
