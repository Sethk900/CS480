Homeowners associations: Friend or foe to native desert avifauna? Conservation concerns and opportunities for researchThe rapid urbanization experienced in arid environments worldwide has raised the issue of how wildlife adapt to such drastic landscape changes. Along the periphery of many desert cities are housing developments governed by homeowners associations. These homeowners associations often place strict restrictions on planted vegetation which may have implications for bird usage, particularly for those dependent on thorny vegetation. However despite the potential negative effects of such restrictions, such organizations may offer promise as a means of maintaining consistent landscape cover over a large urban area. Consideration of such organizations, through research and education can provide a means of pursuing conservation practice in difficult urban areas.
