Integrated Approach to Water Allocation in River BasinsAbstractAvailable water resources are decreasing in river basins around the world. Some reseachers have suggested various indicators and methods that should be used to allocate water resources. This paper attempts an integrated approach to water allocation that accounts for a wide range of factors at the river basin level. Using the Hai, Huai, and Yellow River Basins of Shandong Province in China, 19 indicators were assimilated into a water scarcity index and weighted based on surveys collected from 82 multidisciplinary experts. Fuzzy set probability was then used to quantify water scarcity for each river basin. A water allocation method was also calculated using 13 indicators and objectively weighted using the analytical hierarchy process. Results show that all river basins in Shandong Province have severe water scarcity and highlight that economic factors play the most critical role in water scarcity, followed by water supply factors then water demand. Water allocation indicators were prioritized according to water resource pressure and utilization proportionality among districts in the Huai River Basin. The results should provide direction for future research.
