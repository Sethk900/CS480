Techniques for computer-assisted mapping of rangeland  change Management of grasslands subject to replacement by woody  species requires an understanding of the scales and patterns of  change and how to detect and express them. We used the  Jornada de1 Muerto Basin of southern New Mexico as a case  study, testing the suitability of Landsat Multi-Spectral Scanner  (MSS) data for detecting vegetation changes. Cycles of drought  and heavy grazing have apparently changed the once extensive  grasslands of the upland Jornada and surrounding areas gradu-  ally into a patchwork of shrublands and relict grasslands.  Integrated remote sensing and geographic information system  (GIS) techniques can facilitate automated detection of these  rangeland changes. A GIS was used to store and process two 4-  band, co-registered multi-temporal Landsat MSS scenes collect-  ed in July 1983 and August 1992. Scene-to-scene radiometric cal-  ibration was performed using a regression technique. The data  were then evaluated for changes 3 different ways using algo-  rithms based on 1) differences between the ‘red’ (chlorophyll  absorption) bands for the 2 scenes; 2) the Euclidean distances  between the ‘red’ and ‘near-infrared’ bands for the 2 scenes;  and 3) a standardized principal components analysis using all 8  MSS hands. A threshold of 3 standard deviations above the mean  was applied to each of the 3 resulting ‘change’ images to repre-  sent areas of extreme change. Correlations among these images  ranged between 0.83 and 0.95. We conclude these techniques can  identify successfully the patterns and extent of extreme change,  and thus have potential value for management of our rangelands  resources.
