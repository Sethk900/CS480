Parasitoids of larch sawfly, Pristiphora erichsonii (Hartig) (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae) in Changbai MountainsEight parasitoids, Cleptes semiauratus (L.) (Chrysididae), Himerta impuncta Sheng, Polyblastus (Labroctonus) westringi Holmgren, Olesicampe erythropyga (Holmgren), Campodorus sp. and Mesochorus sp. (Ichneumonidae), Tritneptis lophyrorum (Ruschka) (Pteromalidae) and Myxexoristops sp. (Tachinidae), reared from cocoons of Pristiphora erichsonii (Hartig) (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae) in Changbai Mountains, Jilin Province in 2009–2010, are reported. Four hyperparasitoids of P. erichsonii, Phygadeuon bidentatus (Uchida) and Phygadeuon rugulosus Gravenhorst and Trichopria sp. (Diapriidae) reared from Myxexoristops sp., Phygadeuon sp. reared from C. semiauratus, are reported for the first time. The account ratio of Chrysididae, Ichneumonidae, Tachinidae and Pteromalidae was 59.5, 5.6, 32.4 and 2.4%, respectively. The parasitism rates of parasitoids of P. erichsonii were 31.5% in May 2009, 19.8% in October 2009 and 15.9% in June 2010. The emergence periods of parasitoids were from 16 May to 7 June 2009.
