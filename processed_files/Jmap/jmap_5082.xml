Diverse plant taxa used by arboreal succineid snails as microhabitatsArboreal species of the family Succineidae (Gastropoda: Pulmonata) eat fungi, algae and diatoms and use plants as microhabitats. However, the specific plant taxa that arboreal succineids use have not been thoroughly examined. In this study, plant species used as microhabitats by two succineid species, Boninosuccinea ogasawarae (Pilsbry) and Boninosuccinea punctulispira (Pilsbry), were examined on the oceanic Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands in the western Pacific Ocean. Boninosuccinea ogasawarae and B. punctulispira were recorded on 23 (four introduced and 19 native) and 37 (four introduced and 33 native) plant species, respectively. More individuals of B. ogasawarae and B. punctulispira were found on abundant plant species than on rare plant species. No significant difference in snail density was found between the introduced (Bischofia javanica) and native (Ardisia sieboldii) tree species. Therefore B. ogasawarae and B. punctulispira may use introduced plants as well as native plants as microhabitats.
