Surface-water gley soils in Bangladesh: GenesisExtensive areas of periodically wet, acid soils in Bangladesh have a seasonally fluctuating pH of the surface horizon and evidence for net clay loss. Morphological, chemical, mineralogical and other data mainly on a typical profile of these surface-water gley soils indicate a clay loss of some 1.5 kg/dm' ; alteration of smectite to a soil chlorite, interlayered material with trapped ferrous iron; the consequent drop in C.E.C. of the clay fraction; and the presence of amorphous silica. The data were used to reconstruct a sequence of three soil forming processes: Vertisol formation, then argilluviation, followed by ferrolysis. Ferrolysis involves, in the wet season: reduction producing ferrous iron, which displaces part of the exchangeable basic cations and aluminium; leaching of bases and part of the aluminium; and interlayer formation by the remaining aluminium while some exchangeable ferrous iron is trapped in the interlayers. In the dry season, oxidation of exchangeable ferrous iron produces exchangeable hydrogen, part of which attacks the clay minerals and is neutralized by liberation of Al, Mg and other ions from the clay structure. Part of the silica remaining from the clay structure is leached out in the next wet season, part accumulates in amorphous form. In soils long used for paddy cultivation, man has concentrated the ferrolysis process in the ploughed layer by the formation of a slowly permeable ploughpan causing strong reduction only in the surface horizon. The hydromorphic albic horizon over more clayey material is indicative of the dominant process in surface-water gley soils. This sequum could usefully have a more important place in soil classification than it has at present, e.g. at great group level.
