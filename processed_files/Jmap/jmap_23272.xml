Acanoides gen. n., a new spider genus from China with a note on the taxonomic status of Acanthoneta Eskov & Marusik, 1992 (Araneae, Linyphiidae, Micronetinae)Abstract A new â€œmicronetineâ€ genus Acanoides gen. n. is erected to accommodate two species from China: Acanoides beijingensis sp. n. as the type species and Acanoides hengshanensis (Chen & Yin, 2000), comb. n., with the females described for the first time. The genitalic characters and somatic features of the new genus were studied by means of light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The monophyly of the new genus was tested by a phylogenetic analysis based on molecular data. Descriptions of the new genus, the new species and the new combination are presented; SEM images and microscopy pictures of somatic and genitalic characters are provided in detail. To distinguish from other genera with similar genitalic characters, we compare the new genus with the species of Acanthoneta Eskov & Marusik, 1992, Epibellowia Tanasevitch, 1996 and Wubanoides Eskov, 1986. Four putative synapomorphies for Acanoides gen. n. are suggested to support its monophyly that could be tested in the future. Furthermore, redescriptions of the epigynal morphology of Acanthoneta aggressa Chamberlin & Ivie, 1943 (Nearctic) and on the male of A. dokutchaevi Eskov & Marusik, 1993 (Far East Asia, firstly recorded from China) are provided. Based on comparison with Poeciloneta, from which Acanthoneta stat. n. was separated by Saaristo and Tanasevitch (1996), a revised diagnosis is proposed to support the generic status.
