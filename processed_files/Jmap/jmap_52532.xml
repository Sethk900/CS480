A test for sex-biased dispersal in the black-faced lion tamarin (Leontopithecus caissara): inferences from microsatellite markersIn social systems with high reproductive skew, the likelihood of breeding may depend on the dispersal ability of non-reproductive members. The aim of the present study was to test through microsatellite genotyping whether males and females of the cooperative breeding callitrichid primate Leontopithecus caissara disperse at similar proportions. Our results indicate that there is no sex-bias in dispersal. However, even-sexed and sex-bias dispersal reported for other callitrichid populations indicate that environmental and demographic attributes may also influence the dispersal pattern. Therefore, dispersal patterns may vary in a more complex fashion than previously thought in callitrichids.
