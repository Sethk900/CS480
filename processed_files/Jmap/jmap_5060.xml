Breeding biology of the golden parrotbill (Paradoxornis verreauxi) (Aves: Timaliidae) in southwestern ChinaWe report for the first time on aspects of the breeding biology of the golden parrotbill (Paradoxornis verreauxi), including descriptions of nests, eggs, nestlings and breeding behaviour. The nests were specialized, pensile, semi-domed, attached to bamboo (Fargesia spathacea) branches and constructed from leaves, fibrous roots and moss by both male and female birds. Nests were positioned on average 1.81 ± 0.29 m (n = 14) above the ground. Clutch size was 3.50 ± 0.67 (n = 12) and eggs were oval, pale blue in colour with a mean mass of 1.06 ± 0.07 g (n = 4). Incubation and provisioning of nestlings were carried out by both parents. The nesting success and fledging success were 38.89% (n = 18) and 2.83 ± 0.75 (n = 6), respectively. We discuss the differences in breeding parameters such as nest characteristics and egg colour compared with other parrotbill species.
