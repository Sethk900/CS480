Redescription of Lineus acutifrons Southern, 1913 (Nemertea: Pilidiophora) and comments on its phylogenetic positionThe nemertean Lineus acutifrons Southern (1913) is a species rarely encountered in sandy beaches of Europe and is only really known from its original and short description. This species has been found almost a century later in Galician sandy beaches (northwest Spain) and is re-described here. Data detailing its internal morphology and external anatomy, and digital photographs are included. In addition, sequences of the ribosomal gene 28S and the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I (CO1) were obtained. These sequences were used in a phylogenetic analysis to test its phylogenetic position with respect to other sequences available for pilidiophorans.
