Field reactions of lucerne genotypes to anthracnose and crown rot caused by Colletotrichum trifoliiNineteen different cultivars and experimental lines of lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) were inoculated with sand-bran cultures of Colletotrichum trifolii Bain & Essary and evaluated for resistance to anthracnose and crown rot under local conditions. The various genotypes differed significantly in their reaction to these two diseases. Nine were resistant to crown rot, whereas five were resistant to both crown rot and anthracnose. The South African cultivar S A Standard was more resistant to crown rot and anthracnose than most other cultivars imported from Australia and North America. This cultivar, however, has a low yield potential in comparison with other cultivars. Frequent harvesting caused an increase of crown rot among all cultivars.
