Eight Argentinean species of Dung-Inhabiting Philonthus Stephens (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae)Eight dung-inhabiting species of Philonthus Stephens that occur in Argentina are treated. A new species, P. bicoloristylus (Tucum√°n Province), is described and illustrated. Two native species, P. bonariensis Bernhauer and P. quadraticeps Boheman, are redescribed and illustrated for the first time. Additional notes are given for five more species widespread in Argentina and other countries: P. flavolimbatus Erichson, P. longicornis Stephens, P. pauxillus Solsky, P. rectangulus Sharp, and P. sericans (Gravenhorst). Philonthus iaynesi Bernhauer is considered a junior synonym of P. sericans (Gravenhorst) (syn. nov.). New distributional records and bionomic information for all species are presented, and a checklist of all Philonthus species currently known from Argentina and Chile is appended.
