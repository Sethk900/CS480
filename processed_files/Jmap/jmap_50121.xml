Reproduction of Agalychnis granulosa Cruz, 1989 (Anura: Hylidae)We provide a detailed description of the reproduction of the tree frog Agalychnis granulosa, including its advertisement call. Agalychnis granulosa breeds in ponds and the backwaters of streams within primary forests. The breeding season started at the beginning of the wet season and ended two months before the beginning of the dry season. Males called at night in the vegetation around the ponds at a maximum distance of 5 m from the water. The call was composed of a single note with three to seven pulses and a dominant frequency ranging from 1490 to 2101 Hz. Oviposition sites included tree trunks, attached leaves, fallen leaves and bromeliad roots, and ranged in height from 0 to 300 cm above the water. Egg clutches were composed of approximately 45 eggs encapsulated by a transparent gelatinous matrix. Empty egg capsules (4–7 per clutch) were recorded in 36% of the clutches. Great plasticity was observed in the reproductive strategies of A. granulosa, probably reflecting the varying competition and predation at the different life stages of the species.
