Change in CO2 balance under a series of forestry activities in a cool-temperate mixed forest with dense undergrowth.To evaluate the effects on CO<sub>2</sub> exchange of clearcutting a mixed forest and replacing it with a plantation, 4.5 years of continuous eddy covariance measurements of CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes and soil respiration measurements were conducted in a conifer-broadleaf mixed forest in Hokkaido, Japan. The mixed forest was a weak carbon sink (net ecosystem exchange, -;44 g C m<sup>-;2</sup> yr<sup>-;1</sup>), and it became a large carbon source (569 g C m<sup>-;2</sup> yr<sup>-;1</sup>) after clearcutting. However, the large emission in the harvest year rapidly decreased in the following 2 years (495 and 153 g C m<sup>-;2</sup> yr<sup>-;1</sup>, respectively) as the gross primary production (GPP) increased, while the total ecosystem respiration (RE) remained relatively stable. The rapid increase in GPP was attributed to an increase in biomass and photosynthetic activity of <em>Sasa</em> dwarf bamboo, an understory species. Soil respiration increased in the 3 years following clearcutting, in the first year mainly owing to the change in the gap ratio of the forest, and in the following years because of increased root respiration by the bamboo. The ratio of soil respiration to RE increased from 44% in the forest to nearly 100% after clearcutting, and aboveground parts of the vegetation contributed little to the RE although the respiration chamber measurements showed heterogeneous soil condition after clearcutting.
