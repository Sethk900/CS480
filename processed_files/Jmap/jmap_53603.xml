‘The adikeshavus-group’: A new species group of Idris Förster (Hymenoptera, Platygastridae) from India, with descriptions of five new speciesIdris Förster is a megagenus in the tribe Baeini comprising species that exclusively parasitize the eggs of spiders dwelling in vegetation and leaf litter. This is the only tribe in Platygastridae capable of using spider eggs for their development. Constructing species groups will facilitate studies of highly speciose genera like Idris. So far only one species group ‘the melleus-group’ has been proposed in this genus. A new species group ‘the adikeshavus-group’ from India is proposed. Five new species in this genus – I. adikeshavus, I. deergakombus, I. brevicornis, I. lopamudra and I. teestai – are described from India. All five species are imaged and a key to them is provided.
