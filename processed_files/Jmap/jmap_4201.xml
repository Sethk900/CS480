A new species of the genus Paramaka Savage & Dominguez, 1992 with some comments on related genera (Ephemeroptera, Leptophlebiidae, Atalophlebiinae)The genus Paramaka Savage & Dominguez, 1992 has been established to accommodate the species P. convexa (Spieth, 1943) described from Surinam. Here, we describe a new species, Paramaka antonii nov. sp. from (former British) Guyana. A cladistic analysis is performed on Paramaka and related genera such as Hydrosmilodon (four species), Needhamella ehrhardti (Ulmer, 1920) and Leentvaaria palpalis Demoulin, 1966. Our results put forward Hydrosmilodon as paraphyletic, with species recently described from French Guyana more closely related to L. palpalis than to others. The description of the winged stages of Leentvaaria is needed before carrying out any reassignment.
