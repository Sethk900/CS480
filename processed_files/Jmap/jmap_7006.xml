Metamorphic growthâ€gradient changes in South American loricariid catfishes Loricariichthys maculatus and Pseudohemiodon laticepsMetamorphosis is of particular interest in ecological and evolutionary studies because the decoupling of larval and adult growth patterns potentially allows the adaptive diversification of the separate stages. To better understand how differential growth patterns might contribute to evolutionary differences in body form, growth allometries in relation to interspecific morphometric differences were studied in two species of loricariid catfishes that can be completely discriminated in the smallest larvae examined. Many characters undergo metamorphic shifts in allometric growth rates, although the timing of the shifts seems to vary among characters. Interspecific allometric differences are highly correlated with the discriminatory values of the characters in larvae, but a comparable correlation is absent in adults. This suggests that metamorphosis serves to â€œreleaseâ€; adult growth patterns from phylogenetic constraints on growth.
