Effects of pocket gophers on the herbaceous vegetation growing in aspen meadowsWe investigated the effects of northern pocket gophers (Thomomys talpoides) on plant species diversity and biomass of herbaceous vegetation in aspen (Populus tremuloides) meadows through a series of 4 treatment plots. The treatments were control (no treatment), baited (pocket gopher removal), fenced (ungulate exclusion), and fenced-and-baited combined. When we compared baited plots to control plots or fenced-and-baited plots to fenced plots, we found that baiting reduced pocket gopher densities but had no effect on plant species diversity or herbaceous plant biomass, forb biomass, or grass biomass. However, there was a negative correlation between the number of pocket gopher mounds present in fenced plots and herbaceous plant biomass and grass biomass. At our study site, pocket gopher densities were not high enough to impact herbaceous vegetation.
