Mark—Recapture Accurately Estimates Census for Tuatara, a Burrowing Reptile.Estimates of population size are necessary for effective management of threatened and endangered species, but accurate estimation is often difficult when species are cryptic. We evaluated effectiveness of mark-recapture techniques using the Lincoln-Peterson estimator for predicting true census size of a population of tuatara (<em>Sphenodon punctatus</em>), a burrowing reptile that is a conservation priority in New Zealand. We found that Lincoln-Peterson estimates (<em>N</em> ˆ = 85) were accurate for predicting the census size (<em>N</em> = 87) after only a 3-day mark-recapture survey. We recommend this method as a cost-effective way to accurately estimate population size for isolated, inaccessible tuatara populations, because it requires limited personnel, expertise, and time, and has low environmental impact on fragile sites.
