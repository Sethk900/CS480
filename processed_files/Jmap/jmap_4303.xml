The Lizard Teius teyou (Squamata: Teiidae) as a Legitimate Seed Disperser in the Dry Chaco Forest of ArgentinaWe analyzed the occurrence and number of viable seeds in droppings of the lizard Teius teyou, and the influence of seed ingestion on the germination capacity of Ziziphus mistol seeds in dry Chaco forests of northwestern Argentina. Seeds were found in 59% of 607 droppings collected during the wet season, belonging to Ziziphus mistol (Rhamnaceae), Celtis pallida (Ulmaceae) and Capparis atamisquea (Capparaceae). Seeds of Z. mistol accounted for 98% of all seeds found in droppings. Seeds found in the droppings were viable, suggesting that lizards are legitimate seed dispersers. Passage through the lizard's digestive tract did not enhance germination of Z. mistol seeds. Lizards appear to be efficient dispersers of Z. mistol given that they usually defecate in open areas, a favorable condition for the establishment of Z. mistol.
