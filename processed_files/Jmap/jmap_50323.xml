Chromosomal diversification in ribosomal DNA sites in Ancistrus Kner, 1854 (Loricariidae, Ancistrini) from three hydrographic basins of Mato Grosso, BrazilAbstract Populations of seven Ancistrus species were analyzed from streams and rivers of three hydrographic Brazilian basins. All populations showed different diploid numbers (2n), fundamental numbers (FNs), and karyotypes. Some representatives of Loricariidae have 2n = 54 chromosomes, which is very likely an ancestral cytotaxonomic characteristic, but many other representatives show extensive karyotype diversification. In the Ancistrus species studied, extensive karyotypic differentiation, which is generally associated with chromosome number reduction and rearrangement of the ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) sites, was verified. Chromosomal locations of 18S and 5S rDNA were jointly detected using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In all the Ancistrus species analyzed, 18S rDNA sites were detected only on one chromosome pair, though this differed among species. 5S rDNA was located on 1â€“3 chromosome pairs either separately or in synteny with 18S rDNA in four of the seven species/populations. Hence the karyotype differentiation in Ancistrus species could be associated with a morphological speciation process, suggesting that chromosome fusions, inversions, deletions, duplications, and heterochromatination could contribute to the karyotype evolution of these neotropical armored catfishes.
