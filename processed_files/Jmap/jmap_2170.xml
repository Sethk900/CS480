Comparison of gas use efficiency and treatment uniformity in a forest ecosystem exposed to elevated [CO2] using pure and prediluted free-air CO2 enrichment technology.A direct comparison of treatment uniformity and CO<sub>2</sub> use of pure and prediluted free-air CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment (FACE) systems was conducted in a forest ecosystem. A vertical release pure CO<sub>2</sub> fumigation system was superimposed on an existing prediluted CO<sub>2</sub> fumigation system and operated on alternate days. The FACE system using prediluted CO<sub>2</sub> fumigation technology exhibited less temporal and spatial variability than the pure CO<sub>2</sub> fumigation system. The pure CO<sub>2</sub> fumigation system tended to over-fumigate the upwind portions of the plot and used 25% more CO<sub>2</sub> than the prediluted CO<sub>2</sub> fumigation system. The increased CO<sub>2</sub> use by the pure CO<sub>2</sub> system was exacerbated at low wind speeds. It is not clear if this phenomenon will also be observed in plots with smaller diameters and low-stature vegetation.
