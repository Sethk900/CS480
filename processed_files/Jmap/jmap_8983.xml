Variations of horizontal and vertical velocities over two-dimensional transverse dunes: A wind tunnel simulation of the effect of windward slopeThe changes in wind velocity induced by dune topography have an important significance in dune dynamics. In this paper, the horizontal and vertical velocities over six transverse dune models were measured non-intrusively by means of Particle Image Velocimetry in a wind tunnel. The windward slope angle and the free-stream wind velocity both affected the horizontal and vertical velocity components. On the windward side, the acceleration of horizontal velocity depended mainly on the windward slope angle and the height above the dune surface, but was also affected by the free-stream wind velocity. The speed-up ratio increased with increasing slope angle but decreased with increasing height. The ascending vertical velocities also increased with increasing slope angle and free-stream wind velocity. The maximum values moved upper along the dune when the windward angle became steeper. In the leeward sides, the horizontal velocity decreased and reversed because of airflow separation; the maximum reverse velocity in the separation cell was about 17% of the free-stream wind velocity. Behind the dune crest, the airflow moves downwards, and its maximum downward velocity is found near the flow reattachment point. Finally, we discussed the significance of these velocity variations for sediment transport and dune dynamics.
