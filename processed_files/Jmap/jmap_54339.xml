Pedogenesis of two Ultisols (Red Earth Soils) on granite in Belize, Central AmericaTwo Ultisols (Red Earth soils) developed from granitic rock under mid-tropical conditions in Belize, Central America were studied. The long-term weathering processes have produced a reddish solum overlaying reddish C horizons which grade into saprolitic material. Although the chemical data indicated that both profiles were strongly weathered, illite was relatively stable and kaolinite contents increased towards the soil surface. The kaolinite content was markedly higher and quartz and feldspars were lower in the older soil (Profile 1). The goethite and hematite contents increased upwards and Al substitution was greater for geothite than hematite in both profiles. Micromorphological analyses showed that mica has survived as muscovite rods in sepic and mosepic plasmic fabrics, plagioclase grains disintegrated along microcracks and quartz grains developed a crazejoint planes pattern before breaking down into fine individual particles. The presence of void, grain and embedded cutans were evidence of in situ weathering of mica and other weatherable minerals. No apparent sign of illuviation could be found in the B horizons; however, void argillans were clear evidence of illuviation within the saprolite zone. A high amount of plasma in the solum suggests that most of the secondary products of weatherable minerals remain in the soil and there is a considerable loss of Si from quartz and other silicates, since the amounts of Si are very high in the parent materials.
