Comparison of methods for estimating cation exchange capacity of orchard soilsVarious methods for estimating soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) were compared. CEC obtained by the sum of extractable cations and the Adams-Evans buffer method were considerably higher than those obtained by saturation and displacement of either NH4 + or Na+. Isotopie dilution and the Ag-thiourea method gave similar CEC values which were considerably lower than those obtained with NH4CI at field pH. The latter values were obtained from relatively dilute solutions and are expected to give a good approximation of CEC under field conditions.
