Human influence, plant landscape evolution and climate inferences from the archaeobotanical records of the Wadi Teshuinat area (Libyan Sahara).Central Sahara rock shelters offer an early and middle Holocene environmental reconstruction. This paper summarises palynological research carried out within a multidisciplinary archaeological research project on the Wadi Teshuinat area (Tadrart Acacus Mts., in south-western Fezzan, Libya). The sites were occupied by hunter-gatherer and pastoralist cultures. On-site pollen data, treated as a single 'regional site', showed that different pollen stratigraphies and flora characterised the past phases. Plant macro-remains also helped to understand local plant exploitation and landscape evolution. Pollen spectra showed the following climate oscillations: wet and cool (approx. 8800-8250 cal. BC), dry and warm (approx. 7920-7520 cal. BC), wet (approx. 7550-7200 cal. BC), dry (approx. 6340-6210 cal. BC-geoarchaeological evidence), wet and warm (approx. 6250-4300 cal. BC, including a wetter and warmer phase at approx. 5500-4600 cal. BC); dry and warm (approx. 4250-2900 cal. BC); drier and warm (approx. 2900-1600 cal. BC, up to the present). Since the early Holocene, both climatic and anthropic factors have played an important and strictly interconnected role in transforming the environment. Thus, while subsistence strategies were adjusting to climatic and environmental changes, the plant landscape was also being slowly and continuously shaped by humans.
