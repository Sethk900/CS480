The morphology and biology of Pterodunga mirabile Daccordi, an unusual subsocial Chrysomeline (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)New information is provided on the morphology and biology of the Australian leaf‚Äbeetle Pterodunga mirabile Daccordi. This species is unusual in the Chrysomelinae for the following features: adult with deeply grooved prothoracic hypopleuron, laterally pointed elytral margins, concealed mesoventrite and fused abdominal ventrites; female ovoviviparous and without spermatheca; first‚Äinstar larva with lappet‚Älike sclerites; maternal care; host plant in the Proteaceae. The systematic position and conservation status of Pterodunga are discussed. Maternal care in the Chrysomelinae and Proteaceae‚Äfeeding in the Chrysomelidae are reviewed. The first record of maternal care in Chrysomelinae, for Labidomera suturella Gu√©rin‚ÄM√©neville, is shown to be a misidentification of Platyphora selvae Daccordi.
