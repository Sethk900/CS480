The first survey on harvestmen in Brazilian artificial cavities, with notes on distribution and natural historySeveral species of harvestmen occur in natural subterranean cavities using these habitats as shelters and sites of oviposition. Many species have evolved in these environments, thus becoming cave-dwellers. In a few cases harvestmen have been reported in artificial cavities (mines), but without details about their distribution or natural history. Based on faunal inventories carried out in 111 artificial cavities in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, this work aimed to register species of harvestmen that are associated with these artificial cavities. Seventeen species were found in 12 municipalities, in addition to new occurrences for 14 of these species and some new behavioral notes. Two undescribed species were also recorded. This study highlights that artificial cavities may be used as shelters by harvestmen, mainly in human-modified landscapes.
