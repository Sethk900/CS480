The influence of Demeton-S-Methyl/Parathion and Imidacloprid on the yield and quality of Russian wheat aphid resistant and susceptible wheat cultivarsRussian wheat aphid, (Diuraphis noxia) causes severe damage to wheat in South Africa and producers have been forced to use insecticides for control. Plant resistance to Russian wheat aphid has been successfully transferred into bread wheat cultivars. A split plot field trial was undertaken firstly to compare the yield of susceptible wheat to that of a near-isogenic resistant wheat cultivar in combination with insecticide treatments and secondly to determine whether the inclusion of Russian wheat aphid resistance influences the bread- making quality of the cultivar. Resistant wheat yielded higher indicating that the resistance is effective under field conditions. Seed treatment with Imidacloprid increased yield of wheat in both years. Significant two and three-way interactions were found in both years. No negative effects on dough quality characteristics were associated with Russian wheat aphid resistance.
