Solution and associated features of limestone fragments in a calcareous soil (lithic calcixeroll) from Southern FranceThree pedological features, associated with hard, residual fragments of limestone from a calcareous soil profile from southern France, have been observed and analysed in thin sections. There are corrosion pits and galleries in the fragments, amorphous and iron-rich films on the surfaces of the fragments, and calcium oxalate (weddellite) globules on the surfaces of these films. Soil microorganisms would appear to be largely responsible for the formation of these features. This would show that biological interventions may constitute a more effective weathering agent in some soils developed from hard limestone parent rock in a mediterranean environment.
