â€˜Water and fertilizer influence on yield of grain sorghum varieties produced in Burkina FasoGrain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is the major cereal crop used in the Central Plateau of Burkina Faso to produce the traditional beer called â€œdoloâ€. Experiments combining five water management techniques (WMT) and four fertilizer treatments (FT) in a randomized complete block design with a split-plot arrangement of treatments were conducted from 2003 to 2005. Water management techniques were allocated to main plots and FT to subplots. The objective was to determine the best cropping practice to optimize yields for two red grain sorghum varieties, IRAT9 and ICSV1001 (Framida), commonly used for dolo production. Results indicated that water conservation using tied-ridges produced higher grain yields. The highest yield benefit was 241 kg haâˆ’1 for Framida. In the IRAT9 field, the highest yield benefit of 395 kg haâˆ’1occurred in the lowest rainfall year (736 mm) of 2005. In all years, microdose consisting of application of 19 kg N haâˆ’1, 19 kg P haâˆ’1 and 19 kg K haâˆ’1 as complex fertilizer NPK at planting, with addition of 20 kg P haâˆ’1 as triple super phosphate at planting in the planting hole and 30 kg N haâˆ’1 as urea applied 45 days after planting (microdose + 20 kg P haâˆ’1 + 30 kg N haâˆ’1) produced the highest grain yield increases from 420 to 756 kg haâˆ’1 for Framida and from 812 to 1346 kg haâˆ’1 for IRAT9. In the IRAT9 field, microdose + 20 kg P haâˆ’1 + 30 kg N haâˆ’1 produced the highest grain yield in all WM treatments, with yield increases from 518 to 1327 kg haâˆ’1 depending on the WMT. Correlations indicated that the number of panicles harvested haâˆ’1 were associated with grain yield for the two varieties. The best cropping system to optimize grain yield of Framida and IRAT9 was the use of tied-ridges and application of micro-dose + 20 kg P haâˆ’1 + 30 kg N haâˆ’1.
