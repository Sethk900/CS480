Short-term simulated nitrogen deposition increases carbon sequestration in a Pleioblastus amarus plantationIn order to understand the influence of nitrogen (N) deposition on the key processes relevant to the carbon (C) balance in a bamboo plantation, a two-year field experiment involving the simulated deposition of N in a Pleioblastus amarus plantation was conducted in the rainy region of SW China. Four levels of N treatments: control (no N added), low-N (50 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), medium-N (150 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), and high-N (300 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) were set in the present study. The results showed that soil respiration followed a clear seasonal pattern, with the maximum rates in mid-summer and the minimum in late winter. The annual cumulative soil respiration was 585+/-43 g CO(2)-C m(-2) year(-1) in the control plots. Simulated N deposition significantly increased the mean annual soil respiration rate, fine root biomass, soil microbial biomass C (MBC), and N concentration in fine roots and fresh leaf litter. Soil respirations exhibited a positive exponential relationship with soil temperature, and a linear relationship with MBC. The net primary production (NPP) ranged from 10.95 to 15.01 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) and was higher than the annual soil respiration (5.85 to 7.62 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) in all treatments. Simulated N deposition increased the net ecosystem production (NEP), and there was a significant difference between the control and high N treatment NEP, whereas, the difference of NEP among control, low-N, and medium-N was not significant. Results suggest that N controlled the primary production in this bamboo plantation ecosystem. Simulated N deposition increased the C sequestration of the P. amarus plantation ecosystem through increasing the plant C pool, though CO(2) emission through soil respiration was also enhanced.
