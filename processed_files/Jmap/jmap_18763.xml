Soil respiration and carbon balance of gray forest soils as affected by land useSoil respiration was measured by closed chamber and gradient methods in soils under forest, sown meadow and crops. Annual total soil respiration determined with the closed chamber method ranged from 180 to 642 g CO2-C m(-2) year(-1) and from 145 to 382 g CO2-C m(-2) year(-1) determined with the CO2 profile method. Soil respiration increased in the order: cropland < sown meadow < forest. The C balance calculated as the difference between net primary production (sink) and respiration of heterotrophs (source) suggested an equilibrium between the input and output of C in the cropland, and sequestration of 135 and 387 g CO2-C m(-2) year(-1) in the forest and meadow, respectively.
