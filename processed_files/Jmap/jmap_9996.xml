Marine Holocene Ostracoda from the Pacific Coast of North and Central AmericaThis paper describes and illustrates 80 species of Holocene Ostracoda from nearshore localities in the Pacific Ocean along the coasts of the United States, Mexico and Nicaragua. Sixteen of the species are new. The four new genera are Acuminocythere, Palmoconcha, Lucasocythere, and Perspicytherois. Of the species studied by the writers herein and previously, nine are restricted in known distribution to the Pacific coast of the United States north of Point Conception, California, while 43 are restricted to the Pacific coast of the United States south of Point Conception, California, and to those of Mexico and Central America. Six of the species recorded from the bay at San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua, have not been found elsewhere. The northern assemblage shows a slight relationship with North Atlantic and northwestern Pacific ostracodes. The southern assemblage shows clearer relationships with ostracodes from the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean region, including forms as old as the Miocene and possibly the Oligocene. The distinction between the two assemblages is probably caused by coastal water temperatures that are controlled by the cool California Current on the north and the North Pacific Current on the south.
