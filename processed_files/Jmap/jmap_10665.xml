Space and Habitat Use by a Red Wolf Pack and Their Pups During Pup-RearingDuring summer 2005, we evaluated space and habitat use by red wolves (Canis rufus) during pup-rearing. Home-range sizes for red wolves (3 ad, 3 juv, and 4 pups) varied from 3.48 km2 to 12.24 km2. Red wolves selected agricultural fields over adjacent forested areas and used less space during pup-rearing than we expected based on prior knowledge of the species. Attending pack members rarely left pups alone, pack members shared pup-rearing duties, and male red wolves appeared to play a significant role in pup-rearing.
