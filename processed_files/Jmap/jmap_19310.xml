Linking tree biodiversity to belowground process in a young tropical plantation: Impacts on soil CO2 fluxThis study examined the effect of tree species identity and diversity on soil respiration in a 3-year-old tropical tree biodiversity plantation in Central Panama. We hypothesized that tree pairs in mixed-species plots would have higher soil respiration rates than those in monoculture plots as a result of increased primary productivity and complementarity leading to greater root and microbial biomass and soil respiration. In addition to soil respiration, we measured potential controls including root, tree, and microbial biomass, soil moisture, surface temperature, bulk density. Over the course of the wet season, soil respiration decreased from the June highs (7.2 +/- 3.5 mu mol CO2/(m(2) s(-1)) to a low of 2.3 +/- 1.9 mu mol CO2/(m(2) s(-1)) in the last 2 weeks of October. The lowest rates of soil respiration were at the peak of the dry season (1.0 +/- 0.7 mu mol CO2/(m(2) s(-1))). Contrary to our hypothesis, soil respiration was 19-31% higher in monoculture than in pairs and plots with higher diversity in the dry and rainy seasons. Although tree biomass was significantly higher in pairs and plots with higher diversity, there were no significant differences in either root or microbial biomass between monoculture and two-species pairs. Path analyses allow the comparison of different pathways relating soil respiration to either biotic or abiotic controls factors. The path linking crown volume to soil temperature then respiration has the highest correlation, with a value of 0.560, suggesting that canopy controls on soil climate may drive soil respiration.
