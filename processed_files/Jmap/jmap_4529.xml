A comparison between hydroponics systems and pots for growing wheat in the greenhouseGrowing wheat hydroponically for crossing block and germplasm multiplication purposes may hold emergence, yield and seed quality advantages compared to traditional planting methods. The aim of this study was to compare wheat planted in pots with soil to hydroponically grown wheat in terms of emergence and yield and yield components. Two wheat cultivars, Baviaans and Steenbras, were evaluated in two identical hydroponic systems using two different nutritional solutions, and in pots with soil. The two hydroponic systems provided a better emergence environment compared to the potting solution. For both Baviaans and Steenbras, in the chemicult solution, higher values for measurements were observed than in their pot solution-planted counterparts. For all yield related characteristics, the hydroponic cultivation methods yielded superior results to the potting cultivation method. The chemicult solution resulted in higher yields than the Bugbee solution. It can be concluded that wheat can be grown more effectively in a hydroponics system in the greenhouse than in pots with soil, using a chemicult rather than the Bugbee solution.
