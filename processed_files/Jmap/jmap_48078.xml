Seasonal population fluctuation and spatial distribution of Orthoptera in two grassland areas of Attica – GreeceThe aim of this study was to investigate the seasonal population fluctuation of orthopteran assemblages and determine the spatial distribution of the most abundant species of Orthoptera among two habitats in Greece. A 2-year study was performed in a lowland area and in a mountain grassland area. The family of Acrididae represented almost 75% of the total orthopteran relative abundance in both sampling areas. Dociostaurus maroccanus and Chorthippus bornhalmi were found to be the most abundant species in the lowland and the mountain sampling stations, respectively. Most populated species were spatially aggregated in the lowland station, whereas the abundant species were found to be distributed either aggregately or randomly among sampling units in the mountain area. Shannon–Wiener index estimate was higher for the lowland in 2007 than for the mountain, whereas the opposite was found in 2008. The factors affecting the population dynamics of Orthoptera are discussed.
