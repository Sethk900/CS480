Biology of Glossoscolex uruguayensis (Glossoscolecidae, Oligochaeta). A new species for ArgentinaSummary Glossoscolex uruguayensis Cordero, 1943, is described on material from Santa Fe (Argentina) with special reference to its blood system. The latter shows deviation from textâ€book descriptions in lacking subneural, supraâ€oesophageal vessels and dorsal vessel anterior to VII. The extraâ€oesophageals supply and/or drain the testisâ€sac, calciferous glands, gizzard and nephridial clusters of IVâ€V and substitute the dorsal vessel in IVâ€III. The nephridia are holoic, avesiculate, asphinctate, acaecate and tufted. It is introduced to Santa Fe and is parthenogenetic. G. corderoi Righi 1968 is synonymized with G. uruguayensis.
