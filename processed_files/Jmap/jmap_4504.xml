Effect of cultivar, seedling age and leaf clipping on establishment, growth and yield of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) transplantsThis study explored the viability of intensifying pearl millet and sorghum production through use of nurseries and transplanting to address the problem of poor stand establishment. The experiments were carried out over two seasons, the 1999/2000 and 2000/2001 seasons in the south eastern lowveld of Zimbabwe where the mean rainfall is less than 500 mm per annum. Treatments included two pearl millet cultivars (PMV2 and PMV3) and two sorghum cultivars (Mutode and Macia). These crops were transplanted with and without leaf clipping at three seedling ages (30, 40 and 50 days for pearl millet; 29, 39 and 49 days for sorghum). Transplants were raised in nursery seedbeds. In the 1999/2000 season, there were significant effects of cultivar (P<0.05) and leaf clipping (P<0.01) on pearl millet grain yield. Clipped seedlings yielded 932 kg ha−1 compared to 797 kg ha−1 for non-clipped seedlings while PMV3 yielded 902 kg ha−1 compared to 820 kg ha−1 for non-clipped seedlings. Mutode yielded significantly (P<0.05) higher than Macia in both seasons, however, leaf clipping tended to increase yields for both cultivars. An increase in seedling age from 29 days also tended to reduce yields. It was concluded that leaf clipping of 30-day old seedlings at transplanting may enhance sorghum and pearl millet yields in the semi-arid tropics.
