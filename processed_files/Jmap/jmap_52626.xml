The enigmatic Black Tinamou: Do distribution, climate, and vocalizations reveal more than one species?The Black Tinamou (Tinamus osgoodi) is a rare species with 2 recognized subspecies distributed locally. This is one of the most poorly known tinamous; few sound recordings exist, and few behavioral or sighting records are found in the literature or in ornithological databases. We compiled all the information on its geographic distribution and climate to provide a greater understanding of its current distribution. We also compiled all available sound recordings of the species in order to perform bioacoustic analyses to evaluate differences between subspecies. The 2 subspecies seem to be isolated by an ample distance, and each inhabits an area with a distinct climate. We also found some differences between their vocalizations. Future work should consider reevaluating the taxonomic status of the 2 subspecies. Conservation status of the resulting taxa must be reassessed, although more information on their ecology and natural history is needed.
