Edible biomass production from some important browse species in the Sahelian zone of West AfricaAcacia senegal, Guiera senegalensis and Pterocarpus lucens, browse species important in the Sahelian zone of Burkina Faso were studied by the estimation of their phenological variation over time and the evaluation of edible biomass production, total and accessible directly to animals. Biomass production was also estimated using dendrometric parameters. All the three species started the foliation phase as soon as the rains started. A. senegal and P. lucens flowered before G. senegalensis and A. senegal lost leaves earlier. The fruiting phase lasted 6â€“7 months for all species. Accessible edible biomass varied according to the animal species, the plant species and the height of plants. G. senegalensis showed the highest proportion of accessible biomass, but P. lucens had higher total edible biomass. Goats browsing at higher height had more edible biomass at their disposal. The accessible edible biomass was weakly correlated with tree parameters, while crown diameter was the best parameter to predict total edible biomass production, with R2 varying from 90% (G. senegalensis) to 98% (P. lucens) in log10 transformation of dependent and independent variables. The single species models developed could be applied in similar agro-ecological zones, taking into account the height stratification of plants. Further investigations on others species are needed to be able to estimate total biomass available for browsing.
