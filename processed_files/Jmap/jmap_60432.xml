Use of hyperspectral derivative ratios in the red-edge region to identify plant stress responses to gas leaksHyperspectral features in the red-edge region were tested as an index of plant stress responses to soilâoxygen depletion. The aim was to provide the basis for a warning system to identify natural gas leakage by the spectral responses of plants growing in the affected soil.Elevated concentrations of natural gas in the soil atmosphere were used to deplete oxygen concentrations around the roots of grass, wheat (Hordeum vulgare cv Claire) and bean (Vicia faba cv Clipper) growing in a field facility. Visible symptoms due to the natural gas included reduced growth of the plants and chlorosis of the leaves.Spectral responses included increased reflectance in the visible wavelengths and decreased reflectance in the near infra-red. Derivative analysis identified features within the red-edge at 720â730 and 702 nm. Ratios of the magnitude of the derivative at 725 to that at 702 nm were less in areas where gas was present. This ratio enabled identification of stress due to gas leakage up to 7 days before visible symptoms were observed and also at the edges of gassed plots where visible symptoms were not expressed. The technique was able to identify stress responses to long-term leaks in all the crops tested but to short-term leaks only in grass. This study therefore suggests that under appropriate conditions remote sensing could be used to detect pipeline gas leaks from decreases in the ratio of peaks within the red-edge.
