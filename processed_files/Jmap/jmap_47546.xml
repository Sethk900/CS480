Short spatial and temporal scale patterns of fish assemblages in a subtropical rainforest mountain streamThe fish fauna of a subtropical mountain stream in Argentina was surveyed for the first time. The abundance and occurrence of species were explored considering variation in hydrology, seasonality and the abiotic environment. We collected 221 individuals of 23 species from 10 families and four orders. Small sized species and small individuals dominated the fish fauna. The small characid Astyanax saguazu was the most conspicuous species. Hydrology, seasonal changes in water temperature and variation in water conductivity affected the abundance and distribution of fish. Hypobrycon maromba is recorded in Argentina for the first time.
