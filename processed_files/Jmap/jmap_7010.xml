Actividad temporal del mara (Dolichotis patagonum) en el desierto del Monte, ArgentinaThe mara is a caviid rodent, endemic and resident in the arid region of central and south Argentina. Little is known about its ecology in the wild, but its diurnal and superterrestrial way of life rises interest concerning its temporal activity rhythms related to environmental variables, as well as behavioural strategies for the speciesâ€™ adaptation to semiâ€desert environments. Surveys over two or three consecutive days were made from March 1982 to March 1983 and from October 1986 to July 1988, recording the number of active animals and environmental variables. It was demonstrated that the annual activity of D. patagonum was positively influenced by light, precipitation and temperature and negatively by darkness and relative humidity. These variables probably influence the longâ€term endogenous rhythms of the species. The daily activity was unimodal in winter and bimodal in the other seasons, and it was related especially with temperature. A favourable thermal environment was detected near 20Â° C. Daily activity of mara reduced during winter and summer with alternate periods of activity and rest, probably related to the species energetic balance. These strategies are important for the successful adaptation of the mara to Monte environment.
