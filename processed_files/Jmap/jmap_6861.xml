Pygmodispus (Pygmodispus) bicornutus spec. nov., a New Phoretic Mite Species from South America (Acari, Heterostigmata, Scutacaridae)The description of the mite species Pygmodispus (P.) bicornutus spec. nov. is presented. Females of the new scutacarid species were found to be phoretic on the dung beetles Aphodius lividus and Ataenius sp.. The beetles were collected from two pasture areas in southeastern Brazil (SÃ£o Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul). Other specimens of P. (P.) bicornutus spec. nov. were extracted from a soil sample collected in Santa Cruz Island, Galapagos. It is suggested that the new species has evolved on the South American mainland and reached the Galapagos Islands by phoretic means.
