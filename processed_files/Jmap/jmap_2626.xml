INVASIVE CORDGRASS MODIFIES WETLAND TROPHIC FUNCTION.Vascular plants strongly control belowground environments in most ecosystems. Invasion by vascular plants in coastal wetlands, and by cordgrasses (<em>Spartina</em> spp.) in particular, are increasing in incidence globally, with dramatic ecosystem-level consequences. We examined the trophic consequences of invasion by a <em>Spartina</em> hybrid (<em>S. alterniflora</em> Ã— <em>S. foliosa</em>) in San Francisco Bay (USA) by documenting differences in biomass and trophic structure of benthic communities between sediments invaded by <em>Spartina</em> and uninvaded sediments. We found the invaded system shifted from an algae-based to a detritus-based food web. We then tested for a relationship between diet and tolerance to invasion, hypothesizing that species that consume <em>Spartina</em> detritus are more likely to inhabit invaded sediments than those that consume surface algae. Infaunal diets were initially examined with natural abundance stable isotope analyses and application of mixing models, but these yielded an ambiguous picture of food sources. Therefore, we conducted isotopic enrichment experiments by providing <sup>15</sup>N-labeled <em>Spartina</em> detritus both on and below the sediment surface in areas that either contained <em>Spartina</em> or were unvegetated. Capitellid and nereid polychaetes, and oligochaetes, groups shown to persist following <em>Spartina</em> invasion of San Francisco Bay tidal flats, took up <sup>15</sup>N from labeled native and invasive <em>Spartina</em> detritus. In contrast, we found that amphipods, bivalves, and other taxa less tolerant to invasion consumed primarily surficial algae, based on <sup>13</sup>C enrichment experiments. Habitat (<em>Spartina</em> vs. unvegetated patches) and location of detritus (on or within sediments) did not affect <sup>15</sup>N uptake from detritus. Our investigations support a â€œtrophic shiftâ€ model for ecosystem response to wetland plant invasion and preview loss of key trophic support for fishes and migratory birds by shifting dominance to species not widely consumed by species at higher trophic levels.
