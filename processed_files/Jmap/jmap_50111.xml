Two new fossil wasps (Insecta: Hymenoptera: Apocrita) from northeastern ChinaPraeaulacus obtutus sp. nov., assigned to the subfamily of Praeaulacinae Rasnitsyn, 1972 in the family Praeaulacidae, Rasnitsyn, 1972, and Proapocritus bialatus sp. nov., in the family Ephialtitidae, are described and illustrated. These specimens were collected from the Middle Jurassic of Jiulongshan Formation at Daohugou in Inner Mongolia, northeastern China. Praeaulacus obtutus sp. nov. was erected by a combination of differential characters: the short and stout mesosoma, pronotum comparatively long, mesonotum not very long, the combination of pronotum and mesonotum transversely ridged and nearly arched; long hind legs. Proapocritus bialatus sp. nov. is assigned to Proapocritus Rasnitsyn, 1975 due to the following characters: wings venation complete, forewing with 1-Rs directed slightly posterodistally; 1r-rs, 2r-m, 3r-m, 2m-cu, 2A and a1-a2 present; hind wing with enclosed cell; Rs originating not basad of M + Cu fork. These findings provide new characters of these two groups and broaden the diversity of Praeaulacus and Proapocritus.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:BBC9B0D6-7E07-4A26-A975-21FFAEADE8B6
