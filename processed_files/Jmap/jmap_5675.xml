The early stages and breeding sites of four rare saproxylic hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae) from SpainThe puparial stage is described for each of four saproxylic hoverflies (Diptera, Syrphidae): Ferdinandea fumipennis Kassebeer, 1999, Mallota dusmeti Andr√©u, 1926, Myolepta difformis Strobl, 1909, and Myolepta obscura Becher, 1882. Early stages were collected at Caba√±eros National Park in Ciudad Real province, central Spain. Mallota dusmeti, M. difformis, and M. obscura were found in water‚Äfilled holes of live Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl. trees and the larva of F. fumipennis was found in a sap run on a live Quercus pyrenaica Wild. tree. Larvae were identified by rearing them to the adult stage. Puparia of these species possessed generic‚Älevel characters found in congenerics. Apparent species‚Älevel characters separating them from early stages of congenerics are proposed. The records reported here are the first for the Iberian Peninsula of M. obscura. Mallota dusmeti, M. difformis, and Myolepta obscura are extremely rare in Europe with M. dusmeti classed as ‚Äúvulnerable‚Ä in the Spanish Invertebrate Red Data Book.
