Investigating environmental factors that cause extreme gluten quality deficiency in winter wheat (               Triticum aestivum               L.)Unstable breadmaking quality of wheat due to environmental influence has been a problem for Norwegian milling industries. Large variation in gluten quality was observed from field trials with Norwegian winter wheat conducted in several locations between 2005 and 2013. Moreover, extremely poor gluten quality was observed in several locations in the 2007 and 2011 season, and indicated almost complete loss of breadmaking quality. To investigate the environmental factors which cause extremely weak gluten, gluten proteins were characterized in samples selected within the 2011 season. The results revealed that the proportion of large glutenin polymers decreased in wheat samples with extremely weak gluten. Moreover, re-polymerization of large glutenin polymers, which normally occur during the resting period of a dough, did not take place in gluten prepared from these samples. Incubation of total proteins extracted from these samples in an in vitro system showed a drastic degradation of gluten proteins indicating protease activities. The origin of the proteases remains unclear; however, exogenous proteases derived from Fusarium spp. seem to play a key role for protein degradation, and thus causing severe quality deficiency. A genotypic difference was found between the two cultivars and one of them had higher resistance against the factors influencing gluten quality in negative way.
