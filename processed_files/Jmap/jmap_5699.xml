Geographical variation in the golden‚Ästriped salamander, Chioglossa lusitanica Bocage, 1864 and the description of a newly recognized subspeciesMorphological and genetic data for the Iberian golden‚Ästriped salamander, Chioglossa lusitanica, demonstrate the existence of two groups with southern and northern ranges, connected by a zone of intergradation in central Portugal. Because reproductive isolation between them is incomplete we consider the groups to be subspecies. The type locality of C. lusitanica (Bu√ßaco near Lous√£) is situated inside the mixed zone. This necessitates identification of the nominotypical subspecies. We sequenced a fragment of mitochondrial DNA from one of the species' syntypes and we determined what position over a latitudinal transect maximizes the morphological discrimination between the groups. Both approaches indicate that C. lusitanica from Bu√ßaco represents the southern subspecies. A new subspecies of C. lusitanica is described from a northern locality (Valongo near Porto in north‚Äwestern Portugal). A lectotype is designated for Chioglossa lusitanica.
