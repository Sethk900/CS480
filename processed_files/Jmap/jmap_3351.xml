Maladaptive changes in multiple traits caused by fishing: impediments to population recoverySome overharvested ï¬sh populations fail to recover even after considerable reductions in ï¬shing pressure. The reasons are unclear but may involve genetic changes in life history traits that are detrimental to population growth when natural environmental factors prevail. We empirically modelled this process by subjecting populations of a harvested marine ï¬sh, the Atlantic silverside, to experimental size-biased ï¬shing regimes over ï¬ve generations and then measured correlated responses across multiple traits. Populations where large ï¬sh were selectively harvested (as in most ï¬sheries) displayed substantial declines in fecundity, egg volume, larval size at hatch, larval viability, larval growth rates, food consumption rate and conversion efï¬ciency, vertebral number, and willingness to forage. These genetically based changes in numerous traits generally reduce the capacity for population recovery.
