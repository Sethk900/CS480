Timing and Rate of Chaparral Treatment Affects Tall Fescue Seedhead Development and Pasture Plant DensitiesThe herbicide, Chaparral, has been shown to suppress seedhead development in tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum) pastures and reduce the symptoms of tall fescue toxicosis in cattle. However, little is known about the logistics of herbicide treatment on tall fescue pastures. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of three rates of Chaparral on tall fescue pasture when applied at three times (October, March, and April) during the growing season. Chaparral reduced seedhead densities of tall fescue on all treatment dates, but the highest levels of suppression were achieved with a late-spring treatment, when tall fescue was in the early stages of reproductive growth. This treatment was also the least detrimental to tall fescue plant densities. Chaparral applied to vegetative tall fescue in the early spring had the least effect on seedhead densities but significantly reduced the density of tall fescue crowns. Other species of grass began to encroach into tall fescue stands following herbicide treatment during the fall and early spring. Delaying Chaparral until late spring may be more effective for producers because it may allow for greater control of seedheads with less loss in tall fescue and the potential for higher forage yields. There was some effect of suppressing reproductive growth of tall fescue with a fall treatment of Chaparral, but more research may be needed to evaluate its merit over a late-spring treatment.
