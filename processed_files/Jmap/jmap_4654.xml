Soils and the environment: the past 25 yearsLocal work on selected environmental impacts on soil quality and the role of soils in the attenuation of environmental pollution is reviewed. Examples of negative impacts from mining, industries, urbanization, agriculture and forestry abound. The safe and sustainable use of various waste products may impact positively, but norms and standards are needed. Soil nutrient deficiencies or excesses give rise to nutrition-related disorders in humans and animals. Through bioremediation, soil becomes an ally in restoring environmental health. Harmonization of agricultural production and the environment is a political target towards which science must provide effective decision support. The development and application of a national environmental monitoring and evaluation system is needed for incorporating environmental data, information, norms and standards into a holistic picture. There is a need for improved cross-linking and synergy between various sectors impacting on the environment. The local government level is becoming critical to environmental management. The safe and sustainable use of sewage sludge/fly ash combinations on agricultural soils is suggested to be a highly promising future avenue of environmental R&D.
