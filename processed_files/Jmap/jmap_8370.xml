Growth and foliar δ15N of a Mojave desert shrub in relation to soil hydrological dynamicsSoil matric potential (ψmatric) was modeled for two years at four sites with different soil profile characteristics. Canopy volumes and foliar 15N ratios (δ15N) of Larrea tridentata were related to average soil water availability (ψmatric) and the modeled duration of available soil water (consecutive days ψmatric > −6.0 MPa). Weakly developed soils on young (Holocene) alluvial deposits had the longest duration (129 d) and highest ψmatric (−1.8 MPa), compared to soils with moderate horizon development in intermediate-aged (late Pleistocene) deposits (80 d, −4.3 MPa) and in soils with strong horizons on old (mid-late Pleistocene) deposits (20 d, −3.2 MPa). Plant canopy volume was highest in weakly developed soils (2.23 m3 ± 0.342 SE) than in moderately or strongly developed older soils (0.57 m3 ± 0.082 SE; 0.56 m3 ± 0.123 SE, respectively). The fourth site possessed a soil with a silt- and clay-rich horizon beneath a strong stone pavement, and had the shortest, most water-limited regime (13 d; −5.5 MPa) and smallest plant canopies (0.46 m3 ± 0.073 SE). Foliar δ15N variation was better explained by average ψmatric (R2 = 0.69; p ≤ 0.001) than duration of available soil water (R2 = 0.49; p ≤ 0.001). Together, these findings suggest soil hydrological regimes establish thresholds for plant growth, and plant N-dynamics are tightly coupled to desert soil hydrological characteristics.
