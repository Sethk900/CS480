Systematics and biology of Xylocopa subgenus Schonnherria (Hymenoptera, Apidae) in ArgentinaBiological information on the species of the large carpenter bee Xylocopa subgenus Schonnherria occurring in Argentina is revised. Based on the appraisal of museum specimens, the study of type material, and field surveys conducted across 15 provinces between 2007 and 2011, the following seven species are recognized for the country: X. bambusae Schrottky, X. chrysopoda Schrottky, X. macrops Lepeletier de Saint Fargeau, X. simillima Smith X. splendidula Lepeletier de Saint Fargeau, X. pulchra Smith, and X. viridis Smith. Previous literature records of X. dimidiata Latreille, X. subcyanea PÃ©rez, and X. varians Smith for the province of Misiones appear to have been misidentified specimens, although the presence of these species in Argentina cannot be entirely ruled out given the proximity of this province to Brazil and Paraguay where they occur; X. boops Maidl was described from a male specimen with unusually enlarged eyes and is newly synonymized under X. macrops. Males and females of all species are diagnosed, described, and figured, including details of the male genitalia. Taxonomic comments, data on the geographical distribution and nesting substrates, and identification keys to all Argentinean species of Schonnherria are provided. The nesting biologies of X. splendidula and X. viridis are documented.
