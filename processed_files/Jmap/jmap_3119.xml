Decrease of sage grouse Centrocerus urophasianus after ploughing of sagebrush steppeThe effects on wildlife of ploughing sagebrush Artemisia spp. steppe have been little studied. From 1973 to 1984, numbers of lekking male sage grouse Centrocerus urophasianus declined by 73% in a study area of south central Montana, 16% of which was ploughed by 1984. The proportion of ploughed wintering areas increased from 10% in 1975 to 30% in 1984. In contrast, numbers of lekking male sage grouse on a nearby unploughed control area showed no clear long-term trend. Ploughing even small areas of sagebrush steppe to produce cereal grains appears more detrimental to sage grouse than chemical control of sagebrush.
