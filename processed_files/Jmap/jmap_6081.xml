Differential susceptibility of commercial zucchini cultivars to viruses of cucurbitsA study to assess the effectiveness of some zucchini [Cucurbita pepo (L.)] cultivars in limiting the effects of virus disease in zucchini crops was conducted at Bayne's Drift, KwaZulu-Natal. The severity of disease was assessed using a visual rating scale. No yield data was collected. ‘SQ 229’, ‘Puma’, ‘SQ 228’ and ‘Gemma’ offered some control. These cultivars may be useful in increasing production in areas severely affected by the virus diseases considered in the study.
