The fate of 15N added to high Arctic tundra to mimic increased inputs of atmospheric nitrogen released from a melting snowpack.Increases in the long-range aerial transport of reactive N species from low to high latitudes will lead to increased accumulation in the Arctic snowpack, followed by release during the early summer thaw. We followed the release of simulated snowpack N, and its subsequent fate over three growing seasons, on two contrasting high Arctic tundra types on Spitsbergen (79Â°N). Applications of <sup>15</sup>N (99 atom%) at 0.1 and 0.5 g N m<sup>-;2</sup> were made immediately after snowmelt in 2001 as either Na<sup>15</sup>NO<sub>3</sub> or <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. These applications are approximately 1 &times; and 5 &times; the yearly atmospheric deposition rates. The vegetation at the principal experimental site was dominated by bryophytes and <em>Salix polaris</em> while at the second site, vegetation included bryophytes, graminoids and lichens. Audits of the applied <sup>15</sup>N were undertaken, over two or three growing seasons, by determining the amounts of labeled N in the soil (0-3 and 3-10 cm), soil microbial biomass and different vegetation fractions.
