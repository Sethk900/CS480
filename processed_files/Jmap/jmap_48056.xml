Colonisation of Clearcut Forests by Ants in the Southern Finnish Taiga: A Quantitative SurveyWe assessed the colonisation of clearcut forests by ants by using pitfall-trap data collected from clearcut areas of different age in southern Finland. We compared mature forests (age over 120 yr) with areas cleared 0, 2 and 10 yr before trapping. We concluded that the old-forest wood-ant systems are destroyed by clear-cutting, and that this is probably based on the loss of food resources. In the colonisation stage the role of stochasticity is counter-balanced by a number of deterministic species-specific factors in the succession of ant assemblages. In the colonisation process pioneering species are capable of founding colonies independently by single queens, and they are followed by species known to found colonies by temporary parasitism. In later successional stages new colonies are established mainly by fission. In the succession, species richness was highest in the ten year-old clearcuts. Later, species richness decreased, probably because of increased shade of the canopy cover. The ant species we studied did not show clear seasonal segregation, probably because of the shortness of the northern summer. Ecologically similar species pairs tended to show exclusive spatial distributions that may reflect interspecific competition.
