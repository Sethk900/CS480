At the crossroads from Asia to Europe: spring migration of raptors and black storks in Dadia National Park (Greece)Migrating raptors and black storks (Ciconia nigra) were studied in Dadia National Park, Greece, during spring 2003–2005. Vantage points and transects were used to evaluate magnitude, phenology, local variation and direction. We observed 23 species and 2030 individuals, including 715 common buzzards (Buteo buteo), 547 black storks and 136 short-toed eagles (Circaetus gallicus). Species-specific migration peaks were detected, starting in the second half of March, e.g. common buzzard, short-toed eagle, black stork, and ending early May, e.g. Levant sparrowhawk (Accipiter brevipes), red-footed falcon (Falco vespertinus), honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus). Most raptors were observed in the Evros valley, which may function as a migration corridor. The average direction of passing raptors was north. Species’ proportions and phenology in the study area were similar to those in neighbouring Bosphorus and Marmara Flyways. Further migration monitoring should be established in the area, which will provide important information not least to inform wind farm development location.
