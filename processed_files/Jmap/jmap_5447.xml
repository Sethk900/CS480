 Life history of the spider Selenops occultus Mello‚ÄLeit√£o (Araneae, Selenopidae) from Brazil with notes on the natural history of the genusSelenopids are extremely fast‚Ämoving, dorsoventrally flattened spiders and are among the most secretive of animals. However, they can be locally abundant, providing an opportunity to examine their life and natural histories. Here we report life history data from Selenops occultus which were studied and collected monthly for over a year at an experimental farm of S√£o Paulo State University in Botucatu, Brazil. We compare these data with what we have found in other Selenops species in the Caribbean region. Overall, S. occultus showed considerable seasonality. Males were most common in January and March, whereas females were more common in June and November. Significant differences between the numbers of males collected during the wet and dry seasons indicate that mating may be limited to the wet season. The Caribbean species share similar natural histories to S. occultus, such as little conflict in small areas and overlapping generations throughout the year.
