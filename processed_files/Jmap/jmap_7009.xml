Um teste de germina√ß√£o em sementes dispersas por macacos‚ÄAranha em Marac√°, Roraima; BrasilSpider monkeys play an important role in seed dispersion due to their huge consumption of mainly ripe fruits throughout the year. The seeds eaten pass the guts undamaged and are carried over distances up to 2 km before they are dropped. To test germination success of dispersed seeds, 10 plant species were compared. Samples were made both from faecal material and fallen fruits and were checked weekly. A small sample of focal trees belonging to two species tested, was also monitored to estimate seed germination and early seedling mortality in situ. All results indicate higher rates of germination and reduction of the period of germination for the seeds dispersed.
