Two New species of Farrodes from continental South America with comments on the distribution of faunal components in Argentina (Ephemeroptera: Leptophlebiidae)Two new species of Farrodes Peters are described. These new species are the first records of Farrodes from continental South America and Argentina, and represent a southward range extension of roughly 4.500 km. Both primary faunal components of Neotropical Leptophlebiidae are present in the northâ€argentinean province of Tucuman (27Â° S). However, these two faunal components are geographically separated along a temperatureâ€elevation gradient. Farrodes and Thraulodes Ulmer of the Guiana & Brazilian Shields, Warmâ€Adapted Genera are common in streams at elevations below 1,550 m. In contrast, the leptophlebiid fauna at elevations above 2,000 m is composed entirely of Patagonian Shield, South Andean, Coldâ€Adapted Genera with Meridialaris Peters & Edmunds and Massartellopsis Demoulin being particularly abundant. Streams between 1,550â€“2,000 m in TucumÃ¡n Province remain uncollected and the elevation and conditions at which faunal mixing or replacement occurs remain unknown.
