A Method for Obtaining Sage Grouse Age and Sex Ratios from Wings247 sage grouse wings from birds of known sex and/or age were used in establishing aging and sexing criteria. Depending on the molt stage of the bird, age determination is based on the condition of the outer two primaries or the difference in length between primaries 8 and 9. Sex determination is based on the length of individual primaries.
