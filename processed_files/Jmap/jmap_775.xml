Home-range sizes of social groups of Mongolian gerbils Meriones unguiculatus.Spacing behavior is important to the population regulation and social organization of rodents. However, little is known regarding the factors influencing space use by rodent social groups. We tested the hypotheses that food resources in the typical steppe would be so abundant that food availability would not be a limiting factor of home-range sizes of social groups of Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus). We also assessed the effects of social organization on the home-range size of social groups of gerbils, using capture-recapture methods. Home ranges of social groups of Mongolian gerbils did not differ in size between the breeding and non-breeding periods; however, home ranges overlapped more during the breeding period than during the non-breeding period. Overlap of home ranges might allow male gerbils to access female mates of neighboring colonies during the breeding period. Home-range sizes of social groups were positively related to number of males during the breeding period, but positively related to group size and number of females during the non-breeding period. Therefore, social organization influenced home-range sizes of social groups. Our hypothesis that food availability is not a limiting factor of space use by social groups of Mongolian gerbils from spring through autumn was supported.
