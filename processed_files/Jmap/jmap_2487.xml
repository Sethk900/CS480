ECOHYDROLOGY IN A COLORADO RIVER RIPARIAN FOREST: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DECLINE OF POPULUS FREMONTII.<em>Populus fremontii</em> (Fremont cottonwood) was once a dominant species in desert riparian forests but has been increasingly replaced by the exotic invasive <em>Tamarix ramosissima</em> (saltcedar). Interspecific competition, reduced flooding frequency, and increased salinity have been implicated in the widespread decline of <em>P. fremontii</em>. To elucidate some of the multiple and interacting mechanisms of this decline, we examined ecological processes in a control stand of <em>P. fremontii</em> along the Colorado River in Utah, USA, as well as a disturbed stand characterized by high groundwater salinity and invasion of <em>T. ramosissima</em>. Sap flux data showed that <em>P. fremontii</em> at the saline site experienced large reductions in afternoon canopy stomatal conductance relative to the control. Thus, average daily stand transpiration was 4.8 ± 0.1 mm/d at the saline site in comparison to 9.3 ± 0.2 mm/d at the control site over a two-month period. Light-saturated photosynthesis and apparent quantum yield were also reduced in saline <em>P. fremontii</em>. Stable isotope analysis indicated that trees at the saline site utilized evaporatively enriched groundwater that was likely derived from a nearby pond of irrigation runoff; this was also the probable source of high salinity. Interspecific competition for water at the saline site is unlikely, as <em>T. ramosissima</em> is still a minor species that is present only in the understory. However, reduced tissue N content in <em>P. fremontii</em> at the saline site suggested that physiological stress during salinity and halophyte invasion may be exacerbated by altered N relations.
