The accumulation of nitrate in Kikuyu grass (Pennisetum clandestinum Hochst)A study was made of some of the factors responsible for the accumulation of excessive amounts of nitrate in certain Kikuyu pastures. Accumulation, mainly in stem tissue, is the nett result of several contributing processes. Climatic conditions causing a decline in the requirements of the plant for assimilated nitrogenous substances, stimulate accumulation. High fertilizer-N applications and the re-cycling of nitrogenous substances in the pasture seem to be of considerable significance. These high soil nitrogen levels in conjunction with high potassium levels in the soil, aiding nitrate absorption, translocation and accumulation, seem to be major factors responsible for the accumulation of nitrate, especially in old Kikuyu pastures.
