Anti-biofouling 3D porous systems: the blend effect of oxazoline-based oligomers on chitosan scaffoldsThe production, characterization and anti-biofouling activity of 3D porous scaffolds combining different blends of chitosan and oxazoline-based antimicrobial oligomers is reported. The incorporation of ammonium quaternized oligo(2-oxazoline)s into the composition of the scaffold enhances the stability of the chitosan scaffold under physiological conditions as well as its ability to repel protein adsorption. The blended scaffolds showed mean pore sizes in the range of 18-32 μm, a good pore interconnectivity and high porosity, as well as a large surface area, ultimate key features for anti-biofouling applications. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) adhesion profiles showed that the composition of the scaffolds plays a critical role in the chitosan-oligooxazoline system. Oligobisoxazoline-enriched scaffolds (20% w/w, CB8020) decreased protein adsorption (BSA) by up to 70%. Moreover, 1 mg of CB8020 was able to kill 99.9% of Escherichia coli cells upon contact, demonstrating its potential as promising material for production of tailored non-fouling 3D structures to be used in the construction of novel devices with applications in the biomedical field and water treatment processes.
