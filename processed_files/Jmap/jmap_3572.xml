Observations on nest site selection and litter size in the Gray shrew (Notiosorex crawfordi) from Presidio County, TexasThis study reports on nest site selection and litter size in the gray shrew Notiosorex crawfordi, from two locations in Presidio County, Texas, Shafter Mine (SM) and Bunton Flat (BF) which lie in the northern region of the Chihuahuan Desert. This is the first study on these parameters for N. crawfordi from this region of Texas. At both sites active shrews were most frequently observed under decaying leaves of lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla) and Torry yucca (Yucca treculeana) which had fallen to the ground, as well as under mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) and creosote (Larrea divaricata) shrubs. All nests were found under decaying leaves of lechuguilla or Torrey yucca. Nests were constructed out of grass stems and leaf fragments and had a small, central cavity ranging from 1.8 - 3.0 cm in diameter. Most nests (68.6%) contained two side-openings, while the remainder had only one. Litter sizes ranged from 3 - 5 at SM (n = 7) as compared to 1 - 3 at BF (n = 12).
