Effects of amendments of paper mill sludge and nutrients on soil surface CO2 flux in northern hardwood forestsSafe and economical disposal of paper mill sludge is a key consideration for forest products industry. A study was conducted to examine the effects of amendments of sludge and nutrients on soil surface CO2 flux (Rs) in northern hardwood forests and to quantify the relationship among Rs, soil temperature, and moisture in these stands. The experiment was a randomized complete block design that included sludge-amended, fertilized, and control treatments in sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh) dominated hardwood forests in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA. Results showed that Rs was positively correlated to soil temperature (R-2 = 0.80, p < 0.001), but was poorly correlated to soil moisture. Soil moisture positively affected the Rs only in the sludge-amended treatment. The Rs was significantly greater in the sludge-amended treatment than in the fertilized (p = 0.033) and the control (p = 0.048) treatments. The maximum Rs in the sludge-amended treatment was 8.8 mu mol CO2 center dot m(-2) center dot s(-1), 91% and 126% greater than those in the fertilized (4.6 mu mol CO2 center dot m(-2) center dot s(-1)) and control (3.9 mu mol CO2 center dot m(-2) center dot s(-1)) treatments, respectively. The Rs did not differ significantly between the fertilized and control treatments. The difference in Rs between sludge-amended and the other treatments decreased with time following treatment.
