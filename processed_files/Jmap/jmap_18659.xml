SOIL RESPIRATION IN RELATION TO MICROBIAL BIOMASS IN A TROPICAL DECIDUOUS FOREST FLOOR FROM INDIAIn a tropical deciduous forest floor from India, monthly variation of soil respiration was observed to be governed by soil moisture and temperatures soil fungal and bacterial biomass showed positive realtionship with the rate of soil respiration. Annual contributions of fungi and bacteria to the total soil respiration were estimated to be 331 and 41 g C-CO2 m-2 respectively.
