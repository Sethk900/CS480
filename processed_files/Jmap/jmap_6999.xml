Adult forms confirming the specific identity were recovered from experimental infections of domestic chicks and laboratory mice. The first intermediate host of this parasite is Melanoides tuberculata, its role in transmission of the infection was assessed by experiments with aquarium Guppies and Cercariae shed from naturally infected snails. Both, the snail and the trematode were introduced in the American continent.
