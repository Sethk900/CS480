Studies on the predatory biology of Oriental dacetine ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) II. Novel prey specialization in Pyramica bentenThe predatory biology of the ant Pyramica benten, a shortâ€mandibulate form in the tribe Dacetini, Myrmicinae, was studied in the field and laboratory. Pyramica benten prefers disturbed habitats, where they hunt predominantly collembolans of Entomobryidae. Laboratory observation and experiments revealed that this ant hunted such entomobryids more efficiently than collembolans of Tomocelidae and Isotomidae. The hunting behaviour of the ants is characterized by their grabbing the prey near the mouthparts and ambushing without approaching the prey. Success in this stealthy hunting is most probably enhanced by luring the prey with body smearing using organic material. Strumigenys are closely related to Pyramica but they are longâ€mandibulate forms. Both genera are speciose and specialized predators on Collembola. Coleoptera is another group that has evolved specialized predators on Collembola so these dacetines and the coleopterans are compared for their hunting tactics and species diversity.
