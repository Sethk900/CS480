Predatory Behavior of the Opossum Didelphis albiventris on the Pitviper Bothrops jararacaThe predatory behavior of Didelphis albiventris (Didelphidae) on Bothrops jararaca (Viperidae) was described from encounters provoked in captivity. One adult and four young opossums presented the same behavior when killing and ingesting the snakes. Opossums subjugated the snakes by biting them in the head or neck region and began ingestion by eating this part first. The total time spent in subjugation plus ingestion was 24:23 min (SD = 8:08 min). Although D. albiventris is resistant to snake venom, the behavioral sequence observed is, probably, not a specialization for snake predation. It probably consists of a general and primitive pattern of prey manipulation observed in carnivorous mammals.
