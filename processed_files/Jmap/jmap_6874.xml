Seasonal diet composition in the Crested bobwhite in savannas of central-eastern VenezuelaThe diet of Crested Bobwhite (Colinus cristatus, Phasianidae) in a non-flooded savanna located in central-eastern Venezuela was studied. Food items obtained from crops were sorted, counted, and identified mostly to species level. Birds are omnivorous and their diets comprised mostly seeds, some invertebrates, and green vegetation; besides, they consumed snail shells during the breeding season. Seeds dominated in the diet during most of the year but the relative use of seeds, invertebrates, and green vegetation changed seasonally. Some management guidelines in order to increase the abundance of this important game bird in neotropical savannas are proposed.
