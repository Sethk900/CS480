Structure and dynamics of chironomid fauna from a sand dune marsh in rio de Janeiro state, BrazilThe benthic fauna of a sandâ€dune marsh in a restinga environment was monthly sampled from January, 1987, to February, 1988, using a 0.4 mm mesh width benthos collector apparatus. An amount of 43484 chironomid larvae were collected, corresponding to 15.2% from the total of the invertebrate benthic fauna sampled. The average densities were 3180.70 Â± 2641.41 ind./m2 for frequency, and 0.0737 Â± 0.0691 g/m2 for iomass. The following genera were found: Ablabesmyia, Clinotanypus, Coelotanypus, Labrundinia, Larsia (?), Monopelopia, Procladius, Chironomus, Goeldichironomus, Nimbocera, Polypedilum and Zavreliella. Concerning feeding habits, gut content analysis showed that the species are generalists, feeding on any available source. Product moment correlation was performed to verify associations between the taxa and environmental factors. Water level variation and the macrophyte life cycles are the main directive factors on chironomid populational fluctuations.
