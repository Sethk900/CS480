Discovery of Hemilepistus elongatus Budde-Lund, 1885 (Isopoda, Oniscidea) in Iran: redescription and intraspecific character variabilityAbstract In the present study, Hemilepistus elongatus Budde-Lund, 1885 is reported from Iran for the first time, redescribed and its diagnostic characters are figured. This species reveals a high variability in morphological characters. The division of the species at the subspecific level can not be supported anymore. This species differs from other species of the genus by the unique shape of male pleopod-endopodite I.
