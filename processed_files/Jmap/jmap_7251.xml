Age and growth of Astyanax eigenmanniorum (Cope) (Pisces, Characiformes) from San Roque Lake, ArgentinaThe age and growth of Astyanax eigenmanniorum from San Roque Lake (Province of CÃ³rdoba, Argentina) were studied. During two years, 3,086 specimens were analysed; these were collected monthly by means of a dragging net. Lepidologic studies were made to determine age and growth. Applying the traditional von Bertalanffy's model and Allen's method to length data, growth curves were drawn showing differences in both sexes; females having greater growth rate and asymtotic length than males. The relative condition factor and cephalic index show that during winter life conditions grow worse.
