Revision of the Lema (Lema) concinnipennis Baly, 1865 species group (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Criocerinae) in JapanThree species of the Lema (Lema) concinnipennis Baly, 1865 species group are found in Japan: L. concinnipennis Baly, 1865; L. cyanella (Linnaeus, 1758); and L. cirsicola Chûjô, 1959. Their apparent similarity causes confusion in identification. We have therefore revised their classification and provide the following taxonomic treatments: the syntypes of L. concinnipennis var. ventralis Kuwayama, 1932 have been identified as L. concinnipennis and L. cyanella, and the latter is designated the lectotype; L. inaequalicollis Pic, 1924 and L. concinnipennis var. ventralis are resurrected from synonymy with L. concinnipennis and newly synonymized under L. cyanella; we have found that L. cyanella ab. nigricans Jacobs, 1926 is an unavailable name, although the name had been accepted as available for a long time; L. sapporensis Matsumura, 1911 is resurrected from synonymy with L. cyanella. In addition, we provide a key to three species, diagnosis, and redescriptions for the three species.
