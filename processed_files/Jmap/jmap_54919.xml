Solid–solution equilibria of cadmium in soilsSeven cadmium (Cd)-treated soils (10 mg Cd kg−1 soil) with contrasting pH (4.9–8.4), organic matter content (0.1–1.8%) and mineralogy were used to investigate the role of solid-phase fractions on Cd solubility and equilibrium. The concentration of total dissolved Cd in soil solution (69.95–512 μg Cd l−1), dissolved organic C (58–750 mg C l−1), and estimated concentrations of free Cd2+ (0.1–16%) and Cd–organic complexes (82.1–99.9%) varied considerably amongst the soils. Organically bound Cd is a major component of soluble Cd in the soil solutions and this emphasizes the need to consider the complexes when speciating soluble Cd. Solid-phase fractionation of Cd together with correlation studies revealed that the dissolved concentrations of Cd can be predicted significantly (R2=0.98, P<0.001) using a multivariate model including pH and the amounts of Cd associated with organic binding sites. The data presented demonstrated the usefulness of the solid-phase fractionation in understanding the solid–solution equilibria of Cd in contaminated soils.
