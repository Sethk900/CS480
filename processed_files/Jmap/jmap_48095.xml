Moth floral visitors of the three rewarding Platanthera orchids revealed by interval photography with a digital cameraWe investigated the insect visitors of Platanthera ussuriensis, Platanthera sachalinensis and Platanthera florentii, which might contribute to pollination, using a digital camera with automatic interval photography. Monitoring was conducted for a total of five nights (45Â hours), and during every night, at least one moth species visited. The total number of pictures taken and pictures taken of moths were 3607 and 152, respectively. We concluded, based on our findings, that Geometridae and Noctuidae moths probably pollinated P.florentii and P.sachalinensis, respectively, whereas no pollinia attachment or removal was observed in P. ussuriensis during the intensive visit of the Crambidae moth.
