Carapace epibionts of loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) nesting at Canaveral National Seashore, FloridaA survey of the epibionts inhabiting the carapace of loggerhead sea turtles Caretta caretta (Linnaeus) nesting on Canaveral National Seashore, Florida was conducted from 2003â€“2004. Epibionts were sampled and identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible. Eleven newly documented epibiont species were observed from 52 individual loggerheads. We present the first records of sea urchins as loggerhead epibionts. Data are presented on the behavioural, physical, and ecological characteristics of some of these newly documented species to understand better the relationship between loggerhead turtles and their epibiota.
