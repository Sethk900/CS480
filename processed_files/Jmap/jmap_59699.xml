Hydraulic Performance of Aggregate Beds with Perforated Pipe Underdrains Flowing FullAbstractResults are presented from an experimental study of the stage discharge relationship for a porous pipe buried under loose laid aggregate. A series of steady-state experiments were performed in which the depth of flow over the pipe was measured for a given pipe discharge. The stage-discharge relationship for the entire system is well described by an orifice equation when the water surface in the aggregate trench was horizontal and the pipe was running full at the outlet. An energy equation analysis shows that the dominant energy losses are due to flow through the small side wall orifices into the pipe and from friction losses along the pipe. Friction losses in the aggregate are shown to be negligible, which again supports the orifice equation model. Discharge coefficients are reported for three commonly available porous pipes. The results of this research can be used in the sizing and placement of subsurface drains in aggregate filled storm water infiltration practices such as infiltration trenches and porous pavements.
