Some Suggested Guidelines for Geomorphic Aspects of Anadromous Salmonid Habitat Restoration ProposalsProposals to improve fish habitat for anadromous salmonids by modifying channel form or substrate must be justified based on geomorphology as well as biology, because geomorphic factors often cause such projects to fail. Proposals should address the geomor- phic setting at the watershed scale, by specifying changes in flow regime or sediment yield through tools such as a sediment budget. Proposals should also address geomorphic setting and process at the reach scale, indicating the basis for design channel form and dimensions, calculating the frequency of bed mobilization, and assessing existing gravel qual- ity for spawning habitat enhancement projects. Pro- posals should include explicit provisions for post- project performance evaluation, including adequate baseline data to permit project-induced changes to be quantified. Restoration projects also require clear ob- jectives and adequate funding for long-term monitor- ing, and generally would benefit from an adaptive man- agement approach to implementation and evaluation.
