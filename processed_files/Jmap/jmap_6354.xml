Evaluation of maize hybrids for kernel colonization by Fusarium moniliforme and F. subglutinansMaize kernels from six commercially grown hybrids were collected from various localities for three seasons. The incidence of kernel colonization by Fusarium moniliforme and F. subglutinans was determined by plating out 400 representative kernels per sample onto a Fusarium spp. selective medium. Regression analysis (Y = a + bX) was used to determine the relationship between the average incidence of infected kernels of all hybrids at a locality (X) and the observed disease incidence (Y) within a hybrid. Comparisons of the linear models of each hybrid combination indicated that maize hybrids did not differ significantly with regard to F moniliforme and F. subglutinans kernel infections.
