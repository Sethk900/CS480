The effect of particle-size distribution on the suitability of sandy soils for sports fieldsThe compaction of the topsoil layer of sports fields can modify soil properties such as permeability, resistance to root penetration, aeration and water-holding capacity. The feasibility of predicting these properties from particle size distribution parameters of sandy soils was investigated. With the exception of permeability which decreased with a decrease in sorting of particles, no significant correlation was found between particle-size distribution and the physical properties of 44 sand samples. It was concluded that either the selected particle size distribution parameters are not suitable for predicting the effects of compaction or that particle-size distribution as such cannot be related to the physical properties of compacted sands.
