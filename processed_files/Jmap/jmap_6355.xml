Allelopathic interaction between Chenopodium album L. and certain crop speciesLaboratory and glasshouse studies were conducted to assess the allelopathic effect of Chenopodium album L. on the germination and early growth of certain crop species. Test species were grown in soils containing 1% (m/m) freeze-dried shoot material of the weed. Aqueous extracts of soils containing weed residues and organic solvent extracts of shoots of the weed were tested for effects on the germination of certain crop species. Radish (Raphanus sativus L.) was the only crop not affected by the weed residue in the soil. Growth inhibition was 68% for cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), 85% for onion (Allium cepa L.), 47% for tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) and 51% for sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). Except for radish and sunflower, stand loss contributed to reductions in growth. Germination of crop species was not affected by aqueous extracts of soil portions (100g) from soil either grown with the weed (residues later removed by sieving) or containing shoot material of the weed. In fact, the growth of radicles of certain species was stimulated in the latter extract. The ethyl acetate, 100% and 50% methanol extractable fractions of C. album shoots inhibited germination of the single test plant (onion). The hexane extractable compounds slightly retarded germination. It is suggested that C. album contains allelochemicals which may inhibit seed germination and growth of certain crop seedlings.
