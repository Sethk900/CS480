Researching geoengineering: should not or could not?Is geoengineering a feasible, sensible, or practical stopgap measure for us to have in our arsenal of potential responses to global warming? We do not know at this point and so it seems hardly contentious to claim that we should find out. I evaluate a moral argument that we should not try to find out and a methodological argument that even if we try, we cannot find out. I reject the first but end up as agnostic on the second, outlining the burden of proof that it creates for proponents of geoengineering research.
