Shoot and root biomass of desert grasses as affected by biosolids applicationThis research evaluated the effects of level and season of biosolids application and irrigation regime on shoot and root biomass production of blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis (H.B.K.) Lag. ex Steud.) and tobosagrass (Hilaria mutica (Buckl.) Benth.), two perennial, warm season grasses of Chihuahuan Desert rangelands. Plants of both species were transplanted to pots and maintained under a rain-out shelter. The plants were treated either in the spring or summer with biosolids at levels of 0, 7, 18, 34, and 90 dry Mg ha(-1) and irrigated at 40% or 80% field capacity soil water content. In general, biosolids increased shoot biomass of both species, which was partly a result of the increased soil NO3-N concentrations that followed biosolids application. More biomass was allocated to the roots of the grasses when biosolids and irrigation levels were low. In contrast, more biomass was allocated to the shoots when biosolids and irrigation levels were high. Shoot biomass production and soil NO3-N concentrations were enhanced more by the spring application of biosolids than by the summer application. The season of application influences the beneficial effect of biosolids on desert grasses. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
