Body mass and water economy in the South American olivaceous field mouse along a latitudinal gradient: Implications for climate change.We compared geographic trends in body mass in a number of populations of the olivaceous field mouse (Abrothrix olivaceus,) along a latitudinal gradient in Chile, and tested the expected neutral tendency resulting from the opposite influences of environmental temperature and aridity across the gradient. Also, we studied water economy through physiological measurements of total evaporative water loss and urine osmolality in individuals from populations inhabiting two contrasting habitats (northern semiarid shrubland and southern temperate rainforest) and acclimated during six months to the same conditions. No change in male body mass with latitude was found across 39 populations. Evaporative water loss in rodents from the semiarid shrubland was significantly lower than that of individuals from the temperate rainforest, and urine osmolality was significantly higher in rodents from the semiarid habitat. We found a better tolerance of water shortage in the rodent population from the xeric habitat, thus suggesting the occurrence of local adaptation to the prevailing habitat conditions. The mechanisms by which rodents regulate their water economy in face of spatial and temporal fluctuations in environmental conditions constitute an essential component of the physiological flexibility that is necessary to cope with challenging climate change scenarios.
