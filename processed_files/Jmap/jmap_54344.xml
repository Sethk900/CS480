Submicroscopic model of fly ash particlesAlkaline fly ash produced from the combustion of western coal was chemically weathered and then examined for submicroscopic features and changes in bulk and trace element chemistry in order to develop a physical and chemical model of this waste material. Results of the study showed that elemental partitioning was heterogeneous and that solid glassy ash particles contained a reactive surface glass with accumulations of Ca, B, As, and other trace elements. Weathering of ash involved the dissolution of the surface glass coating and the concurrent release of minor and trace elements contained in the surface layer. Characteristics of the reactive surface layer are presented and submicroscopic features of thick-walled ash particles containing a network of mullite are included in the development of the model of ash particles.
