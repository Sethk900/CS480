Short-Lived Tree Species and Their Role as Indicators for Plant Diversity in the Restoration of Natural ForestsAnthropogenic forests, particularly conifer monocultures, today constitute a large proportion of Central European woodland. Conversion of such forest stands into abundantly structured mixed-species woodland is within the focus of ecosystem restoration and is considered to affect forest biodiversity. Short-lived tree species play an important role in such conversion processes and may serve as focal species. However, not much is known about their relationship with forest biodiversity. In this study, the short-lived tree species, European mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia L.), European white birch (Betula pendula Roth), Downy birch (B. pubescens Ehrh.), and Glossy buckthorn (Frangula alnus P. Mill.), commonly occurring throughout Central Europe, are investigated with regard to their relationship with plant diversity. The focus is on their occurrences in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)–dominated forests in the Northeast German lowlands. A significant increase in vascular plant diversity is revealed in stands with the selected species’ presence, in comparison to stands without them. Increase in plant species numbers is highest where the respective species occurs in the tree and/or shrub layer, compared with their presence only in the herb layer. For bryophyte species, there is a less strong inverse relationship. An analysis of different species groups, such as threatened, woody, and typical forest species of higher plants, reveals no decrease in species numbers in these groups if short-lived tree species are present. It is concluded that short-lived tree species can be indicators for plant diversity assessment within forest restoration processes. As to causal explanations, effects of differing site conditions, assessed by use of Ellenberg indicator values, are discussed as well as possible active effects of the tree species changing their environment.
