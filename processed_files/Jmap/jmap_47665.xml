Thanatosis in freshwater anomurans (Decapoda: Aeglidae)The present study evaluated the occurrence of thanatosis in freshwater crustaceans. The duration of the thanatosis events was compared with respect to photoperiod and size for Aegla longirostri (Brazil) and Aegla denticulata denticulata (Chile). Adults of A. longirostri did not show thanatosis; juveniles were responsive only when they were out of water. In the two species, thanatosis occurred in both light and dark photophases, and there was no significant difference in the duration of the events between the photophases. For A. d. denticulata, which lives in deep waters and in sympatry with larger decapods, this behaviour seems to represent an adaptation either to the environment or to the biotic community of the species. This behaviour is apparently not necessary for adults of A. longirostri, since this species is mainly nocturnal in its adult phase and its activity rhythms do not coincide with those of its potential predators.
