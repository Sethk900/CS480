Comparisons of the alpine bird communities across habitats and between autumn and winter in the midâ€Yalong Zangbo River valley, TibetThe extreme alpine environment around the midâ€Yalong Zangbo River on the Tibetan plateau supports a unique avifauna. To understand the structure and habitat selection of this poorly known bird assemblage, we quantified abundance of the birds in four representative types of vegetation and a human settlement inside a shrubâ€covered alpine valley (29Â°27â€²N, 91Â°40â€²E, 4000â€“5200Â m a.s.l.) in the Lhasa mountains, Tibet, from September 2004 to January 2005. A total of 40 species of birds was recorded, six of which were summer breeders, one vagrant autumn migrant, 29 permanent residents, and four local wintering migrants. Latitudinally migrating taxa were absent. Of the 33 wintering species, 70% were alpine specialists. Patterns of distribution of species and individuals differed across habitats. The highest bird species richness was found in Roseâ€“Barberry shrub where vegetation was most complex, and fruiting and seeding plants abundant. From autumn to winter, birds tended to aggregate in the human settlement for foods supplemented by local Buddhists; as a consequence this habitat contained the highest individual density. In terms of trophic guilds, plantâ€eating birds were predominant in composition (65.8â€“75.8%) and numerically abundant (89.8â€“96.7%) in all the habitats. We concluded that vegetation diversity and food supply significantly influence species composition and individual abundance of the alpine bird community. For longâ€term survival of the unique bird assemblage, we argue for protection of the shrub vegetation as it is difficult to regenerate in the harsh highâ€altitude conditions.
