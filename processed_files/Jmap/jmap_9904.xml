Assemblages of U.S. West Coast Estuaries Based on the Distribution of FishesPrincipal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on a data matrix representing presence or absence of 360 adult and juvenile fish species in twenty-eight estuaries ranging from Puget Sound. WA to Tijuana, CA. The data matrix included published and unpublished information for each species/estuary combination and consultation with local fishery experts on specific estuaries. The PCA identified six estuarine components that explained 72% of the variation in the data: (1) Northern Riverine Group; (2) Southern California Group; (3) Northern Estuarine Group; (4) Central Marine Group; (5) Fjord Group; and (6) Coastal Northwest Group. Species assemblages for each estuarine group were identified and used as surrogate habitat indicators to compare and contrast groups of estuaries. Stepwise multiple regressions of estuarine physical characteristics identified estuary mouth depth and area of the seawater zone as significant predictors of the number of fish species per estuary. These estuarine physical parameters appear to influence access and diversity of estuarine habitats and ultimately the number of fish species occurring within an estuary.
