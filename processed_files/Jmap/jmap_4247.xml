New species of Ichthyocladius Fittkau, a Member of the Corynoneura-Group (Diptera: Chironomidae: Orthocladiinae), with a Review of the GenusEmended diagnoses of all stages of the genus Ichthyocladius Fittkau are given. The genus appears to be a basal member of the Corynoneura group showing affinities also to the Eukiefferiella group. A number of features apparently are the result of the phoretic life on catfishes. Ichthyocladius kronichticola sp. n. and I. lilianae sp. n. are described and figured in all stages. Additional pupae from the Amazonas in Brazil and from the Parque Nacional Iguaz√∫ in Argentina are also described and figured. Keys to pupae and larvae of the genus are given.
