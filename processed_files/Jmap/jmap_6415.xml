Nutrient inflow to the roots of irrigated wheat throughout the growing season under semi-arid climatic conditionsThe objective of this study was to obtain information on the inflow of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn to the roots of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown under normal irrigation farming conditions. Except for irrigation scheduling, the eight farmers on whose farms the study was conducted were allowed to follow their normal farming practices. At each site biomass production, nutrient content of the top growth and root length were measured regularly throughout the growing season, starting 35–45 days after planting. The inflow of all ten nutrients increased with the age of the crop, reaching a maximum somewhere between four fully unfolded leaves and anthesis, whereafter it decreased. The maximum inflow values for N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S were respectively, 113.0, 17.7, 187.0, 17.1, 8.9 and 8.3 μg m−1day−1. In the case of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn the maximum inflow values were 46.4, 1 493.4, 249.8 and 68.3 ng m−1day−1 respectively. In the period when maximum inflow occurs, namely, 70–110 days after planting, the nutrient supply capacity of the irrigated soils will be exploited to the utmost due to a limited root length. It seems that under local circumstances a root length of only 4–5 km m−2 is sufficient for adequate nutrient absorption during peak inflow, providing the water regime of the soils is kept at field capacity.
