Demersal faunal assemblages in the deep waters of the eastern Ionian SeaData were collected during an exploratory trawl survey in the deep waters (300–900 m) of the southern part of the Greek Ionian Sea. A multivariate analysis of the abundance of the species in the various stations revealed the existence of two main distinct groups corresponding to the depth zones 300–500 m and 500–900 m. A secondary separation between the stations of the zone 500–700 m and those of the zone 700–900 m was observed. In the shallowest zone, the dominant species was Chlorophthalmus agassizii followed by Plesionika edwardsii, Hymenocephalus italicus, Argentina sphyraena and Plesionika antigai. In the depth stratum 500–700 m, the most abundant species were Aristaeomorpha foliacea, Plesionika martia, Chlorophthalmus agassizii and Hoplostethus mediterraneus. The most abundant species in the depth stratum 700–900 m were the red shrimps Aristaeomorpha foliacea and Aristeus antennatus. The results of the assemblage composition are compared to those of other relevant areas and are discussed considering the fishing intensity and environmental conditions.
