Recognition of sedimentary characteristics in soils by size-shape analysisSize-shape analysis has been applied to two soils of alluvial origin and to an in-situ soil over granite. Elongation function curves for the granitic soil show that its quartz grains become increasingly equant with increasing size. The coarser particles of the alluvial soils, by contrast, become less equant and more elongated with increasing grain size â€” a characteristic of the framework population of bed-load sediments.  The method appears promising for helping to distinguish transported from in-situ parent materials.
