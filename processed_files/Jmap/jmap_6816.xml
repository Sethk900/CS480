A complex dormancy mechanism in seeds of the weed Rubus cuneifoliusBoth the endocarp and embryo contribute to the dormancy of Rubus cuneifolius seed. Whereas scarification was found to break the dormancy imposed by the endocarp, embryo dormancy could only be overcome by a combination of treatments. These treatments consisted of a one-month stratification period followed by incubation at an alternating temperature ot 10–20 °C in the presence of light. S. Afr. J. Plant Soil 1984, 1: 48–50
