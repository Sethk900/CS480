Meldrum’s AcidMeldrum"s acid (1, isopropylidene malonate or 2,2-di­methyl-4,6-dioxo-1,3-dioxane), was first synthesized by Meldrum in 1908 [1] and the structure was incorrectly assigned as the b-lactone of b-hydroxyisopropylmalonic acid (b,b-dimethyl-b-propiolactone-a-carboxylic acid). [2] It was only 40 years later that Davidson and Bernhard assigned the correct structure. [2] Meldrum’s acid has attracted considerable attention due to its high acidity (pK a = 4.97) [3] and rigid cyclic structure. Acylated derivatives (synthetic equivalents of mixed ketenes) readily undergo alcoholysis to give b-keto esters. [4] Alkylidene derivatives are strong electrophiles and can undergo Diels-Alder reactions with high diasteroselectivity. [5] This versatile tool is a key intermediate for a large number of important building blocks and there remains much to discover.
