A new species of Newportia Gervais, 1847 from Puerto Rico, with a revised key to the species of the genus (Chilopoda, Scolopendromorpha, Scolopocryptopidae)Abstract A new species of the centipede genus Newportia, Newportia stoevi sp. n., is described from Rio Encantado Cave, Puerto Rico. It differs from all congeners by having sternites distinctly margined laterally and ultimate legs bearing 4 spinous processes on both prefemur and femur, and 2 on tibia. The value of some terms used in the taxonomy of the genus have been analyzed and an amended identification key to the species of Newportia is provided.
