Effects of thinning, liming and litter layer treatments on soil CO2 efflux and litter decay in Pinus rigida and Larix leptolepis plantations.Soil CO2 efflux, soil temperature at the 10cm depth, and litter decay rates were measured in 40-year-old Pinus rigida Mill. and 36-year-old Larix leptolepis Gordon plantations in central Korea with the treatments of thinning (T, 50% thinning), liming (L, Ca+Mg, 2ton/ha), and litter layer (litter removal (LR), no treatment (NT), double litter layer (DL)). Soil CO2 efflux of both plantations was strongly dependent on soil temperature that varied with the treatments. The average soil CO2 efflux was highest at the thinning plot of P. rigida (0.69g CO2/m2/h) and lowest at the control plot of L. leptolepis (0.28g CO2/m2/h). Only the liming treatment increased average soil CO2 efflux in the L. leptolepis plantation. The best-fit equation in the control plot had soil CO2 efflux (y) increasing exponentially with soil temperature (x):y=0.0119e0.2051x (R2=0.86) in the P. rigida plantation and y=0.0016e0.2734x (R2=0.83) in the L. leptolepis plantation. Litter decay rates were lowest in LR plots of two plantations and affected more largely by the treatment of litter layer than by thinning and liming. The results showed fundamental information about carbon cycling in forest ecosystems and can be used to estimate total CO2 efflux from soils during a year.
