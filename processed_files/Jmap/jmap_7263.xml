Synopsis of the land mollusca of ChileAbout 150 species belonging to 14 families are mentioned in the scattered literature dealing with the land molluscs of Chile. However, the records of the Streptaxidae and Haplotrematidae are dubious and all those for the Limacidae, Zonitidae and Helicidae correspond to introduced species. The remaining 9 families are represented by endemic genera and subgenera present either in the oceanic islands (Fernandezia, Tornatellina, Ambrosiella) or in continental Chile (Bostryx (Ataxus), Chiliborus). A few are limited in their distribution to the southern part of South America (Austrodiscus, Stephadiscus, Macrocyclis) or are found both in the islands and along the continent (Amphiodoxa, Stephanoda). The majority of the other genera have a wider distribution in the Indoâ€Pacific (Punctum, Ptychodon, Champa), in South America, the Americas in general and/or in the other parts of the world. The distribution of molluscan genera and species in continental Chile is discussed with regard to the biogeographic units proposed by various authors for plants and animals. Their probable relationships with the faunas of neighbouring countries and other biogeographic regions is briefly outlined. A taxonomic list of the species indicating the original reference, general distribution and the uncertain position of some of them within the different genera is given. Only about 120 species appear relatively well characterized.
