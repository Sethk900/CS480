Bat Species Composition in Three Localities in the Amazon BasinWe compared the bat species composition of three localities in the Brazilian Amazon: continuous forest and fragments at Alter do Chão, Santarém, an area not previously sampled, and continuous forest in two relatively well studied areas, Manaus and Belém. The number of species captured at each locality varied between 17 and 42. Most species occurred at high abundance in continuous forest in the three localities, but only a subset was common in the fragments at Santarém. The relative abundance of bat species in Santarém is different from other localities sampled in the Amazon Basin and the presence of forest fragments may be the most important factor contributing to this difference. Multidi-mensional scaling ordination of sites based on relative abundance indicated distinct assemblages of bat species in the forest fragments in Santarém, and little differentiation of continuous-forest sites from sites in other localities. Continuous forests at Santarém and near Belém were more similar to each other than to continuous forest near Manaus, indicating the possibility of an east-west gradient in bat communities in the Amazon.
