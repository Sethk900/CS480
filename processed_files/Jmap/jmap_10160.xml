The Mark of Zorro: Effects of the Exotic Annual Grass Vulpia myuros on California Native Perennial GrassesNative perennial grasses were once common in California prairies that\nare now dominated by annual grasses introduced from Europe. Competition\nfrom exotics may be a principal impediment to reestablishment of\nnative perennial grasses. Introduced annual grasses, such as Vulpia\nmyuros (zorro fescue), are often included with native perennial species\nin revegetation seed mixtures used in California. To examine the\npotential suppressive effect of this graminoid, we evaluated the\ngrowth and performance of a mixture of California native perennial\ngrasses and resident weeds when grown with varying densities of V.\nmyuros. The annual fescue exhibited a strongly plastic growth response\nto plant density, producing similar amounts of above-ground biomass\nat all seeding densities. Perennial grass seedling survival and above-\nground biomass decreased and individuals became thinner (i.e., reduced\nweight-to-height ratio) with increasing V. myuros seeding density.\nV. myuros also significantly suppressed above-ground biomass and\ndensities of weeds and had a more negative effect on weed densities\nthan on native perennial grass densities. Biomass of native grasses\nand weeds was not differentially affected by increasing densities\nof V. myuros. Overall, because V. myuros significantly reduced the\nsurvival and performance of the mixture of native perennial grasses\nand this effect increased with increasing V. myuros density, we conclude\nthat including this exotic annual in native seed mixtures is counterproductive\nto restoration efforts.
