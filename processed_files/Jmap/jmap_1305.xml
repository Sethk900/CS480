CARCASS COMPOSITION AND ENERGY RESERVES OF SAGE GROUSE DURING WINTERCarcass composition of Sage Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) was measured to assess the size and variation of energy reserves during winter in North Park, Colorado. Fat content ranged from 0.8 to 8.4%. Adults had higher (P=0.001) fat content than yearlings (4.7 v. 2.9%); birds collected in 1982 had more (P<0.05) fat than birds collected in 1981. Estimated fat content was higher (P<0.05) when diethyl ether, rather than petroleum ether, was used as a solvent (4.0 v. 3.6%). Fat comprised 85 to 93% of estimated energy reserves which equaled 9.6, 5.1, 7.0, and 5.3 times standard metabolic rate for adult and yearling males and adult and yearling females, respectively. All age and sex classes gained or maintained weight and fat over winter. Relatively small energy reserves of Sage Grouse are probably most important during breeding and nesting activities.
