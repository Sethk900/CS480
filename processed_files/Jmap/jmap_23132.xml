GenSeq: An updated nomenclature and ranking for genetic sequences from type and non-type sourcesAbstract An improved and expanded nomenclature for genetic sequences is introduced that corresponds with a ranking of the reliability of the taxonomic identification of the source specimens. This nomenclature is an advancement of the â€œGenetypesâ€ naming system, which some have been reluctant to adopt because of the use of the â€œtypeâ€ suffix in the terminology. In the new nomenclature, genetic sequences are labeled â€œgenseq,â€ followed by a reliability ranking (e.g., 1 if the sequence is from a primary type), followed by the name of the genes from which the sequences were derived (e.g., genseq-1 16S, COI). The numbered suffix provides an indication of the likely reliability of taxonomic identification of the voucher. Included in this ranking system, in descending order of taxonomic reliability, are the following: sequences from primary types â€“ â€œgenseq-1,â€ secondary types â€“ â€œgenseq-2,â€ collection-vouchered topotypes â€“ â€œgenseq-3,â€ collection-vouchered non-types â€“ â€œgenseq-4,â€ and non-types that lack specimen vouchers but have photo vouchers â€“ â€œgenseq-5.â€ To demonstrate use of the new nomenclature, we review recently published new-species descriptions in the ichthyological literature that include DNA data and apply the GenSeq nomenclature to sequences referenced in those publications. We encourage authors to adopt the GenSeq nomenclature (note capital â€œGâ€ and â€œSâ€ when referring to the nomenclatural program) to provide a searchable tag (e.g., â€œgenseqâ€; note lowercase â€œgâ€ and â€œsâ€ when referring to sequences) for genetic sequences from types and other vouchered specimens. Use of the new nomenclature and ranking system will improve integration of molecular phylogenetics and biological taxonomy and enhance the ability of researchers to assess the reliability of sequence data. We further encourage authors to update sequence information on databases such as GenBank whenever nomenclatural changes are made.
