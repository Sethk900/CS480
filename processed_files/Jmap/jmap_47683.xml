Sliding Rocks on Racetrack Playa, Death Valley National Park: First Observation of Rocks in MotionThe engraved trails of rocks on the nearly flat, dry mud surface of Racetrack Playa, Death Valley National Park, have excited speculation about the movement mechanism since the 1940s. Rock movement has been variously attributed to high winds, liquid water, ice, or ice flotation, but has not been previously observed in action. We recorded the first direct scientific observation of rock movements using GPS-instrumented rocks and photography, in conjunction with a weather station and time-lapse cameras. The largest observed rock movement involved >60 rocks on December 20, 2013 and some instrumented rocks moved up to 224 m between December 2013 and January 2014 in multiple move events. In contrast with previous hypotheses of powerful winds or thick ice floating rocks off the playa surface, the process of rock movement that we have observed occurs when the thin, 3 to 6 mm, â€œwindowpaneâ€ ice sheet covering the playa pool begins to melt in late morning sun and breaks up under light winds of ~4â€“5 m/s. Floating ice panels 10 s of meters in size push multiple rocks at low speeds of 2â€“5 m/min. along trajectories determined by the direction and velocity of the wind as well as that of the water flowing under the ice.
