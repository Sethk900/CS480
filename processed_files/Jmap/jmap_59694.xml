Laboratory Scale Study to Quantify the Effect of Sediment Accumulation on the Hydraulic Conductivity of Pervious ConcreteAbstractPervious concrete systems can reduce storm water runoff, minimize non-point-source pollution, and increase groundwater recharge. However, pervious concrete has the potential to clog, reducing its infiltration rate enough to eliminate these benefits. Pervious concrete clogs when sediment builds up at the surface or within the pervious concrete void matrix, blocking the flow path through the void matrix, thus reducing the infiltration rate. This study measured the effect of sediment accumulation on the hydraulic conductivity of pervious concrete. The resulting data were used to develop a model that predicts the hydraulic conductivity of pervious concrete based on the initial hydraulic conductivity and the amount and type of accumulated sediment.
