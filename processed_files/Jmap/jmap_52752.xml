Status of selenium in sheep and dairy cow blood in Western Balkan countriesThe main goal of the study was to assess the selenium (Se) status of sheep and cows in some of the Western Balkan countries. A total number of 105 sheep and 160 cow blood samples (from 21 and 39 farms, respectively) were collected and analyzed for Se in the whole blood (WB). Samples have been analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The results showed that 85.6% of sheep and 45.6% of cows had inadequate (â‰¤100 ng/mL) level of WB-Se concentration. The WB-Se concentration was significantly higher in both Se supplemented sheep and cows than in those without any Se supplementation. The WB-Se concentration was inadequate at all farms without Se supplementation. Therefore, Se should be supplemented to the animal feed or Se-biofortified feed used to ensure adequate level of Se in cows and sheep in all the Balkan countries.
