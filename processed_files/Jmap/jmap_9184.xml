A potential compound for sand fixation synthesized from the effluent of pulp and paper millsThe effluent from a Chinese paper mill (pH 7.1) was concentrated, and the solid residue was dried and ground. Crude lignosulfonate was obtained as a brown powder, and a novel sand-fixation agent was synthesized by means of graft copolymerization of the lignosulfonate with acrylic acid and formaldehyde. The newly synthesized product had good water solubility, potentially good biodegradation, and produced no additional pollution. The crusts formed on shifting sands using this agent had higher crushing strength and better resistance to wind erosion than those produced with two other recently patented fixatives.
