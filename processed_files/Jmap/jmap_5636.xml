Novel trophobiotic interactions in lantern bugs (Insecta: Auchenorrhyncha: Fulgoridae)Lantern bugs (Fulgoridae) are large (often >35Â mm), phloemâ€feeding insects, most diverse in humid tropical forests. They produce copious amounts of honeydew, which they forcefully eject far from their bodies, and, to date, no organisms have been known to be able to feed on it directly. Here we document a widespread occurrence of direct feeding on lantern bugs' honeydew by other organisms, including snails, to our knowledge the first case of gastropodâ€“insect trophobiosis.
