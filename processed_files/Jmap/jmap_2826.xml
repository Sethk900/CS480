Population dynamics of the cactus Mammillaria gaumeri: an integral projection model approachThe Cactaceae family in Mexico is particularly important because members of this family exhibit a high degree of endemism. Unfortunately, many species of the Cactaceae are threatened or endangered. We employed an integral projection model for studies of the population dynamics of Mammillaria gaumeri, an endemic cactus of the Yucatan characterized by a small population size. The integral projection model provides estimates of the asymptotic growth rate, stable size distribution, reproductive values, and sensitivities and elasticities of the growth rate to changes in vital rates. Nine locations of this species were studied along the Yucatan coast over a 9-year period. Individuals were classified by plant volume. Most population growth rate (lambda) values were below unity. The highest elasticity values corresponded to the survival of intermediate size individuals. The percentage of germination in the field was low, and consequently, fecundity values were also low. Reproductive values were observed to increase with plant volume. The stable size distribution of M. gaumeri was skewed toward small individuals. For all years, the kernel showed that individual survival determined the population growth rate.
