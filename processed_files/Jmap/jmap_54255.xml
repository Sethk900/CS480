A â€˜Geo-Pedo-Fingerprintâ€™ (GPF) as a tracer to detect univocal parent material-to-wine production chain in high quality vineyard districts, Campi Flegrei (Southern Italy)An interdisciplinary study, involving geologists, chemists and pedologists, started aiming at identifying a â€œGeo-Pedo-Fingerprintâ€ (GPF) univocally linking the wine to its origin, namely, the Piedirosso vineyards growing in the Campi Flegrei volcanic area. The focal point of this research was the characterization of the whole parent materialâ€“soilâ€“vineyardâ€“wine system, achieved by correlating the elemental pattern â€“ with special reference to micro-nutrients and Rare Earth Elements (REEs) â€“ and Sr isotopic ratios, to identify a reliable and convenient â€˜GPFâ€˜, as a guaranteed indicator of wine provenance. A representative soil/Piedirosso vineyard system was identified and characterized. Samples from each soil horizon as well as from vine branches, leaves, grapes and wine were collected and analyzed. All samples were analyzed by multi-collector inductively coupled mass spectrometry (MC-ICPMS) to determine their 87Sr/86Sr isotopic composition, by ICP-Quadrupole MS to measure multi-elemental composition including REE, and by X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD) for the quantitative evaluation of the mineral phases occurring in soil samples.
