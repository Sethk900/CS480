Carbon and nitrogen dynamics of pre- and post-fire chaparral exposed to varying atmospheric N deposition.Fire and atmospheric N deposition have the capacity to alter the N and C cycling and storage of semi-arid shrublands. Thus, we measured the pre- and post-fire soil and tissue C and N dynamics of three southern California chaparral stands exposed to varying levels of N deposition. Total soil N was positively correlated with N deposition exposure before and after fire, indicating that fire did little to alter patterns of soil N enrichment from atmospheric N deposition. Fire caused a significant increase in soil extractable N, and this increase was positively correlated with N deposition indicating that fire enhanced soil N availability more at sites exposed to high N deposition. Fire also caused the tissue N concentration of regenerating Adenostoma fasciculatum (chamise) shrubs to be significantly correlated with N deposition; however, the correlation was negative during the first year of fire recovery (r2=0.62) and positive during the second (r2=0.94) indicating complex and transient dynamics in shrub growth and N concentration. Overall, our results suggest that periodic fire in chaparral may not reduce the potential for N enrichment that develops over decades of N deposition and have important implications for the propensity of these semi-arid shrublands to become "N-saturated".
