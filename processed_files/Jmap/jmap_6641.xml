Rapid vegetative propagation of pineapples by crown sectioningPineapples can be rapidly multiplied and propagated by means of crown sections in a peatmoss and vermiculite mixture (2:1). Each section can produce a new plantlet within 65 days and the development of dormant buds may be promoted by the removal of the daughter plant. Crown expiants could produce daughter plants under glasshouse or ambient conditions.
