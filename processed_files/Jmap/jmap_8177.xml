The landscape of ecologyScience, and ecology, is fundamentally a social endeavor. As such, central aspects of the scientific process, like innovation or the exchange of ideas, can be influenced by the geographic distribution of scientists and resources. Nonetheless, the spatial patterning of ecological research within the United States has never been measured. By using an approach similar to that used to map global biodiversity hotspots, we quantified ecological research activity across the United States. We assigned members of Ecological Society of America, recipients of National Science Foundation grants, and authors of publications in leading ecological journals to the ZIP code of their home institution. Using these data we mapped the density of ecologists, and the magnitude of their inputs and outputs, and quantified an â€œecological activityâ€ index to measure the spatial intensity of ecological research within the United States. We also examined spatial patterns of collaboration. Our quantification of ecological activity and subsequent cluster analysis revealed distinct centers, or hotspots, of ecological research. Our analyses also indicated that such hotspots of ecological activity achieved their status via different pathways. Furthermore, ecologists within hotspots of ecological research were highly connected via collaborations with researchers across the country and within their own ZIP code.
