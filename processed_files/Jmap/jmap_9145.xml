Polyfluorenes with on-chain dibenzoborole unitsâ€”Synthesis and anion-induced photoluminescence quenchingThe photoluminescence response of a novel, random 9,9-dialkylfluorene/dibenzoborole copolymer toward a series of nine inorganic anions was studied both in solution and in thin films. Photoluminescence quenching with sensitivity in the micromolar range was observed for fluoride, cyanide, and iodide. Hereby, the interaction of the copolymer with fluoride/cyanide or iodide follows different quenching mechanisms. Such copolymers are promising solid-state anion sensors.
