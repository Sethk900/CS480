Tardigrades from the Tsinling Mountains, central China with descriptions of two new species of Echiniscidae (Tardigrada)A checklist of 63 species of tardigrades from the Tsinling Mountains is given in this paper. Thirty‚Äseven species of tardigrades that had never been found in the Tsinling Mountains were reported here. Twenty of them are new records for the mountains, 15 of them are new records for China, two of them are new to science. Pseudechiniscus pilatoi sp. n. is similar to Pseudechiniscus quadrilobatus Iharos, 1969. It differs from P. quadrilobatus in different cuticular sculpture, in the joints of paired‚Äplates, near the dorsal median line, uplifting but not protruding backward, and in lacking notches on terminal plate. Echiniscus marleyi sp. n. differs from E. canadensis Murray in having filaments D; it differs from E. mediantus Marcus in lacking filaments C but in having filaments D; it differs from E. spinulosus (Doy√®re) in lacking teeth B, C, E, and in having filaments D instead of teeth D.
