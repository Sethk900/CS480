A Remote Videography System for Monitoring Beavers.We developed a remote videography system for monitoring behavior and demography of beavers (<em>Castor canadensis</em>) inside lodges and bank dens. Videography systems taped 6 beaver colonies for 1,080 hours and recorded 300 hours of beaver activity. Upon viewing videotape, we could characterize 86% of beaver activity into 1 of 12 behavioral categories. Of 26 individually marked beavers, we observed 8 (31%) on videotape and obtained a complete count of kits in 4 of 5 colonies. The remote videography system was generally useful and can provide wildlife biologists with demographic and behavioral information to support population modeling and management programs for beavers.
