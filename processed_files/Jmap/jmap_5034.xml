Butterflies (Lepidoptera: Papilionoidea) of Mount Kilimanjaro: introduction and family PapilionidaeThis article marks the beginning of a short series on the butterfly fauna of Mount Kilimanjaro. It commences with a brief overview of the topography, tectonic history, climate, ecological zonation and conservation significance of Africa's highest mountain. Following an introductory account to the butterfly fauna, the rest of this paper presents an annotated checklist of the swallowtails (Papilionidae). Eight papilionid species are currently believed to occur within the main forest zone, from 1800 to 2800 m (in places this zone extends down to c.1600 m). Another 10 have been recorded from the lower slopes, which include some disturbed forest and forest relicts, from 700–1800 m. The need for better data is discussed in light of the suggestion that the butterflies of Mount Kilimanjaro could become a focal group for monitoring effects of climate change. An identification key to families, together with a key to the swallowtail species and colour illustrations of adults, are included as online Supplementary Information.
