Woody Encroachment Removal from Midwestern Oak Savannas Alters Understory Diversity across Space and Time.Recovering biodiversity is a common goal during restoration; however, for many ecosystems, it is not well understood how restoration influences species diversity across space and time. I examined understory species diversity and composition after woody encroachment removal in a large-scale savanna restoration experiment in central Iowa, United States. Over a 4-year time series, restoration had profound effects across space and time, increasing richness at local and site-level scales. Restoration sites had increased &alpha; (within sample) Simpson's diversity and &alpha; and &gamma; (site level) species richness relative to control sites, although &gamma; and &beta; (among sample) Simpson's diversity, &beta; richness, and &alpha; species evenness were not affected. Changes in richness were driven by graminoids at the &alpha; and &gamma; scales and woody species (and some evidence for forbs) at the &alpha; scale. Interestingly, indicator species analysis revealed that at least some species from all functional groups were promoted by restoration, although no species were significant indicators of pre-treatment or control sites. Both savanna and nonsavanna species were indicators of restored sites. Restoration promoted exotic species at both scales, although species with spring phenologies were unaffected. Woody encroachment removal may be a means to promote species establishment in savannas; however, in this study, it resulted in establishment and proliferation of native and exotic and savanna and nonsavanna species. Future work might consider reintroduction of key savanna species to supplement those that have established. Work like this demonstrates the utility of restoration experiments for conducting research on large- and multiscale processes, such as species diversity.
