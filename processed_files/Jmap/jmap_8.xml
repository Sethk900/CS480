Relationship between evapotranspiration and precipitation pulses in a semiarid rangeland estimated by moisture flux towers and MODIS vegetation indices.The phenology of three dominant and economically important tree species; Acacia erioloba, Acacia luederitzii and Acacia mellifera, all widespread in the Kalahari in Botswana, was studied at Tsabong (25째56.65'S, 22째27.72'E) and Maun (20째09.60'S, 23째46.63'E) receiving 300 and 463 mm annual rainfall, respectively. The main aims were to investigate how possible environmental cues influence timing and development of phenophases and whether different tree species have different seasonal responses to these cues. Likely effects of climatic changes on phenological development patterns were also considered.
