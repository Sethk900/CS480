Long-term effects of a wildfire on a lizard assemblage in the Arid Chaco forest.The long-term (14 years) effects of a high-intensity wildfire on a lizard assemblage were studied in Chancani Provincial Natural Park and Forest Natural Reserve (Cordoba, Argentina), by comparing a burned area with an unburned one within the protected area. Lizard diversity and abundance were measured using 25 drift-fence pitfall traps in the burned area and in a portion of the unburned forest during two summers (2006-2007 and 2007-2008). A total of 426 lizards belonging to eight species were captured. Total captures were 40% higher in the unburned area than in the burned one. From the eight species recorded, five (Homonota fasciata, Leiosaurus paronae, Stenocercus doellojuradoi, Liolaemus chacoensis, and Teius teyou) were more abundant in the unburned area, whereas the remaining species (Tropidurus etheridgei, Mabuya dorsivittata and Vanzosaura rubricauda) did not differ between areas. The differences observed in lizard numbers between sites may be related to fire-driven changes. A marked increase in grass cover determining the reduced availability of bare and litter-covered ground, fallen logs and dead wood, favorite microhabitats for most lizard species, is of particular significance.
