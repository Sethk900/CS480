Spatiotemporal evolution of a unique preserved meandering system in Central Europe — The Morava River near LitovelRivers are naturally dynamic over time and space and respond to the variability of water and sediment inputs and to anthropogenic pressures that cause changes to the river's behaviour and form. This study describes the evolution of part of the Morava River and the Kenický meander in the Litovelské Pomoraví protected area near the city of Olomouc. The research describes the historical development of the study area using aerial photos, UAV images and geodetic measurements. Long-term measurements and imaging using UAV technologies have allowed a large amount of information to be collected. This information was used to study the Kenický meander and the Morava River. Significant lateral channel changes in the banks have occurred in the past and generated the Kenický meander. A significant event occurred in the spring of 2012, when high water levels were caused a rupture of a meander-natural cutoff. The water level was monitored in the Kenický wood accumulation, which formed in the Kenický meander, before and after the rupture. Monitoring the movement of wood in the river basin is particularly important because the movement of ice in the winter can cause blockage of the channel and subsequent flooding of water over the banks and into the surrounding communities.
