Estimation of Concentration and Load of Suspended Bed Sediment in a Large River by Means of Acoustic Doppler TechnologyAbstractThe standard experimental methods used for sampling suspended loads in large rivers are usually time consuming, unsafe, rather expensive, and have a limited spatial resolution. Acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs), usually applied to measure the flow discharge, may also be used to assess the suspended sediment concentration by analyzing the backscattering acoustic strength. Though important efforts have been dedicated to test this method, results are not as reliable as engineering practices require, especially in large fluvial systems. In this paper, the correlation between the corrected backscatter from a 1,200 kHz ADCP and the suspended concentration from a depth-integrated sampler is presented and discussed. Despite the assumptions required to utilize this method (i.e., monosized grain and homogeneous vertical concentration), the results showed acceptable differences when they were compared with traditional methods. An evaluation of the backscatter and attenuation of sound produced by fine and coarse material is presented. Finally, the total suspended load of bed sediment is assessed using moving-boat ADCP measurements and compared with results from the corresponding standard method. Differences are at most 46%.
