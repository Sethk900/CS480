Sage-Grouse and Coal-Bed Methane: Can They Coexist within the Powder River Basin?Concerns are growing regarding the availability of sustainable energy sources due to a rapidly growing human population and a better understanding of climate change. In recent years, the United States has focused much attention on developing domestic energy sources, which include coal-bed methane (CBM). There are vast deposits of the natural gas within the Powder River Basin (PRB), Wyoming. A sharp increase in exploration and development of CBM in the region has led to a decline in the surrounding greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) populations in developed areas. This case study presents the issues surrounding CBM development and sage-grouse conservation within the PRB and provides instructors with online resources and classroom activities that can be used to stimulate and develop students' active learning and critical thinking skills.
