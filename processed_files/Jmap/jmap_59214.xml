Relationship between Urban Runoff Pollutant and Catchment CharacteristicsAbstractMuch research has been done to determine levels of contamination in runoff from urban and rural catchment areas. Some authors compare their results with other authors or look for relationships between the variations of pollutant concentration and the catchment characteristics, but they seldom focus on determining the statistical significance of their results. This paper presents a review of 37 papers selected from a total of 169 papers consulted about runoff-water quality throughout the world (America, Asia, and Europe). The results presented in these 37 papers have been reviewed and statistically analyzed to evaluate the influence of catchment-area characteristics (location, size, average daily traffic, and type of land use) on the storm water runoff pollution. For the cases studied, most of the results about the polluting agents studied are comparable and no important element of the catchment characteristics had significant influence on the pollutantsâ€™ concentration.
