Nassella pulchra Survival and Water Relations Depend More on Site Productivity Than on Small-Scale Disturbance.We found no significant effect (<em>p</em> > 0.38) of clipping surrounding non-native annuals on the performance or survival of plantings of the native <em>Nassella pulchra</em>. However, the preplanting productivity of the three sites had a significant effect (<em>p</em> < 0.001) on the demography and water relations of <em>Nassella</em>. Survival was 85% on the lowest productivity site and it decreased by 6% for each additional 100 kg in average aboveground productivity between 2,400 and 3,600 kg/ha. Plants experienced greater water stress in higher productivity sites. Together, these results suggest that the original habitat of <em>N. pulchra</em> may have been in more marginal ecological sites rather than the more fertile soils of the Central Valley.
