Continuous Measurement of Carbon Dioxide Evolution From Partitioned Forest Floor ComponentsLoss rates of organic detritus in ecosystems can be determined by measuring rates of CO2 release from decomposing organic substrates. We used an open system employing inverted boxes and an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) to obtain continuous measurements of CO2 evolution from the floor of a mixed mesophytic forest. Plexiglass sheets were used to partition respiratory activity of two litter horizons (01 and 02) and soil. Root respiration rates were determined with a differential respirometer. We compared the open system with a closed system in which KOH was used as the CO2 absorber. Respiration measurements with KOH were 63% of IRGA values at 20'C and 90% at 12'C. Flow rates (28 to 340 liters hr-1) had no effect on rates of CO2 evolution. Nighttime CO2 evolution rates were generally higher than daytime rates. Seasonal CO2 evolution ranged from 2.8 g m-2 day-' to 26.3 g m-2 day-1. Preliminary data indicate annual C02 evolution of 3.8 kg mi-2 (48% from litter, 17% from soil, and 35% from roots). This estimate is equivalent to 2.3 kg m-2 organic mass catabolized, assuming a carbohydrate substrate, which is 11 % higher than independent esti- mates of the organic detritus annually available for catabolism.
