A new species of Paramunida Baba, 1988 from the Central Pacific Ocean and a new genus to accommodate P. granulata (Henderson, 1885)Abstract The genus Paramunida belongs to the most diverse family of galatheoids and it is commonly reported from the continental slope across the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Examination of material collected by the NOAA RV Townsend Cromwell Cruise near Christmas (Kiritimati) Island, Kiribati, revealed the existence of a new species of Paramunida (P. haigae), which represents the fourth record of the genus for the Central Pacific. Furthermore, recent efforts to unravel phylogenetic relationships and diversification patterns in Paramunida revealed P. granulata (Henderson, 1885) to be the most basally diverging taxon within the genus. This species is clearly distinguished from other species of Paramunida by the spinulation of the carapace and the length of the distomesial spine of the second antennal peduncle article, which in combination with a high level of genetic divergence suggest that this species represents a separate monotypic lineage. A new genus, Hendersonida gen. n., is proposed to accommodate this species based on morphological and molecular evidence. An updated dichotomous identification key for all species of Paramunida is presented.
