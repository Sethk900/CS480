Management effects on nitrogen recovery in a sugarcane crop grown in BrazilThe present study's objectives were to quantify the fertilizer-N and residue-N balances of a sugar cane crop under two trash management systems. The fate of nitrogen (N) derived from fertilizer (NdfF) and N derived from residue (NdfR) was studied comparing: (i) the traditional harvest system with trash burning before harvest (â€œtrash burningâ€) and (ii) an alternative system without trash burning, in which crop residues are left on the soil surface (â€œtrash mulchingâ€). The experiment consisted of three treatments: (i) T1: at planting, the sugarcane crop was fertilized with 63 kg N haâˆ’1 as 15N-labeled ammonium sulfate, and after the 1st harvest received unlabeled trash from T2; (ii) T2: at planting, the crop was fertilized with 63 kg N haâˆ’1 as unlabeled ammonium sulfate. At the 1st harvest time, this treatment received the labeled trash from T1; (iii) T3: at planting, the crop was fertilized with 63 kg N haâˆ’1 as 15N-labeled ammonium sulfate, and every year, immediately before cutting, the crop residues were burnt. After the first harvest fertilizer-N was applied over the total soil area at a rate of 80 kg N haâˆ’1 as unlabeled ammonium sulfate. The results indicated that the trash remaining as a surface blanket resulted in an average N recycling of 105.0 kg haâˆ’1 yearâˆ’1, while the practice of burning the trash produced an average N loss from the system of 83.5 kg haâˆ’1 yearâˆ’1. At the first harvest, about 75% of the labeled N was recovered in the soilâ€“plant system. The majority was found in the plant, indicating a high availability of the fertilizer-N for the crop. At the end of the third crop cycle (2nd ratoon crop harvest), the total output of fertilizer-N (export+burning) was 60% for the burnt-trash treatment, and only 42% (export) for the trash-blanket treatment. The N liberated from the residue is mainly immobilized in the soil, reflecting that sugarcane trash is an N source of slow availability to the crop. This study indicated that green cane harvesting followed by mulching leads to a more efficient recycling of the N applied to the system and therefore reducing fertilizer-N needs.
