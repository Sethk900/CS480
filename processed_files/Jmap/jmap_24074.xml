Meiobenthos and macrobenthos are discrete entities and not artefacts of sampling a size continuum: Comment on Bett (2013)Species size distributions for metazoan benthic invertebrates conform to the highly conservative bimodal pattern, regardless of the sieve mesh sizes or numbers of sieves used in their extraction. This pattern is not an artefact of sampling a size continuum as suggested by computer simulations using just 2 fixed mesh sizes in Bett (2013; Mar Ecol Prog Ser 487:1-6). Meiobenthos and macrobenthos are coherent entities, each with a distinct suite of functional attributes, and should not be regarded as a single unit for ecological modelling purposes.
