Structural Attributes of Schizachyrium scoparium in Restored Texas Blackland Prairies.Structural attributes of the C<sub>4</sub>, perennial bunchgrass <em>Schizachyrium scoparium</em> in restored prairies may be affected by the time since restoration. One hundred plants each in 8-, 17-, and 23-year-old restored prairies and a native Texas Blackland prairie were assessed for the presence/absence and diameter of a hollow crown (i.e., dead center portion), degree of fragmentation, plant height, and tiller density. Structural attributes of <em>S. scoparium</em> plants were generally (1) different between recent (8 years) and older (17 and 23 years) restored prairies (2) similar between the 17- and 23-year-old restored prairies, and (3) more similar between the 8- and 17-year restored prairies and the native, remnant prairie than between the 23-year restored prairie and the native prairie. Plants were shorter in restored prairies, regardless of time since restoration, than in the native prairie. Mean basal area of plants was 80-163% greater in the 17- and 23-year restored prairies compared with the native and 8-year restored prairies. Percentage of hollow crowns and fragmentation was smallest in the 8-year restored prairie, largest in the 17- and 23-year restored prairies, and intermediate in the native prairie. Tiller density exhibited inverse second-order polynomial decreases with increasing plant basal area for all prairies. In contrast to tiller density, diameter of hollow crowns increased logarithmically with increasing plant basal area. Structural attributes of <em>S. scoparium</em> in restored prairies changed predictably with age, despite growing in different communities.
