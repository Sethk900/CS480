First record of nest site and egg guarding in the caecilian Ichthyophis bannanicus (Amphibia: Gymnophiona: Ichthyophiidae)In late July 2010, three clutches of eggs of the caecilian amphibian Ichthyophis bannanicus (Gymnophiona: Ichthyophiidae) were found in the field in the suburbs of Beiliu City, south-east Guangxi Province, South China. This is the first observation of eggs, guarding and characteristics of oviposition sites in the field for this species. Ichthyophis bannanicus is oviparous and there is no post-hatching parental care. The terrestrial oviposition sites were located in underground chambers close to small streams or rice fields. Nest chambers were connected to the surface by two small openings. Clutches contained 24â€“68 eggs, and were each associated with one or two adult females.
