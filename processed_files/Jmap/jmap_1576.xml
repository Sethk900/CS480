Seed dispersal and recruitment limitation are barriers to native recolonization of old-fields in western Australia.<ol><li>Native recolonization of abandoned farmland in the wheat-growing region of western Australia is slow to non-existent, even 45 years after abandonment. Instead, old-fields tend to be dominated by non-native annual grasses. The native vegetation in the region is highly fragmented. We predicted that recovery is limited by seed availability and recruitment failure.</li><li>We compared the seed rain, soil seed bank and extant vegetation of three old-fields and three adjacent native woodland remnants to test our predictions.</li><li>Seed dispersal limitation was evident at two old-fields: species richness of the native seed in the soil seed bank declined at 50-m increments (i.e. 0 m, 50 m and 100 m) into the old-fields. Species richness of recolonizing native vegetation also declined along this transect.</li><li>Recruitment limitation was evident at one old-field, probably linked to the few abundant non-native species that dominated the vegetation. These non-natives dominated the seed supply, and tended to germinate more rapidly than the native seeds.</li><li>In contrast, seed dispersal and recruitment had not limited native recolonization of the third old-field: 91% of the species present in the adjacent remnant had recolonized this old-field. Species richness and abundance of non-natives in the seed supply and extant vegetation were minor compared with that of the other old-fields. Therefore an adequate seed supply of natives, the lack of non-natives and chance natural disturbance events (i.e. cyclone and fire) had probably contributed to this result.</li><li><em>Synthesis and applications.</em> Native recolonization of wheatbelt old-fields is contingent upon the unusual coincidence of seed availability, favourable conditions for recruitment and an absence of competitive non-natives. Grasses, annual herbs and <em>Acacia</em> shrubs are dominant among the few native species that have consistently recolonized these old-fields. In most cases, direct seeding and control of non-natives are the minimum requirements for restoration of wheatbelt old-fields to species-rich eucalypt woodlands.</li></ol>
