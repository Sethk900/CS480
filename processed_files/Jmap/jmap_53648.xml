Paleosol identification and soil stratigraphy in South Island, New ZealandField and laboratory methods used for the identification of paleosols in New Zealand are discussed, and examples are given of their application to both buried and relict paleosols. Field methods include a pedomorphic index based on the quantitative assessment of four or more selected diagnostic properties for each horizon, which is useful under certain conditions to express the relative degree of development of several profiles. The significance of paleosol identification is only fully appreciated when the paleosol is defined stratigraphically and interpreted in terms of time and environment. The basis for defining soil-stratigraphic units in parts of New Zealand is outlined.
