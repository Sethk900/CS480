Environmental Factors Influencing Distribution and Abundance of Trichopteran Larvae in Central Brazilian Mountain StreamsThe relationship among environmental factors, such as temperature, velocity, flow, conductivity, pH, vegetation cover, stream order, precipitation, and human influence was studied in terms of their effects on the spatial and temporal distribution and abundance of trichopteran larvae in streams of the Pireneus mountains of Goi√°s State, Brazil. Samples were collected over one year. Canonical correspondence analysis suggested that vegetation cover and stream order were the main determining factors concerning distribution. The effect of rainfall on abundance of trichopteran larvae was not the same at all stations and varied with season.
