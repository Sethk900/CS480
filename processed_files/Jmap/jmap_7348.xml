Combined effects of temperature and salinity on Stylactis hooperi Sigerfoos 1899 (Hydrozoa, Hydractiniidae). I. Colony growth, development of medusa buds and hydranth degenerationAbstract Colony growth, medusa bud development and hydranth degeneration were studied as functions of temperature (10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35Â°C) and salinity (15, 25, 35, 45 and 55%à¥‘) combinations, in the athecate hydrozoan, Stylactis hooperi. The best growth rates were recorded over a three week period at 20Â°C in salinities of 25 and 35%à¥‘ for both male and female colonies. At 10 and 35Â°C, in all salinities, and in 15 and 55%à¥‘ at all temperatures, colonies showed little or no development. In low salinities male and female polyps developed at the same rate in both low and high temperatures, respectively. However, in high salinity, male polyps developed better at high temperatures while in female polyps, the contrary was observed. In general male colonies showed better development than female. Medusa buds developed only in a few temperatureâ€salinity combinations, the greater development being registered in female colonies at 30Â°C and 25%à¥‘. At the extremes of the salinities and temperatures tested, 100% polyp mortality was registered, with few exceptions. In both male and female colonies, polyp degeneration increased or levelled off with a temperature increase from 15 to 30Â°C in salinities of 25 and 35%à¥‘. At 45%à¥‘, degeneration reached a minimum at 25Â°C, increasing with both increase and decrease in temperature.
