An evaluation of rootstocks for apricots on sandy soilThe nematode-resistant rootstocks Okinawa and Nemaguard yielded better than all other rootstocks for Royal on sandy soil. Bulida performed best on apricot seedling rootstock followed by Okinawa. Prunus mume did not appear promising for either Royal or Bulida. Both Royal and Bulida developed into small trees with low yield capacity when grown on Myrobalan B rootslock.
