Forage Enhancement Plots as a Management Tool for Sonoran Pronghorn Recovery.We studied the efficacy of forage enhancement plots for Sonoran pronghorn (<em>Antilocapra americana sonoriensis</em>) during a drought in a large (130-ha) enclosure. As drought conditions continued, Sonoran pronghorn increased percent of time foraging in forage enhancement plots from 5.3 ± 2.2% (SE) to 47.8 ± 2.8% but showed signs of poor body condition and one died of starvation. Our results confirm the utility of forage enhancement plots for Sonoran pronghorn recovery, but suggest future research be conducted to determine the optimal size and watering regime of plots to increase survival and recruitment during prolonged droughts.
