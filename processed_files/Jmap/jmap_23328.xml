Six new species of Philiris Röber, 1891 (Lepidoptera, Lycaenidae) from Papua New GuineaAbstract Six new species of the large lycaenid genus Philiris Röber, 1891 (Philiris petriei sp. n., Philiris bubalisatina sp. n., Philiris baiteta sp. n., Philiris radicala sp. n., Philiris hindenburgensis sp. n. and Philiris parsonsi sp. n.), from Papua New Guinea, are described and illustrated, as are the early stages of the former taxon, with Litsea sp. near callophyllantha K. Schum (Lauraceae) recorded as the larval food plant. The holotypes of all but the latter are deposited in the ANIC, with that of P. parsonsi located in the BMNH. The external facies and male genitalia of all new species are compared in detail to putative known related species, and the types of these, in nearly all cases, are also illustrated.
