Absence of the 1BL/1RS chromosome translocation in the Kavkaz-derived wheat cultivar TugelaThe South African bread wheat (Triticum aestivumL) cultivar Tugela (Kavkaz/Jaral'S') is highly resistant to stem rust caused by Puccinia graminis Pers. f. sp. tritici Eriks. & Henn. Based on pedigree analysis and infection types, it has previously been assumed that Tugela derived part of its stem rust resistance from Sr31 in Kavkaz, a Russian wheat cultivar containing the 1BL/1RS chromosome translocation. The association of 1BL/1RS, harbouring the Sr31 and Lr26 genes, with inferior dough-mixing properties, would have excluded Tugela as an important source of rust resistance in most breeding programmes. However, the occurrence of stem rust- susceptible segregates in Tugela/Kavkaz progenies, and the absence of Lr26 suggested that Tugela does not contain 1BL/1RS. This was confirmed by cytological comparisons (C-bands) of chromosomes 1B in Tugela and Kavkaz, and by the absence of 1RS-encoded Ï‰ -secalin endosperm protein (SDS-PAGE) in Tugela.
