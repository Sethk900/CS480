Indoor radon: prediction from aeroradioactivity generated by surficial materialsA survey of over 1000 homes in Fairfax County, Virginia shows that a significant proportion of homes in the county have dangerous levels of indoor radon air pollution. Theoretical considerations and soil chemistry show that this can be attributed to retention of significant quantities of Rn-222 progenitors in the earth's regolith. Comparison of survey home locations with a published total-gamma aeroradiometric map shows that aeroradioactivity data can very successfully discriminate between areas of different radon source potential. The aeroradioactivity map was more successful than a method which incorporates a factor for soil permeability through the use of soil maps. It was also more successful than a method of characterizing areas based on geologic mapping units. Data from a portable gamma ray spectrometer indicate that an aerial spectrometric survey would be better than a total-count survey. Airborne gamma-ray spectrometry is likely the best method for regional radon source potential assessment because it is quick, simple, and accurate.
