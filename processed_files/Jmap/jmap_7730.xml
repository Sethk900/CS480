The Steninae and Megalopininae of Chile (Coleoptera, Staphylinidae) 93rd contribution to the knowledge of SteninaeSummary The author gives a revision of the Chilian Megalopininae and Steninae. Results : one species is revalidated (chilensis L.Bck.), a second synonymized (solieri Coiff.& Saiz = gayi Sol.), a third is described as new (saizi n.sp.). Of two species (gayi Sol., anthrax Fairm. & Germ.) lectotypes are designated, two other species already described are new for Chili (Megalopinus plaumanni L.Bck., Stenus endosquameus Puthz). The Chilian fauna of Megalopininae and Steninae is a very rare one concerning number of species as well as number of monophyletic groups. There are no relations to other extratropic groups.
