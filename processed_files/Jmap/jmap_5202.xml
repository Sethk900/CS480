A new genus and five new species of Phoxocephalidae (Crustacea: Amphipoda) from the south-east Brazilian deep seaA new genus and five new species of the family Phoxocephalidae are described from Campos Basin, south-eastern Brazilian deep sea. Bathybirubius gen. nov. appears to be closely related to the Australian genus Birubius Barnard and Drummond, 1978. Also described is a new species of the genus Coxophoxus Barnard JL, 1966. The new species is easily recognized by its elongated antennae 1 and 2, and the obtuse palmar angle in gnathopods 1 and 2. A new species of the abyssal genus Leptophoxoides Barnard JL, 1962, characterized by rostrum constricted, sharp and deflexed, with cephalic dorsal keel present, and triturative molar, monotypic until now, is described and the genus is recorded for the first time from Brazilian waters. Two new species of the genus Pseudharpinia Schellenberg, 1931, discovered among the Brazilian material, are described. In addition, an identification key for the phoxocephalid species currently recorded from Brazil is presented.
