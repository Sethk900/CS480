Protandric simultaneous hermaphroditism and sex ratio in Lysmata nayaritensis Wicksten, 2000 (Decapoda: Caridea)Caridean shrimps display a wide variety of sexual systems, including the newly discovered protandric simultaneous hermaphroditism. Protandric simultaneous hermaphroditism is known only from seven species of Lysmata, and it is not clear if this condition is fixed within the genus or if Lysmata includes species that are simply protandric or gonochoric (with separate sexes). This study uses anatomical data, aquarium experiments, and field observations to demonstrate that Lysmata nayaritensis is another protandric simultaneous hermaphrodite. It is shown that, despite occurring in the tropics, this species fits into the â€œcrowdâ€ species category, with high densities in the field and that the field sex ratio is highly maleâ€biased. Information on the sex allocation and sexual system of more species needs to be examined before these observations can be put into a comparative context within the genus.
