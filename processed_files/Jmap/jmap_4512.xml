Genotype × environment interaction for root yield of elite sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L) lam.) genotypesA study was conducted to determine stability of root yield, and the nature and magnitude of genotype × environment interaction in sweet potato using six recently introduced and one farmers' cultivar, which were grown at four locations for three consecutive years. There was significant variation among genotypes with respect to root yield. The genotypes significantly interacted with the environment and a large proportion of this interaction was accounted for the linear type G × E interactions. TIS-70357-7 and TIS-9465-3 genotypes exhibited satisfactory stability for root yield. Generally, the newly introduced genotypes gave high root yield and were more responsive to high yielding environments than the local cultivar (Becule) which appeared to be better adapted to poor environment. Sweet potato breeders should emphasize G × E interaction while developing high yielding and stable genotypes.
