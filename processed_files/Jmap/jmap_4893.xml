Ecological aspects of the pumpkin toadlet, Brachycephalus garbeanus Miranda-Ribeiro, 1920 (Anura: Neobatrachia: Brachycephalidae), in a highland forest of southeastern BrazilBrachycephalus garbeanus is an aposematic toadlet, endemic to the Atlantic Forest in the mountains of the state of Rio de Janeiro, southeastern Brazil. Information regarding the ecology of species in this genus is scarce, with no information on most species, including B. garbeanus. We provide ecological information about B. garbeanus, in particular regarding microhabitat use, sexual dimorphism in body size, and feeding habits. Our study was conducted in a montane area of the Parque Estadual dos Três Picos, the largest State park in Rio de Janeiro. Most of the B. garbeanus in the study area were found on the forest floor leaf litter. Females were larger on average than males. Brachycephalus garbeanus consumed a wide array of prey, comprising exclusively invertebrates and predominantly arthropods. There were seasonal differences in the diet composition, but mites and ants were important in both wet and dry seasons.
