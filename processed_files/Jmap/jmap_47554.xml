A new genus and species of Nematalycidae (Acari: Endeostigmata)Osperalycus tenerphagus, a new genus and species of Nematalycidae (Acari: Endeostigmata), is described from Ohio, USA, using light microscopy and low-temperature scanning electron microscopy. Specimens were extracted from two different loam soils. This genus can be readily distinguished from the other genera of Nematalycidae by the simple setae that line the opisthosoma. The mouthparts are especially distinct in possessing three-segmented palps, an unusual vessel-shaped structure, and rutella that overlap at the midline. The discovery of rutella in this genus and in two other genera indicates that the Nematalycidae can be more confidently assigned to the Endeostigmata (Sarcoptiformes).http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:A64A6612-B66C-4814-80A9-3856DEBE8C46
