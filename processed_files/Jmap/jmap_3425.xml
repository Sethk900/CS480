METHODS FOR TRAPPING SAGE GROUSE CENTROCERCUS-UROPHASIANUS IN COLORADO USADuring 1963-1980 at least 6231 sage grouse (C. urophasianus) (5147 adults, 1084 juveniles) were captured and banded in Colorado. Most (5752) were banded since 1973. Four trapping methods were evaluated for capture efficiency (spotlighting, drive traps, stationary cannon nets and vehicle-mounted cannon nets) between 1977 and 1980 during which 1955 grouse were captured. Spotlighting resulted in most captures (1326; 67.8%) followed by drive trapping (347; 17.7%), vehicle-mounted cannon nets (221; 11.3%) and stationary cannon nets (61; 3.1%). Spotlighting was least selective for age or sex of birds trapped except when trapping on leks. Drive trapping and both methods of cannon-netting were selective for juveniles. Trapping mortality was < 1.0% for all trapping methods with injuries most common in drive trapping and cannon-netting.
