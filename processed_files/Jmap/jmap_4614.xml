Physical and chemical properties associated with food quality in sorghumSamples of 13 genetically diverse sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] accessions were analysed for physical properties and chemical composition. The food (injera) quality and the phenolic (condensed tannins) content of six sorghum samples were also determined. The accessions showed a wide variation in protein (7.99 to 17.8%), lipids (2.52 to 4.76%), starch (51.88 to 85%), and amylose (12.30 to 28.38%) content. Grain weight varied in a wide range, and endosperm texture varied from intermediate to completely starchy. Linoleic acid (18:2) and oleic acid (18:1) were the major fatty acid constituents of sorghum lipids. Only a few significant correlations were observed among the physical and chemical properties. Three of the six accessions used for sensory analysis, namely Ambajeettee, AL-70 and ETS 2752 were chosen for their desirable properties in injera making. The chemical and physical properties of the selected accessions were characterised by high protein content, low tannins, intermediate endosperm texture, and white seed colours. Red seeded sorghum and white seeded sorghum with pigmented testa were found to be less desired.
