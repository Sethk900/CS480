ROOT RESPIRATION IN DRY GRASSLANDThe autotrophic (root and rhizomicrobial) and heterotrophic (basal) components of soil respiration were determined in the carbon balance study on a (try sandy grassland with the main objectives of determining the ratio of these components and the effect of root water content on root respiration. The respiration of root and rhizomicrobial component was higher than basal respiration in most of the growing period, the ratio increased from 0.24 to 3.39 following the temperature and vegetation's activity. Root respiration gave a very steep gradient response to changes in soil water content (SWC) range, characteristic under droughts, showing optimum response in SWC range, seldom occurring in the field on the other hand, roots can access soil water in deeper layers during dry periods, therefore the strong dependence of root respiration on root water content could explain significant part of variations in respiration by drougth stressed ecosystems.
