               On the systematics, distribution and conservation status of               Ichthyophis longicephalus               Pillai, 1986 (Amphibia: Gymnophiona: Ichthyophiidae)             The caecilian Ichthyophis longicephalus was described in 1986 based on a single specimen. Only one specimen has been referred subsequently to this species, and the validity of that referral has been questioned. Seven specimens discovered in 2009â€“2010 at two new localities and two specimens collected in 1990 from a third locality are referred here to I.Â longicephalus. These specimens are described and compared with the poorly preserved holotype. Mitochondrial DNA data are consistent with the interpretation that the new specimens represent a single species distinct from (and most closely related to I. tricolor among) sampled congeners. The previously referred specimen, from c.Â 320Â km south of the type locality, is not I.Â longicephalus and probably represents an undescribed species. The â€œrediscoveryâ€ of I.Â longicephalus in forests and disturbed habitats indicates that the species probably could be transferred from the Data Deficient to the Least Concern category of the IUCN Red List.
