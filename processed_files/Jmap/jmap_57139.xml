Discussion of Statistical Evaluation of Factors Affecting Indicator Bacteria in Urban Storm-Water Runoff by J. M. Hathaway, W. F. Hunt, and O. D. Simmons IIIFor a residential watershed in Raleigh, North Carolina, the authors monitored storm-water runoff for indicator bacteria during 20 rain events, and statistically evaluated factors affecting such bacteria. The original paper and a follow-up paper (Hathaway and Hunt 2011) increased understanding of indicator bacteria export from urban watersheds and identified factors contributing to the complexity of such export. The authors may want to comment on how their Raleigh study relates to a recent study by He et al. (2010), who evaluated indicator bacteria during 10 rain events in storm-water runoff from a residential watershed in Calgary, Canada. The following additional comments and questions are intended to obtain additional information about the Raleigh experimental watershed runoff statistics for each studied Raleigh rain event.
