Some new and rare species of Ameiridae (Copepoda: Harpacticoida) from the Isles of Scilly, UKThree new species of the harpacticoid family Ameiridae are described from clean sand at high water neap tide on St Martin's Flat, Isles of Scilly. Ameiropsis martinis sp. nov. appears most closely related to A. australis Kunz, 1975 but can be distinguished from it by the shape of the rostrum and the armature of the operculum, female genital field and the male P5 baseoendopodal lobe. Sarsameira parexilis sp. nov. was originally identified as S. exilis T. and A. Scott, 1894 but the females can be distinguished from S. exilis by their smaller body size and shape of the caudal ramus whilst the males can be distinguished by the 12-segmented antennule and four setae on the P5 baseoendopodal lobe. Ameira longispina sp. nov. is unique within the â€œAmeiraâ€ complex of genera and species because of the marked elongation of the inner spine on the basis of the male P1. This species is tentatively placed in Ameira Boeck, 1865, but has features which indicate that it probably occupies an intermediate position between this genus and Psammameira Noodt, 1952. The previously unknown males of Sarsameira perezi Bodin, 1970 and Nitocra elegans (T. Scott, 1905) are also described.
