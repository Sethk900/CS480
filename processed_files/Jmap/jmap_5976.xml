A Simplified Close-Range Photogrammetric Technique for Soil Erosion AssessmentSurface reconstruction using digital photogrammetry offers a great\nadvantage for soil erosion research. The technology can be cumbersome\nfor field application because it relies on the accurate measurement of\ncontrol points, often using a survey-grade instrument. Also, even though\ndigital photogrammetry has been used in much soil erosion research, its\nsensitivity in detecting soil elevation changes has rarely been\nassessed. This study aimed at simplifying the digital photogrammetric\nprocedure for soil erosion research and assessing the sensitivity of\nthis technology to detect soil erosion. To simplify the technology, we\npropose to combine a photogrammetric procedure for control point\ngeneration in a first step, followed by a conventional photogrammetric\ndigital elevation model (DEM) extraction procedure. The performance of\nthe method was assessed in the laboratory and tested in the field to\ndigitize ephemeral gullies. In the accuracy test of photogrammetric\nsurvey step, we found that the maximum length measurement error was 3.4\nmm, while the maximum angular deviation from the vertical or horizontal\naxes was 0.93 degrees. The maximum error between control point\ncoordinates generated by photogrammetry and those generated by a\nsurvey-grade total station was 26 mm on the horizontal axes and 10 mm on\nthe vertical axis. We also found that the sensitivity of digital\nphotogrammetry in detecting soil surface elevation changes was similar\nto that of a laser scanner when the detection was performed on smooth\nsoil surfaces and when the standard deviation of the elevation changes\nwas approximately three times the precision of the photogrammetric DEM.
