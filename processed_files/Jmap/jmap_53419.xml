Phenotypic plasticity in rice: responses to fertilization and inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungiAims Changes in the phenotype of crops (phenotypic plasticity) are known to play an important role in determining responses to nutrient availability, with the direction and magnitude of plasticity of individual traits being crucial for grain yields. Our study analysed the direction, magnitude and hierarchy of plastic responses of yield-related traits (i.e. biomass allocation and yield components) of rice (Oryza sativa L.) to nutrient availability. We estimated the effect of inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on these characteristics of phenotypic plasticity.
