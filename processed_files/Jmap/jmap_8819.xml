Impact of Regional Species Pool on Grasshopper Restoration in Hay MeadowsAgri-environment schemes are the most widely adopted political measure to maintain and restore farmland biodiversity in Europe. However, abiotic and biotic factors often limit the success of ecological restoration. Among the biotic factors, the size of the local and regional species pool is a major constraint. This is only well documented for plants. We therefore wanted to know if a small regional species pool can also limit restoration efforts of invertebrates. Specifically, we tested if by relocating grasshoppers from further away, we could overcome regional species pool limitations on hay meadows under the Swiss agri-environment scheme, so-called Ecological Compensation Area meadows (ECA meadows). All meadows had been under restoration for 6 years and were formerly intensively used hay meadows. Two grasshopper species, Euthystira brachyptera and Mecostethus parapleurus, were selected; E. brachyptera was not found in the regional species pool and M. parapleurus had nearly disappeared. In 2004, 1,400 grasshopper individuals of each species were taken from the nearest large source populations and distributed equally on seven ECA meadows and seven control meadows. In 2005, we evaluated whether the species had successfully established. Only one individual of M. parapleurus was found. We conclude that a small regional species pool is not the only constraint for the reestablishment of grasshoppers on restoration meadows. Also, other factors such as habitat quality appear to constrain the reestablishment of grasshoppers on restoration meadows. Additional restoration efforts specifically targeted at grasshopper restoration are needed, and innovative techniques have to be developed to overcome the relocation constraints.
