Reproduction of the Freshwater Catfish Pimelodella pappenheimi in Southern BrazilIn the subtropical Atlantic rain forest of southern Brazil, reproduction of the catfish Pimelodella pappenheimi was studied over a two years period in a small coastal stream representing a widely undisturbed aquatic habitat. According to analyses of the gonad status, reproduction is mainly seasonal with a peak in the rainy summer months, consisting of multiple spawning. The average body length of the fishes attaining sexual maturity was the same in both sexes. At the study site summer storms cause flash floods, and heavy rainfalls can suddenly increase the river flow. Reproductive females were found to burrow in the clay palisades of the river sediments which is regarded a behavioural adaptation protecting the offspring from being washed away.
