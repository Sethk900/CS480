The Importance of Phytogenic Mounds (Nebkhas) for Restoration of Arid Degraded Rangelands in Northern Sinai.Natural accumulation of wind-borne sediments within or around the canopies of plants plays an important role in the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of many coastal and desert ecosystems. The formation of such phytogenic mounds (nebkhas) creates patches that can strongly influence the spatial distribution of plant and soil resources. In land restoration of arid and semiarid environments it is important to study the potential role of such biological patchiness that may provide sites for coexistence of species with different life and growth forms. Our main objective was to test whether the nebkhas of a leguminous shrub, <em>Retama raetam</em> (white broom), promote restoration of herbaceous vegetation and soil in the degraded rangelands of northern Sinai. Vegetation and microclimatic and edaphic characteristics within the nebkhas, as well as within internebkha spaces, were compared for ungrazed and grazed sites. Abundance and richness of herbaceous plants were positively related to nebkha area, which explained more of the variance of abundance and richness in the grazed site than in the ungrazed one. Protection from grazing, especially on nebkhas, was associated with an increase in abundance and richness of herbaceous plants, improved soil microclimate, and increased soil fine particles and nutrient concentrations. The results suggest that management (in casu protection from grazing) of nebkhas of woody perennial shrubs changes rangeland conditions and improves the resource regulatory processes. Furthermore, nebkhas of unpalatable plants have the potential to preserve plant diversity in overgrazed plant communities, because they are effective in capturing and retaining water, soil materials, and propagules within and from nearby areas, resources that would otherwise be lost.
