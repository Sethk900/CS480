The freshwater crabs of Lake Kivu (Crustacea: Decapoda: Brachyura: Potamonautidae)Lake Kivu is a volcanic barrier lake in the East African rift valley whose freshwater crab fauna (Potamonautidae) is largely undocumented. The present taxonomic revision revealed four species of freshwater crabs from Lake Kivu: Potamonautes idjwiensis (Chace, 1942), Potamonautes mutandensis (Chace, 1942), Potamonautes lirrangensis (Rathbun, 1904) and Potamonautes bourgaultae, sp. nov. Potamonautes idjwiensis and P.Â mutandensis are redescribed and distributional maps of all four species are provided. The four species are compared with each other, each species is illustrated, and a key to the species is included. The freshwater crab diversities of the African Great Lakes are also briefly compared.
