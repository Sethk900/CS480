Attendance at a Sage Grouse Lek: Implications for Spring CensusesNumbers of adult male sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) increased between early March and late April-early May. Yearling cocks began attending in numbers when female numbers peaked in early April. Hens stayed for shorter daily and seasonal periods than cocks did. Data on seasonal and daily attendance confirm the validity of the Patterson census technique, but suggest that it is more restrictive than necessary. Peak numbers of cocks can be estimated to within 90 percent by the highest of 3 counts between 1/ hour before and 11/2 hours after sunrise during the first 3 or the second and third weeks after the peak of breeding.
