Nuevos aportes a la taxonomía y distribución de las especies de Heteromeyenia Potts, en Argentina (Porifera, Spongillidae)Heteromeyenia horsti Kilian, was found in the Mascardi lake, Río Negro Province, Argentina. The taxonomic study was made on the comparative analysis of the microscleres, because the sponges had no gemmules. The present one is the southernmost place for argentinian freshwater sponges. The analysis of the material from different ponds of Corrientes Province (Argentina), allows to extend the geographical distribution of Heteromeyenia baileyi (Bowerbank). Thus, Heteromeyenia Potts is represented by three species in Argentina: H. stepanowi (Dybowsky, 1884), H. baileyi (Bowerbank, 1863), and H. horsti Kilian, 1976.
