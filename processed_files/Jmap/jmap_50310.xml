Polyploid races, genetic structure and morphological features of earthworm Aporrectodea rosea (Savigny, 1826) (Oligochaeta, Lumbricidae) in UkraineFour chromosomal races (2n=36, 3n=54, 6n=108, 8n=144) and 96 clones have been revealed among 224 specimens of the earthworm AporrectodeaÂ rosea over the territory of Ukraine by means of karyological analysis and biochemical genetic marking. Each population has been showed by several clones at least; moreover the clones from different places have never been identical. The clones in the range of one population can be identified with the set of quantitative and qualitative parameters.
