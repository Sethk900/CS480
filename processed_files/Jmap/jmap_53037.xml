One new species of the genus Belisana Thorell, 1898 (Araneae, Pholcidae) from northern VietnamOne new species Belisana denticulata sp. n. (â™‚) is reported from northern Vietnam based on material collected by fogging the forest canopy. This species resembles B. scharffi Huber, 2005, but can be distinguished by relatively long distance between proximal parts of proximo-lateral apophysis and distal apophysis on male chelicerae, by presence of a nearly saddle-shaped prolateral sclerite on procursus, and by different shape of retrolateral membranous flap on procursus. Type specimens are deposited in the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology in Hanoi.
