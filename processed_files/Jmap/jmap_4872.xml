A review of the genus Scyracepon Tattersall, 1905 (Crustacea: Isopoda: Bopyridae), with description of a new species from ChinaThe parasitic isopod genus Scyracepon Tattersall, 1905 is recorded from China for the first time, and a new species, Scyracepon distincta, is described from the host Jonas distinctus (Brachyura: Corystidae). Females of the new species can be distinguished from those of the other six species of Scyracepon by their subequal mid-dorsal projections on pereomeres 6 and 7 (lacking on other pereomeres) and pleonal segments with medial but not lateral fusion. Males of the new species have the first two pleomeres free, pleomeres 3â€“5 fused, and bear midventral tubercles on all pereomeres and the first pleomere. This is the first record of any species of Corystidae bearing parasitic isopods. Remarks on, and a key to, the seven known species of Scyracepon are provided.
