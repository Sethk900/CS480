Description of Alpheus cedrici sp. n., a strikingly coloured snapping shrimp (Crustacea, Decapoda, Alpheidae) from Ascension Island, central Atlantic OceanAbstract Alpheus cedrici sp. n. is described based on two specimens collected under rocks while scuba diving off the coast of Ascension Island, central Atlantic Ocean. The new species belongs to the Alpheus macrocheles (Hailstone, 1835) species complex and appears to be most closely related to the easternâ€“central Atlantic Alpheus macrocheles, the western Atlantic Alpheus amblyonyx Chace, 1972, and the eastern Pacific Alpheus bellimanus Lockington, 1877 and Alpheus rectus Kim & Abele, 1988. However, it differs from all these species by a combination of morphological characters and by a diagnostic and striking colour pattern.
