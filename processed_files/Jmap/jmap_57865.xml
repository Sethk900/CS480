Stochastic Assessment of Reservoir Storage-Yield Relationships in PortugalAbstractThis paper aims to establish design criteria that simultaneously meet (1) the stochastic nature of the streamflow regime in Portuguese rivers and (2) the relationship between such a regime and the mean annual flow depth. The data set consists of 54 streamflow samples from unregulated Portuguese rivers. A large number of synthetic streamflow series were generated by using a probabilistic model at the annual level and a disaggregation model, namely the method of fragments, at the monthly level. Based on an operation with fixed yield and time-based reliability, behavioral analysis was applied to the synthetic series to estimate the storage capacities of hypothetical reservoirs. The Gumbel distribution was fitted to the previous estimates to obtain design storage capacities with specified values of reliability. After showing that the former design capacities were significantly correlated with the mean annual flow depth of the sample series, curves that expressed that relationship were defined. The results consistently showed that, for a given operation condition, as the mean annual flow depth increases, the required specific storage decreases.
