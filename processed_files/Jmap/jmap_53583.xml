Two new species of the genus Cophixalus from the Raja Ampat Islands west of New Guinea (Amphibia, Anura, Microhylidae)Based on morphological and bioacoustic traits, two new species of the microhylid genus Cophixalus Boettger, 1892 are described from the Raja Ampat Islands off the western tip of New Guinea. Both are small (SUL < 23 mm), slender, scansorial species that are morphologically most similar to Cophixalus tetzlaffi Günther and C. monosyllabus Günther, two congeners also known only from far western New Guinea. Their description brings the total number of Cophixalus known from New Guinea and surrounding islands to 46, and the total number from western New Guinea (Papua and West Papua Provinces including the Raja Ampat Islands) to 10. One Cophixalus specimen from Salawati Island is considered a hermaphrodite because it has a well-developed vocal sac and vocal slits, but also has an ovary containing eggs in an advanced developmental stage. This frog uttered advertisement calls that did not differ from calls of conspecific males. The first evidence of the genus Cophixalus from Misool Island is also documented.
