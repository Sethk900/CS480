Optimum temperature and inoculation levels for in vitro production of Pratylenchus brachyurus on carrot discsPratylenchus brachyurus is an economically important parasite of several agricultural crops, including potato, groundnut, maize and soybean. Large numbers of this species are required for research on pathogenecity, host plant resistance and efficacy of nematicides. The effect of inoculation density and temperature, as well as development time of P. brachyurus were studied to develop an' efficient in vitro mass-rearing system on carrot discs. The optimum inoculation density was determined in a growth chamber by inoculating carrot discs with 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 individuals per disc. The reproduction rate of P. brachyurus on carrot disc cultures was evaluated at temperatures of 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35°C, with fifty females inoculated per disc. The optimum inoculation density was 50 individuals per disc. Incubation for 80 days provided a 13-fold increase in P. brachyurus numbers, compared to 60 days. The optimum temperature determined for reproduction was 30°C, as indicated by the highest population density and RF-value.
