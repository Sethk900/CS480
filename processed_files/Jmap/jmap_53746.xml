Genetic and biological characterization of a Cuban tick strain from               Rhipicephalus sanguineus               complex and its sensitivity to different chemical acaricidesThe chemical control with acaricides is still the most efficient method to control ticks. Vaccination is an alternative method, but currently there is no vaccine with protective antigens against infestations of Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Latreille, 1806) in dogs. However, the anti-tick vaccine progress requires a tick experimental model to provide relevant biological data. The present communication summarizes the characterization of the first isolation of a R. sanguineus Cuban field strain. The Cuban strain was closely related to R. sanguineus sensu lato belonging to the northern lineage or tropical species. This strain was resistant to amitraz. A colony of R. sanguineus ticks was established from this isolation. Feeding protocols and environmental requirements for maintenance under controlled laboratory conditions of this tick strain are described and its laboratory life cycle is characterized. The cycle was completed in 85 days under the conditions established in the laboratory and after each cycle; 16% of the total initial eggs are females able to lay eggs. These results provide the colonyâ€™s long-term maintenance and reliable production of ticks under standardized conditions suitable as an experimental model for a variety of biological studies including the successful identification of new candidates for anti-tick vaccines.
