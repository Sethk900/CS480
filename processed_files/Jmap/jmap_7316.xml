The effects of wind and diel vertical migrations on the distribution of freshwater ZooplanktonA 24 hr survey of the behaviour of the Zooplankton in a shallow (approximately 1 m), eutrophic pond showed that both vertical distribution and abundanceâ€changes at the sampling site reflect several interacting factors, i.e., windforce and direction, local depth, diel vertical migrations, swimming capabilities of the animals, illumination, and, probably, â€œavoidance of shoreâ€; reactions. Small zooplankters, lacking strong powers of locomotion (i.e., Rotifera, Copepoda nauplii) exhibit similar features: their distribution is rather homogeneous through time and space, and is chiefly conditioned by wind. Larger plankters â€ such as adult copepods and cladocerans â€ tend to concentrate at different depths during a 24 hr cycle; as a consequence differential horizontal currents displace varying proportions of their populations at different times, thus either concentrating the organisms at a given area, or carrying them away from it. This variability suggests that the influence of the factors mentioned on the estimates of zooplanktonic abundance and biomass â€ based on samples collected under different conditions â€ must be thoroughly evaluated when carrying out ecological investigations.
