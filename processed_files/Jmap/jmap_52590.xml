Black Tinamou background storyIn a recent issue of The Auk: Ornithological Advances, four South American researchers reported new ecological information, including video and sound recordings, for the northern subspecies of Black Tinamou (Tinamus osgoodi hershkovitzi), an elusive bird with a disjunct range on the lower montane slopes of the eastern Andes (Negret et al. 2015). As one of the editors of The Book of Eggs (Hauber 2014), this new article jumped out at me for a couple of reasons. First, although the book included images of the egg of the Black Tinamou, we reported that almost nothing was known about the breeding and reproductive behavior of the species; in a perfect example of a sudden shift in scientific data, this has now changed. Second, I became curious about the subspecies' name, since I had worked for mammalogist Philip Hershkovitz at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago in the early 1980s.
