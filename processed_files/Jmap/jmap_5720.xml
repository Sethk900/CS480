Four species of Caligus M√ºller, 1785 (Copepoda, Siphonostomatoida, Caligidae) parasitic on marine fishes of TaiwanFour species of Caligus, with two new species, are reported from five species of marine fishes of Taiwan. They are: Caligus arii Bassett‚ÄSmith, 1898 on the body surface of Trichiurus lepturus Linnaeus, Caligus dasyaticus Rangnekar, 1957 on the body surface of Dasyatis navarrae (Steindachner), Caligus dactylus n. sp. on the gill filaments of Dactyloptera peterseni (Nystr√∂m), and Caligus lutjani n. sp. in the oral/gill cavities of Lutjanus argentimaculaltus (Forssk√•l) and Lutjanus bohar (Forssk√•l). Both C. arii and C. dasyaticus are reported for the first time from Taiwan. Caligus dactylus differs from its congeners by the possession of the following combination of features: large myxal process on the maxilliped; a pair of parallel tines on the sternal furca with truncate tip; simple elements (without accessory process) at the tip of leg 1 exopod; and an armature formula of I‚Ä0; I,III on leg 4. Caligus lutjani is distinguished by carrying a two‚Äsegmented abdomen; a pair of diverged tines on the sternal furca with acute tip; an accessory process on the middle two of the terminal four elements on the exopod of leg 1; and a bipectinate, spiniform process on the exopod of leg 4 at the insertion of each of the five outer spines.
