The use of invertebrate functional groups to characterize ecosystem attributes in selected streams and rivers in south BrazilAn analysis conducted at nine stream/river sites in the Atlantic Forest region in the State of Paran√°, Brazil used macroinvertebrate functional feeding group (FFG) assessments to evaluate ecological condition of the sites. The FFG approach categorizes qualitative macroinvertebrate collections according to their morphological-behavioral adaptations for food acquisition (e.g. scrapers that harvest non-filamentous, attached algae from stable surfaces in flowing water). FFG ratios were employed as surrogates for stream/river ecosystem attributes: balance between autotrophy and heterotrophy; linkage between riparian inputs of coarse particulate organic matter and in-stream food webs; relative dominance of fine particulate organic matter in transport (suspended load) compared to that deposited in the sediments; and geomorphic stability of the channel. The analyses indicated that all nine sites were heterotrophic, six of the nine carried expected levels of suspended organic load and showed below expected linkage with riparian inputs, and in only two were stable substrates limiting. The implications of the findings and recommendations for further analysis and modifications of the protocol are discussed.
