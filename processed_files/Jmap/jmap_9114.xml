Restoration of the Sieperda Tidal Marsh in the Scheldt Estuary, The NetherlandsBecause of land reclamation, reinforcement of dikes, and the deepening of shipping channels, large areas of tidal marshes have been removed or eroded from the Scheldt estuary during the last two centuries. Tidal wetland restoration contributes toward compensating this loss of habitat. Not all restoration projects are meticulously planned, however; some are forced by nature. During a severe storm in 1990, a dike was breached in the brackish part of the Scheldt estuary and returned tidal influence to the Sieperda polder. In the 10 years since the dike breach, the former polder has changed into a brackish tidal marsh. Here we report on the geomorphologic and ecological developments that have taken place in the marsh. Tidal intrusion into the former polder turned crop fields into mudflats and changed pastures into salty marsh vegetation. The digging of a new creek improved marsh hydrology and enhanced tidal intrusion further into the marsh. Macrofauna typical of estuarine mudflats established rapidly in the developing marsh. Vegetation succession took place rapidly. Within 5 years, large areas of mudflats became covered with marsh vegetation. Birds characteristic of salt marshes were observed breeding or seen foraging in the marsh. The number of wading birds declined as areas of mudflat became overgrown. It is demonstrated that tidal flow is the engine to tidal marsh restoration. Tidal influence caused geomorphologic changes, which directed ecological developments in the former polder.
