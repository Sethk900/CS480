Roosts of Allen's Lappet-Browed Bat in Northern Arizona.In Arizona, USA, Allen's lappet-browed bat (<em>Idionycteris phyllotis</em>) forms maternity colonies in ponderosa pine (<em>Pinus ponderosa</em>) snags. There is little information on the roosting habitat of males. We used radiotelemetry to locate 16 maternity, 3 postlactating, and 2 bachelor roosts and combined data with unpublished data for maternity roosts (<em>n</em> = 11) located in 1993-1995. Most (96%) maternity roosts were in large-diameter (x&#772; ± SE: 64 ± 2.7 cm) ponderosa pine snags under sloughing bark. Models that best predicted the probability of a snag's use as a maternity roost indicated bats selected taller snags closer to forest roads than comparison snags. Maternity roosts averaged 11 bats per roost (SE = 2, <em>n</em> = 15; from exit counts) and were an average distance of 1.6 km from capture sites (SE = 0.3, <em>n</em> = 17). Bachelor roosts were in vertical sandstone cliff faces in pinyon-juniper (<em>Pinus edulis</em>-<em>Juniperus</em> spp.) woodlands approximately 12 km from capture sites; these and other capture records in Arizona indicated sexual segregation may have occurred during the maternity season. Of 11 maternity snag roosts located in 1993-1995, only one continued to function as a roost. Resource managers should maintain patches of large-diameter ponderosa pine snags with peeling bark to provide maternity roosting habitat for Allen's lappet-browed bat.
