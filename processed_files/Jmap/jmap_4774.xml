New montane, subterranean congeners of a littoral millipede, genus Thalassisobates (Diplopoda: Julida: Nemasomatidae)Two new species are described in the hitherto monotypic genus Thalassisobates Vehoeff, 1908: T. emesesensis sp. nov. from the mesovoid shallow stratum of La Gomera (Canary Islands), and T. almeriensis sp. nov. from a cave in Almería, southern continental Spain. Notes on the morphology and distribution of T. littoralis (Silvestri, 1903) are given, and the monophyly and relationships of Thalassisobates are discussed. Other examples of arthropod genera with a similar habitat duality: marine littoral on one side, and subterranean montane on the other, are given. http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:6455CE47-E9DB-4A9D-8074-D0D87A7816C2
