Adsorption–desorption reactions of selenium in some soils of IndiaAdsorption/desorption behavior of selenium (Se) was investigated in laboratory studies for surface soil samples varying in physico-chemical characteristics and mineralogical composition. In general, greater amount of Se was sorbed by acidic soils than alkaline soils; the only exception was the alkaline seleniferous soil from Barwa in northwestern India. Adsorption data for Se fitted well to Freundlich isotherm and log K values were negatively correlated with pH (r=−0.883***), electrical conductivity (r=−0.823***), CaCO3 (r=−0.829**) and clay content (−0.639*) of the soils. Selenium adsorption data also conformed to Langmuir isotherm. Adsorption maxima was significantly correlated with organic carbon (r=0.757**) and free iron (r=0.773**) content of the soils. Constant related to bonding energy was significantly correlated with pH (r=−0.851**) and organic matter content (r=0.694*) of the soils. The distribution coefficient (Kd) showed that at the same value of surface coverage, the acidic soils had greater affinity for Se as compared to the alkaline soils. Amount of Se desorbed in the 0.25 M KCl and 0.1 M KH2PO4 was strongly influenced by pH of the soils. In acidic soils, greater amount of sorbed Se was desorbed in KH2PO4 than in KCl and the reverse was true for alkaline soils. As KCl desorbs predominantly selenate, the water-soluble form of Se in soil solution, the Se availability and absorption by plants should be more in alkaline soils as are found in northwestern India, rather than in soils with acidic reaction.
