Taxonomic revision of the genus Chiloporter Lestage (Ameletopsidae: Ephemeroptera) with notes on its biology and distributionA taxonomic revision of the genus Chiloporter is presented confronting new material collected in Chile and Argentina, with the literature of the genus. Unknown developmental stages are described; association of larvae and winged stages is confirmed here by rearing. The synonymy of the extant species is proposed. Notes on the biology and distribution are also included.
