Topography-specific seed dispersal by Japanese macaques in a lowland forest on Yakushima Island, Japan.<ol><li>We investigated patterns of seed dispersal (i.e. dispersal distances and topography of seed-deposition sites) via the cheek pouches of Japanese macaques (<em>Macaca fuscata yakui</em>) during three seasons in a lowland forest on Yakushima Island, Japan.</li><li>The mean seed-dispersal distances were 16路7, 26路1, 41路8, and 32路4 m from the trunks of mother trees of <em>Myrica rubra</em>, <em>Persea thunbergii</em>, <em>Neolitsea sericea</em>, and <em>Litsea acuminata</em>, respectively.</li><li>We assessed the possible effect of macaque foraging patterns and the spatial distribution of fruiting trees on topography-specific seed dispersal. The topography of the locations of macaques differed across seasons, likely because the spatial distribution of fruiting trees determined the seasonal foraging patterns of macaques.</li><li>In early summer, macaques foraged on a ridge and fed on fruits of <em>M. rubra</em> and <em>P. thunbergii</em>, which were primarily distributed and dispersed within this area. In contrast, during the winter, macaques foraged within a valley and fed on fruits of <em>L. acuminata</em>, which were chiefly distributed and dispersed within the valley.</li><li>Seeds of <em>M. rubra</em>, <em>P. thunbergii</em>, and <em>L. acuminata</em> were directly dispersed to the specific topographic areas in which adult trees were distributed and in which juveniles have a predictably high probability of survival relative to random sites.</li></ol>
