Ionic composition and distribution in saline seeps of southwestern North Dakota, U.S.A.Saline seeps, a common problem in the Northern Great Plains, were studied at four sites in southwestern North Dakota. Saturation extracts within seeps were dominated by sodium, magnesium, and sulfate. Where present, gypsum controlled calcium concentrations. Ionic distributions within and around seeps were influenced by precipitation and re-solution reactions, freeze-thaw phenomena, and ion pairing. Ion pairing reduced Ca2+ and Mg2+ activities to a greater extent than Na+, resulting in elevated SAR levels in seeps and surrounding soils. Dryland salinity resulted in a form of desertification around seep areas.
