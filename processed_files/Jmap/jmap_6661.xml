Standardization of an experimental micro bread-baking technique for evaluation of wheat cultivarsAn experimental micro bread-baking technique using 10 g of wheat flour was employed to determine the levels of various ingredients to obtain optimum loaf volumes. Flour samples were mixed with different ingredients and allowed to ferment in a fermentation cabinet for 90 min at 30°C. Thereafter they were proofed for 45 min at 30°C to a height of 4,5 cm and then baked for 13 min at 232°C. The optimum levels of the various bread-baking ingredients were: flour (10 g), sugar (0,6 g), salt (0,15 g), yeast (0,75 g), shortening (0,3 g), malted barley (0,025 g) and ascorbic acid (50 ppm).
