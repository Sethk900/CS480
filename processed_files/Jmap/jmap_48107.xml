Range and natural history of point-tailed palmcreepers (Aves: Furnariidae)The point-tailed palmcreeper Berlepschia rikeri is a distinctive Furnariidae species, very shy and poorly known. In this paper we present natural history notes on this species as well as a detailed review of its range. This paper summarizes anecdotal observations gathered during 10Â years of ornithological investigation of the central Brazilian Cerrado, as well as data obtained in 13 Brazilian and overseas collections and from online databases. We found that B. rikeri is widely distributed across north and central South America, where it is strictly associated with palm groves, especially those of Mauritia spp. and Orbignya phalerata. Despite being a habitat specialist, this species can be found in a wide spectrum of vegetation formations, from lowland rainforests to high plateau grasslands. This is an insectivorous species, which constructs a stick nest concealed within the fronds of Mauritia palms. Its juvenile plumage is similar to that of the adult.
