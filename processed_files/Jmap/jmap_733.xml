Soil aggregate fraction 1â€“5 mm: An indicator for soil quality in rangelands.Aggregate size distribution affects the soil's physical quality and fertility. Widely used aggregation indices include the size fractions <0.25 mm, >2 mm, and >8 mm, and the mean weight diameter of aggregates. A recent study from the semi-arid hilly rangeland of the Negev desert, Israel revealed considerable impact of the type of surface cover (shrub patches, trampling routes, and the remainder of the interpatch spaces) on these indices, but only limited impact of hillside aspect (north- vs. south-facing) and a small impact of livestock grazing. The aim of this study was to address the impact of these factors on the poorly studied mid-size aggregate fraction of 1-5 mm as a complementary index of the soil's physical quality. The content and mean weight diameter of this fraction were analyzed by using the same set of soil samples. As a general trend, compared with the widely used aggregation indices, the content of this fraction was found to be more responsive to livestock grazing. Furthermore, both the content and mean weight diameter of this fraction were found to be highly responsive to type of cover. These effects reveal positive relationships between this fraction and the soil's physical quality.
