Nonlinear dynamics in arid and semi-arid systems: Interactions among drivers and processes across scalesWe discuss a new conceptual framework for arid and semi-arid systems that accounts for nonlinear dynamics and cross scale interactions in explaining landscape patterns and dynamics. Our framework includes a spatial and temporal hierarchy, and five key interacting components that connect scales of the hierarchy and generate threshold behaviors: (1) historical legacies that include climate, disturbance, and management regimes, (2) dynamic template of patterns in ecological variables and spatial context, (3) vertical and horizontal transport processes (fluvial, aeolian, animal), (4) rate, direction, and amount of resource redistribution between high and low resource areas, and (5) feedbacks among plants, animals, and soils. We illustrate how this framework can be used to understand, forecast, and manage ecological systems that exhibit nonlinear dynamics across a range of spatial and temporal scales. This paper provides the foundation for a series of papers from the Jornada Experimental Range ARS-LTER research site in southern New Mexico, USA that support this new conceptual framework.
