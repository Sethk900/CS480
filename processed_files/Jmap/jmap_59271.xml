Reservoir Water Allocation under Abrupt Pollution ConditionAbstractA suitable strategy for analyzing a water-resource system reaction to abrupt pollutants and for examining the necessity and the nature of management programs would necessitate quality-quantity modeling of the system and conflict-resolution methods to compromise between contradictory goals and desires. The allocation of drinking and agricultural water of the Karaj dam, one of the most strategic dams in Iran, is accomplished by using the CE-QUAL-W2 simulation model. In this study, an entering coliform pollution with 1013  mpn/m3 intensity is taken into account. In addition, a new conflict-resolution model is developed so that less water allocation is made based on the quality aspects desired. That is, poor quality water is allocated less, whereas more allocation is made along with an increase in the quality utility. Results show that, for abrupt pollution conditions, the developed quality-quantity model is 14% more suitable than the exclusion of water allocation. The present study with its developed methodology can be a guide for decision-makers to extract different reservoir allocations under abrupt pollution conditions.
