Third contribution on Rovno amber silken fungus beetles: a new Eocene species of Cryptophagus (Coleoptera, Clavicornia, Cryptophagidae)Abstract Cryptophagus alexagrestis Lyubarsky & Perkovsky, sp.Â n. is described based on a fossil inclusion in Late Eocene Rovno amber (Ukraine). The new species is similar to the extant Cryptophagus skalitzkyi Reitter and Cryptophagus dilutus Reitter, differing from the latter by having a very transverse, short and dilated 10th antennal segment, and from the former by the very elongate segments of the flagellum.
