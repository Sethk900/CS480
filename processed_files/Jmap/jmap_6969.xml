Creophilus luctuosus (Blanchard) from Bolivia Transferred to the Genus Xanthopygus, with Locality Correction (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae)The species Staphylinus luctuosus Blanchard, 1842 was transferred to the genus Creophilus early in this century, apparently based on comments in the original description, and has not been studied since. Examination of a type (here designated as lectotype) demonstrates that this species does not belong in either of these genera of the subtribe Staphylinina, but instead belongs in the genus Xanthopygus of the subtribe Xanthopygina. Xanthopygus luctuosus NEW COMBINATION is probably a valid species, possibly most closely related to X. max Blackwelder from Peru. Although X. luctuosus is listed only from Brazil in all catalogs, it was originally recorded from Bolivia, and the type locality is here corrected to the area between Chil√≥n and Mataral, Bolivia.
