Some observations on rodent and antelope damage in commercial forest plantationsThe impact of various weeding and site-preparation treatments on Acacia mearnsii and Pinus patula damage by mammalian pests was assessed. Browsing by small antelope on Acacia mearnsii was significantly less in areas where harvesting residues had been retained rather than burned. There was significantly less browsing in weedy areas than in weed-free areas. Rodent damage on Pinus patula increased exponentially with increasing weediness.
