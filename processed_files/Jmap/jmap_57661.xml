Impact of Nanoparticle Silver in a Sequencing Batch Reactor Removing Phosphorus and AmmoniaAbstractThe effect of nanoparticle silver (AgNP) in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) removing phosphorus and ammonia was analyzed. The amount of 500  μg/L of AgNP did not significantly change the soluble chemical oxygen demand or specific oxygen uptake rates during the batch tests. Furthermore, 300  μg/L of AgNP had no effect on phosphorus, ammonia, or chemical oxygen demand removal during continuous dosing. Analysis by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry determined that the lab-scale SBR removed over 80% of influent AgNP during continuous dosing. It was also determined that the North End Water Pollution Control Centre in Winnipeg, Canada, removed just under 50% of influent AgNP, and that half of the reduction occurred before secondary treatment.
