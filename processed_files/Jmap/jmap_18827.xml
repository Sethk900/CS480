Above- and below-ground production of trees and other vegetation on contrasting aspects in western Montana: a case studyAbove-ground net primary production (ANPP=change in biomass+litterfall) and below-ground gross primary production (BGPP) of all vegetation were measured in young (<30 years), paired stands (n=8) on a north and south aspect in western Montana. Stands of high and low overstory leaf area index were compared. ANPP ranged from 1550 to 4400 kg C ha(-1) per year and BGPP ranged from 1360 to 3500 kg C ha(-1) per year. ANPP was related to leaf area index and aspect (p=0.0336 and p=0.0031, respectively), as was BGPP (p=0.0185 and p=0.0016, respectively). ANPP and BGPP were both greater on the north aspect at any given leaf area index (LAI). Above-ground production of the understory was also higher on the north aspect. Litterfall from all vegetation combined represented the largest share of ANPP; increases in overstory biomass represented the next largest share. Soil CO2 flux was also higher on the north aspect. Despite higher overstory LAI on the north aspect, understory NPP was higher. These results confirm that all measures of productivity, both above- and belowground, were higher on the north aspect than on the south aspect. Neither site index nor habitat types reflected the large differences in ANPP and BGPP between aspects. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
