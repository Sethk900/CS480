CARBON-CYCLE DYNAMICS AND SOIL RESPIRATION OF FORESTS UNDER NATURAL DEGRADATION IN THE GRAN-SABANAThe Gran Sabana in Southeastern Venezuela represents a big part of the venezuelan part of the Guayana highlands. The soils of the region, mainly Oxisols, originate from sandstones and are deeply weathered. The content of nutrients (esp. Ca) typically is very low, pH is around 4.5, Al saturation is extremely high (80-90%) and the CEC is very limited (2 mval/100g clay). Our investigation plots are situated on a ridge 1180m asl. The annual precipitation during the investigation period reached 220mm. The dry period lasts three months (Jan. - Mar). Litterfall occurred throughout the year (5.2-7.6 Mg ha-1 yr-1) and followed a moderate seasonal pattern. Soil respiration (8.9-12.2 Mg C ha-1 yr-1) showed a more pronounced seasonal dependency, in which the moisture content of the organic layer and topsoil were the most important regulating factors. Fine root production was 7.4-11.4 Mg ha-1 yr-1 determined in four sampling periods during 14 months. On the basis of the data presented, as well as biomass estimations of Dezzeo (1990), we reach a preliminary estimate of carbon stock and fluxes between the above - and belowground compartments, including an evaluation of the degradation processes.
