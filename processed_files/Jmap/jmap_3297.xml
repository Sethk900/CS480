EFFICACY OF TWO VARIATIONS ON AN AERIAL LEK-COUNT METHOD FOR GREATER SAGE-GROUSEGreater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) is a species of concern, and accurate population data are needed to monitor conservation management efforts. Conventional, ground-based lek counts are labor-intensive, expensive, and have several sources of potential error and bias, including the practical limits on number and distribution of leks counted. We tested aerial methods for photographing Multiple leks during a single morning. We completed 14 aerial approaches to 6 leks in 2 different years using 2 different airplanes and altitudes. Grouse flushed from leks on 12 approaches when the airplane was within 200-300 m of the lek. In 2 instances, strutting grouse crouched and stayed on the lek. Our highest-resolution images increased our confidence in grouse identification but also decreased field-of-view coverage to the detriment of count accuracy The methods we tested do not allow sage-grouse to be accurately Counted, but the results provide information about sage-grouse responses to low-altitude airplane approaches and about useful image resolutions and fields of view
