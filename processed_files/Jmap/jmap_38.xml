Effects of grazing and topography on dust flux and deposition in the Xilingele grassland, Inner Mongolia.The dynamics of dust emission and deposition in the grasslands of Inner Mongolia were investigated during a measuring campaign from April to May 2005 in grazed and un-grazed plots. Both processes are determined by the grazing intensity, whereas dust deposition rates are modified additionally by the topography. Because grazing intensity influences the height and density of the vegetation, it could therefore be measured through the surface roughness length (z0). Almost all strong winds come regularly from the northwest, which give rise to the distinction between exposed windward and mostly sheltered leeward slopes.
