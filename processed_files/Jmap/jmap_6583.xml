Tolerance of almond (Prunus amygdalus) and peach (P. Persica) seedlings to metam-sodiumThe tolerance of 1-year-old almond seedlings (Prunus amygdalus) in a loamy sand, and newly planted peach seedlings (P. persica) in washed river sand to low concentrations of metam-sodium (sodium methyldithiocar- bamate) in the root zone was investigated. Phytotoxic symptoms were observed from 40 mg l−1 active ingredient (a.i.) on both crops but the almonds were more tolerant to higher metam-sodium concentrations. There was no indication of growth suppression, decrease in fresh mass or restricted regrowth of the peach seedlings within the concentration range of 5 to 20 mg l−1.
