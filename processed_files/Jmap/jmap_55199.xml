An improved method for determining Brooks–Corey model parameters from horizontal absorptionLow-cost, simple, rapid and accurate approaches for measuring soil hydraulic properties are of great importance in the application of hydrologic models of the vadose zone. A recently proposed method of constant-saturation absorption (MCSA) for determining Brooks–Corey (BC) model parameters is promising. However, this method has not been tested using experimental data. In this paper, measured soil–water diffusivity or soil–water retention curves (SWRCs) of 20 soil samples were used to test the reliability of MCSA. The results indicate that MCSA consistently estimated soil–water diffusivities by the Bruce and Klute method, but it substantially overestimated air-entry suctions (hd) and thereby soil suction. A new method (MCPA) is proposed herein to overcome the problems associated with MCSA. Using the improved method, estimated SWRCs are consistent with observation. With the estimated soil hydraulic parameters, HYDRUS-1D generated very accurate simulations of the cumulative absorption curves. Compared with direct or other indirect methods, MCPA is a more accurate, low-cost, and simple method, and it is especially useful for rapid determination of SWRC for soil–water movement simulations. However, if unsaturated soil–water diffusivity is of greater concern, our results also indicate that MCSA more accurately predicts this quantity and thus should be preferred.
