Improving the discrimination of vegetation and landform patterns in sandy rangelands: a synergistic approachSoil erosion is a key factor in land degradation processes in the sandy rangelands of the Peninsula Vald√©s of Patagonia, Argentina. Mapping landform and vegetation patterns is important for improving prediction, monitoring and planning of areas threatened by sand and shrub encroachment. This paper investigates the contribution of optical sensors, such as the Terra Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), and textural measures derived from microwave Radarsat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) to their discrimination. An evaluation is undertaken to compare the classification accuracy achieved by specific regions of the spectrum and their synergistic use in an object‚Äoriented approach. Image segmentation and object‚Äoriented classifications were applied to the datasets. This required defining appropriate fuzzy membership functions for characterizing active and stabilized lineal dunes and the main vegetation classes. Improvements in the discrimination of active and stabilized dunes (vegetated by either scrub or grass) were achieved by using an object‚Äoriented classification that integrated microwave and visible near‚Äinfrared (NIR) data. Changes in surface roughness caused by different vegetation types stabilizing the dunes affected the radar backscattering. Whereas Radarsat enabled a clear separation of scrub‚Ästabilized dunes, Terra‚ÄASTER showed superior performance in the cartography of grass‚Ästabilized dunes. The synergistic use of microwave and visible and near‚Äinfrared (VNIR) data yielded a substantial increase in the discrimination and mapping of landform/vegetation patterns.
