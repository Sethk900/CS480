Anisakis simplex complex (Nematoda: Anisakidae) in zooplankton communities from temperate NE Atlantic watersThe euphausiid Nyctiphanes couchii and an unidentified mysid have been found, for the first time, with third-stage larvae (L3) of the Anisakis simplex complex in the mesozooplanktonic community of the coastal upwelling system in Galicia (NW Spain). Parasite larvae were molecularly identified using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. The prevalence of these parasites in the euphausiid population was 0.0019%. The existence of parasites in a variety of mesozooplankton organisms suggests that the transmission routes of A. simplex sensu stricto and A. pegrefii are wider than expected. The results suggest that these two Anisakis species are not specific to their intermediate hosts. Finally, the recruitment of A. simplex complex may be affected by oceanography, differing under upwelling or downwelling conditions.
