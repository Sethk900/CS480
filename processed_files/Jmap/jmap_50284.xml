Two species of Naididae (Annelida, Clitellata) from southern Tibet, ChinaAbstract One new species of Naidinae (Oligochaeta, Naididae), Nais badia sp. n. and one new record species from China, Tubifex montanus Kowalewski, 1919 (Tubificinae) are found in southern Tibet. The new species is distinguished from congeners by its large area of reddish brown pigment in the anterior segments I–VIII, serrate hairs, pectinate needles with 1–2 intermediate teeth, ventral chaetae partly with 1–2 fine intermediate teeth and wave-like movements. The new material of the species Tubifex montanus differs slightly from the previous descriptions by its vas deferens entering atrium subapically, wide ental end of penial sheath and smooth hair chaetae.
