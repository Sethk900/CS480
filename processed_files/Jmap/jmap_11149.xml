Efficacy of aerial telemetry as an aid to capturing specific individualsâ€”a comparison of 2 techniquesLong-term investigations of wild ungulates often dictate that telemetry collars on specific individuals be replaced. We described and evaluated the use of aerial telemetry to facilitate recapture of individual ungulates. Capture of marked animals was much more efficient using fixed-wing telemetry when compared to helicopter telemetry. Total time to capture (P=0.012) and pursuit time (P=0.002) differed significantly, but no difference (P=0.434) in body temperature of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) occurred at time of capture. Application of fixed-wing telemetry during net-gun captures of ungulates resulted in greater safety for capture crews and study animals and in potentially substantial monetary savings.
