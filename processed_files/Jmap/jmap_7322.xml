Componentes y variaciones num√©ricas en una comunidad submontana andina de peque√±os mam√≠feros venezolanosResults of a series of bimensual trappings done from April 1976 to June 1977 plus three other trappings done in 1978 and 1979, in a forested area of the Venezuelan andean piedmont. The non‚Ävolant small mammal community is composed of five species of marsupials and of seven species of rodents. Among the marsupials the most common species was Didelphis marsupialis, among the rodents Proechimys semispinosus which represented a 67% of total captures. A strong fluctuation was registered in the relative abundance of all the different trappings. A correlation between this numerical fluctuation and annual rainfall was found.
