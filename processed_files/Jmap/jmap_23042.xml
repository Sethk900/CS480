Revision of the genera Hovadelium Ardoin and Mimolaena Ardoin (Coleoptera, Tenebrionidae, Laenini) from Madagascar, with remarks on tribal assignment1Abstract The genera Hovadelium Ardoin, 1961 and Mimolaena Ardoin, 1961, endemic in Madagascar, are revised and assigned to the tribe Laenini Seidlitz, 1896 (subfamily Lagriinae Latreille, 1825). New species: Hovadelium ardoini sp. n., Hovadelium bremeri sp. n. and Mimolaena janaki sp. n. An identification key is compiled for all taxa. Distribution of Hovadelium (5 species) and Mimolaena (3 species) is mapped. The congeners might be indicator species for the highly endangered mature forests in Madagascar.
