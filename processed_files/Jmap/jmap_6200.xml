Association of a stem rust resistance gene (Sr45) and two Russian wheat aphid resistance genes (Dn5 and Dn7) with mapped structural loci in common wheatA stem rust resistance gene, originally derived from Triticum tauschii accession RL5289 and present in the germplasm line 87M66-2-1, is here designated Sr45. Sr45 was found to be closely linked to Sr33 (9 ± 1.9 map units) and the centromere (21 ± 3.4 map units) on chromosome arm 1DS. Sr45 is believed to be the same gene as SrX. The Russian wheat aphid resistance gene, Dn5, was loosely linked (32 ± 5 map units) to Ep-D1b, which occurs on a translocation derived from T. ventricosum, and to the cn?D1 locus (37 ± 6.3 map units) on chromosome arm 7DL. Dn5 derives from T. aestivum accession Pl294994 which was found to express two novel Ep-1 alleles (proposed designations Ep-A1d and Ep-D1e). A gene (here designated Dn7) for Russian wheat aphid resistance that was derived from the rye accession, Turkey 77', mapped 14.5 ± 3.9 map units from Lr26 on the 1BL.1RS translocation.
