Oil Content and Fatty Acid Components of Oilseed Flax under Different Environments in ChinaThe oil content and fatty acid compositions of 12 oilseed flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) genotypes (G), selected from 500 G, with high linolenic acid (LIN), were grown under six ecological environments (E) in China. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with three replications. The oil content ranged from 36.71 to 41.93% with a mean value of 39.37%. The genotype FX-16 (41.93%) had the highest oil content. Among all stations, Zhangbei Research Station had the highest oil content (41.32%). Zhangya 2 had the highest LIN (55.33%), which was followed by STS (51.85%) and TY-58 (51.20%). Zhangbei Research Station had the highest LIN (55.16%) followed by Yili Research Station (53.43%). The oil content was positively correlated with linoleic acid (LIO) and LIN, whereas it was negatively associated with palmitic (PAL), stearic (STE), and oleic (OLE) acid. Palmitic acid was negatively correlated with LIO and LIN. These results suggested that E factors (i.e., combinations of diurnal temperature fluctuations, sunshine duration, illumination intensity, rainfall, wind, humidity) strongly influenced the fatty acid composition of different G of oilseed flax. There is a strong G Ã— E interaction for the fatty acid composition.
