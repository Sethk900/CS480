Propagation of a Long-Lived and Threatened Prairie Plant, Lupinus sulphureus ssp. kincaidiiWillamette Valley upland prairie in western Oregon, U.S.A. has been severely degraded and fragmented in the past 150 years after European settlement, resulting in vast population reductions of endemic species. Icaricia icarioides fenderi (Fender's blue butterfly) and Lupinus sulphureus ssp. kincaidii (Kincaid's lupine) are federally listed as Endangered and Threatened Species, respectively. Both are Willamette Valley upland prairie endemics, and Kincaid's lupine is the primary host plant for the Fender's blue butterfly. Attempts to grow Kincaid's lupine have been partially successful in a greenhouse situation; however, propagating plants from field-sown seed can be tenuous and plant establishment is unpredictable. Kincaid's lupine seeds were planted in the fall 1997 at two different upland prairie sites, and the cohort was followed through the summer 2000. Based on cohort tables the most vulnerable life stages to mortality are the germinant stage and the first growing year. Mechanical scarification of Kincaid's lupine seeds yielded no significant differences in survivorship, maternal function, plant size, and the percentage of seeds germinated compared with unscarified seeds. Differential seed source performance detected at one planting site suggests that underlying differences in population genetics may affect Kincaid's lupine vigor, fitness, and establishment. Future restoration projects for Kincaid's lupine should focus on upland prairie sites with naturally occurring lupine populations because local ecological conditions are favorable for lupine establishment. Moreover, the addition of new individuals to small Kincaid's lupine colonies will buffer against the effects of inbreeding depression and increase the site carrying capacity for Fender's blue butterfly.
