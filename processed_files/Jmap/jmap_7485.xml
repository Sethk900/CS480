Fluctuaciones anuales de la meiofauna en la marisma de chinquihue (puerto montt, chile)Summary Annual fluctuations of the meiofauna in the Chinquihue marsh (Puerto Montt, Chile) During the year 1973 a meiofaunistic study was carried out in a southern Chilean marsh (Chinquihue, Puerto Montt, 41° 32’ S; 73° 02’ W). Through monthly samplings in a series of intertidal stations the meiofaunal density and its annual oscillations was determined. The vertical and horizontal distribution and the incidence of the main meiofaunistic groups were also obtained. The most abundant and evenly represented group was Nematoda. The highest values of density were present during summer and the lowest, during winter. In spring and summer the meiofauna is concentrated chiefly in the superficial layer of the bottom. In winter a slight migration of the meiofauna from the upper to the deeper layers of the substrate was detected. For any intertidal level it was found that the superficial strates, 0–1 and 1–2 cm, were more populated than the deeper ones. The most probable causes responsible for the seasonal fluctuations of meiofaunistic density are discussed.
