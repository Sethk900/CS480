Centaurea solstitialis Invasion Success Is Influenced by Nassella pulchra Size.Replacement of perennial grasses with non-native annual grasses in California's Central Valley grasslands and foothills has increased deep soil water availability. Yellow starthistle (<em>Centaurea solstitialis</em>), a deep-rooted invasive thistle, can use this water to invade annual grasslands. Native perennial bunchgrasses, such as Purple needlegrass (<em>Nassella pulchra</em>), also use deep soil water, so there is an overlap in resource use between <em>N. pulchra</em> and <em>C. solstitialis</em>. Restoration of <em>N. pulchra</em> to annual grasslands could result in strong competitive interactions between <em>N. pulchra</em> and <em>C. solstitialis</em>, which may reduce survival, growth, and reproduction of the invader. The strength of this competitive interaction can increase as <em>N. pulchra</em> plants mature, increase in size, and develop more extensive root systems. We studied how the size of <em>N. pulchra</em> affected the success of <em>C. solstitialis</em> invasion over 2 years. We allowed <em>C. solstitialis</em> seed to fall naturally into plots containing <em>N. pulchra</em> plants. For each plot, we measured the number of <em>C. solstitialis</em> seedlings and mature plants, as well as <em>C. solstitialis</em> biomass and seedhead production. In both years of the study, <em>C. solstitialis</em> number, biomass, and seedhead production declined significantly as <em>N. pulchra</em> size increased. However, even <em>C. solstitialis</em> grown with the largest <em>N. pulchra</em> plants produced some seed, especially during the higher rainfall year. We conclude that restoration plantings with larger, established <em>N. pulchra</em> plants will be more resistant to invasion by <em>C. solstitialis</em> than young <em>N. pulchra</em> plantings, but site management must continue as long as a <em>C. solstitialis</em> seed source is present.
