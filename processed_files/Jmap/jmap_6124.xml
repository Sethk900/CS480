Long Valley Community Bioregional AtlasThe Long Valley Bioregional Atlas was prepared by University of Idaho graduate students in the Bioregional Planning and Community Design program in collaboration with the University of Idaho Extension. A key component of the Bioregional Planning program is partnering students and faculty with Idaho communities through â€œLearning and Practice Collaboratives (LPCs)â€ to create healthy and attractive places to live through sustainable land use planning. The LPCs give students hands-on planning experience, while providing communities with a team of people to address community planning issues. During the first semester in the program, students are introduced to the LPC community they will be working with during their time in the program. In addition to exploring the history of the community, visiting the region, and meeting with key community leaders, students develop a bioregional atlas, which gives them a comprehensive picture of the communities and region where they will be working. A bioregional planning approach examines regions from a geographic perspective, such as a valley or watershed, rather than from political jurisdictions, and it incorporates political, historic, economic, and cultural knowledge to arrive at solutions that respond more effectively to the limits and potentials of a region. The Long Valley Bioregional Atlas is the second atlas produced by students in the Bioregional Planning program. The first was the Coeur dâ€™Alene Reservation Community Bioregional Atlas. For this atlas, the bioregion was defined by the Long Valley, a geographic region bounded on the west and east sides by mountain ranges, and on the north by the ridge between Adams and Valley County, and on the south by Round Valley. The atlas contains a wide range of information for the Long Valley bioregion including: biophysical elements, history, culture, community life, the legal and political context, housing, health and medical, demographics, education, economics, infrastructure, and transportation. Throughout the data collection process, students learned a great deal about the Long Valley bioregion. This information will be applicable to the LPC planning projects students will be working on with community members during the remainder of their time in the planning program. It is our hope that the community will find this atlas a useful resource providing access to a wealth of information about the region in one place.
