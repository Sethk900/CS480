Integrated Salt and Water Balance Modeling for the Management of Waterlogging and Salinization. II: Application of SAHYSMODAbstractWaterlogging and soil salinization are the twin menaces of canal-irrigated areas located in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. An integrated spatial agro-hydro-salinity model, SAHYSMOD, was applied to analyze water and salt balances of an irrigated semi-arid area located in Haryana, India, where the groundwater level is rising continuously. The model was validated with the observed groundwater level and salinity data. The impact of various water management scenarios on the groundwater levels has been analyzed through the model. The study revealed that, on average, the water table is rising under the existing conditions, although at a slow rate. To prevent the area from further salinization, some recommendations have been made: change the cropping pattern with reduced rice area; increase the groundwater abstraction, and line the surface irrigation systems. It was concluded from the analysis of various scenarios that simultaneously implementing multiple approaches is more effective in controlling waterlogging problems than individual interventions.
