Experimental Study of the Stage-Discharge Relationship for an Upstream Inclined Grid with Longitudinal BarsAbstractIn this paper, the outflow process of an upstream inclined grid with longitudinal bars is studied by using the dimensional analysis and the incomplete self-similarity theory. Next, the theoretical analysis shows that a power equation can be used for establishing the stage-discharge equation. The coefficient and an exponent of the power equation depend on the slope angle and the void ratio. Finally, this new stage discharge is tested by using measurements obtained by laboratory runs conducted in this investigation.
