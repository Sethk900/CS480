Long-term measurements of CO2 flux and evapotranspiration in a Chihuahuan desert grasslandWe measured CO2 and evapotranspiration (ET) fluxes above a Chihuahuan desert grassland from 1996 through 2001. Averaged across six years, this ecosystem was a source (positive flux) of CO2 in every month. Over that period, sustained periods of carbon uptake (negative flux) were rare. Averaged across all months, we estimated that CO, was being released into the atmosphere at a rate of + 1.5g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) (+0.40g Cm(-2)d(-1)) or divided by 533g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1) (+ 145.3 g Cm-2 yr(-1)). Average ET was 299 min yr(-1) with a monthly range of 0.15 mm d(-1) in December to 2.15 mm d(-1) in August. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
