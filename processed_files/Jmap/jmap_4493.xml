A canning quality model for small white bean lines selected for breeding (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)The study aimed to validate canonical variate analysis (CVA) model equations for the grouping of small white beans according to canning quality by testing them on four cultivar samples of known canning quality (2000/01 season), and 24 breeding samples that were not included in the development of the model, from three localities (2002/03 season). The model was not sensitive enough to classify cultivars into canning grades, but could serve as a rapid means to identify cultivar groupings based on canning quality without the use of 95% confidence circles. The CVA on breeding samples and the model identified the same entries not to be significantly different (P>0.05) from Teebus (reference cultivar) in canning quality. The model was therefore able to predict the average canning quality of dry bean entries not included in the original model over localities. It was also successfully applied to indicate the entry Ã— locality interactions, thus enabling the identification of entries with stability over localities. The model eliminates the need for performing CVA, while it allows the determination of canning quality by using only visual appearance, hydration coefficient, splits and size for the evaluation.
