Descriptions of two new species of the Purana abdominalis species group (Hemiptera: Cicadidae: Cicadini) from the Philippines, with a key to the species groups of PuranaThe Purana abdominalis species group is proposed within the genus Purana Distant, which includes two new species, Purana abdominalis Lee, sp. nov. and Purana nana Lee, sp. nov., from the Philippines. Classification of species groups of the genus Purana is discussed. The genus Formosemia Matsumura, 1917 is resurrected from the junior synonymy with Purana Distant, 1905. Purana apicalis (Matsumura) is transferred to Formosemia stat. rev. to become Formosemia apicalis (Matsumura) comb. nov. A key to the species groups of Purana is provided.
