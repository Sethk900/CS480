Brown bear (Ursus arctos L.) habitat use patterns in two regions of northern Pindos, Greece â€“ management implicationsConservation of brown bear (Ursus arctos L.) depends upon protecting the species' core habitat and mitigating the detrimental consequences of infrastructure. Therefore, a detailed knowledge of bear habitat suitability is needed. Two sites were systematically surveyed in Pindos (Gramos and Grevena) for bear signs. Additionally, in Gramos six individuals were monitored with conventional VHF telemetry; and in Grevena a further six individuals were monitored with GPSâ€Simplex collars. The aim was to analyse the habitat preference of bears within their home ranges, and construct habitat suitability maps, using Ecological Niche Factor Analysis. Despite individual behavioural differences of bears and intrinsic differences between the sites, the two regional population units exhibit similar habitat preferences. The bears prefer agricultural land and areas near the edge between forests and open landscape formations (grasslands, cultivated fields, fallow land). Bears use alpine meadows less than randomly expected. Our results were used in zoning proposals for Gramos and for improvement of mitigation measures of Via Egnatia highway stretch in Grevena.
