The life of Cyclocephala celata Dechambre, 1980 (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Dynastinae) in captivity with descriptions of the immature stagesWe collected 76 specimens of the Cyclocephala celata Dechambre in Igarassu, Pernambuco, Brazil, in March 2008 for captive breeding and rearing to document its life cycle and to describe the immatures. A total of 98 eggs was obtained from captive-reared insects, each individually enclosed in an egg chamber assembled with the surrounding substrate. Viability was highest in the egg phase (92.8%). Pupae were enclosed in pupal cells. The duration of the life cycle was 164 days (n = 2), and only 2% of the eggs developed into adults. Third instar characters documented for the first time in the genus are: epitorma on the epipharynx, three dorsolongitudinal striae on the right mandible and one fringe of setae on the hypopharynx. Our data support the possibility of captive rearing and breeding of C. celata, contributing to the formulation of accurate management and conservation plans for native pollinators.
