A contribution to the taxonomy, cytogenetics and reproductive biology of the genus Aclerda Signoret (Homoptera, Coccinea, Aclerdidae)A new species of scale insects, Aclerda pseudozoysiae sp. n., is described and illustrated. The karyotypes and some aspects of reproductive biology and cytogenetics of the new species species and Aclerda takahashiiKuwana, 1932 were studied, representing the first data for the genus Aclerda Signoret, 1874 and the family Aclerdidae as a whole. Aclerda pseudozoysiae sp. n. has 2n=16, bisexual reproduction, and heterochromatinization of one haploid set of chromosomes in male stages of the life cycle, matching either a Lecanoid or a Comstockioid genetic system. Aclerda takahashii demonstrates 2n=18 and unusual type of parthenogenesis with diploid and haploid embryos (inside each gravid female) without heterochromatinization. Both species are ovoviviparous; all stages of embryonic development occur inside the motherâ€™s body.
