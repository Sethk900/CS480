Growth Rate of the Rock-Boring Clam Penitella Penita (Conrad 1837) in Relation to Hardness of Rock and Other FactorsThe morphology and the growth rate of three populations of Penitella penita from substrata of different hardness were studied. Morphology differed significantly, the valves being delicate and elongate in the soft rock and heavy and tumid in he hard rock. The rate of growth decreased as the hardness of the substratum increased. Evidence is presented which suggests that these differences are not genetically controlled but are induced by the relative hardness of the substratum. Growth rate is dependent both on the width of growth bands and on the frequency with which these are deposited. The width of the growth band deposited during the shell deposition period is determined by the amount that the animal was able to enlarge its burrow during the preceding period of active boring. Growth band width increases with age and decreases with harder substrata. The duration of the growth interval increases with age and probably also with decreased availability of food.
