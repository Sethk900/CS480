(Nematoda, Dorylaimida, Qudsianematidae), an interesting species from IranAbstract A new species of the genus Crassolabium, Crassolabium persicum sp. n., collected from Arasbaran rangelands of Iran, is described and illustrated. It is characterized by its body 1.92–2.40 mm long, lip region offset by constriction and 17–19 μm wide, odontostyle 16–19 μm long with aperture occupying less than one–third (27–30%) its length, neck 428–690 μm long, pharyngeal expansion 369–390 μm long or occupying 54–56% of total neck length, female genital system amphidelphic, uterus bipartite and 162–218 μm long or 2.3–3.5 times as long as body diameter, pars refringens vaginae well developed, V = 54–57.5, vulva longitudinal, prerectum bearing a blind sac, tail conical with rounded tip to conoid (25–36 μm, c=60–69, c’=0.5–0.9), spicules 68–72 μm long, precloacal pair of supplements far (22–27 μm) from cloacal aperture, and 13–17 shortly spaced ventromedian supplements with hiatus. The new taxon is compared in depth to its relatives in Crassolabium as well as other similar species of Aporcelaimellus and Amblydorylaimus.
