Hydrozetes longisetosus sp. nov. (Acari: Oribatida: Hydrozetidae) â€“ the most primitive European species of Hydrozetes from PolandThe larva, nymphal stages and adult of Hydrozetes longisetosus sp. nov. are described and illustrated, and the relationship of this species with the other European species of Hydrozetes is investigated. This species was first found at the edge of a forest lake, Dury 3, in the Tuchola Forest (Poland). Subsequently, we studied specimens that had been collected in 1976 by Dr H.M. Engelmann 40Â km north of GÃ¶rlitz Niederspree (Germany). Many adults of this species have three setae of the câ€series, which is rare in Hydrozetes and is considered a primitive character. Most adults have two pairs of pâ€series setae, which is not common in Brachypylina and is unique among European Hydrozetes. The nymphal stages have many long setae in the marginal part of the gastronotum (whole lâ€ and hâ€series and seta p 1), and some or all long setae of the câ€ and dâ€series, which is unique among European Hydrozetes. In H. longisetosus neotrichy occurs in the hâ€series, as in H. parisiensis Grandjean, 1948. Therefore, the former species is closely related to the latter, and also to H. lacustris (Michael, 1882) and H. octosetosus Willmann, 1932, which rarely retain all the câ€series setae in the adults.
