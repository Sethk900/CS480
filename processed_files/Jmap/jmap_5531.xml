Gonopod segmentation and the Australian centipede Prionopodella (Chilopoda): testing a basal position in the ScutigeromorphaThe monotypic centipede genus Prionopodella Verhoeff, 1925 has until now been known only from the types of its type species, collected in Queensland, Australia, nearly a century ago. The female gonopods of Prionopodella were described as having a uniquely tripartite structure, viewed as primitive relative to the bipartite gonopod of all other Scutigeromorpha. An articulation in the syntelopodite is present in one syntype, but new specimens from central eastern Queensland show an, at most, incompletely jointed or entirely unjointed syntelopodite, as in other scutigeromorphs. Cladistic analysis of morphological characters including Prionopodella and the likewise monotypic Australian genus Prothereua Verhoeff, 1925, shows Prionopodella to nest within Thereuoneminae, allied to other Asian/Australian genera, rather than in a basal position within Scutigeromorpha as is implied by Verhoeff's theory about primitive gonopod structure.
