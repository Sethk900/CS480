Natural prey of the crab spider Thomisus onustus (Araneae: Thomisidae), an extremely powerful predator of insectsThe natural prey of the crab spider Thomisus onustus inhabiting Eryngium plants was studied in the Absheron Peninsula, Azerbaijan. The total percentage of specimens of T. onustus found while feeding was low (9.1%). However, solitary late instar and adult females exhibited a very high feeding percentage (29.9%). Other sexâ€“age groups of T. onustus, including small juveniles, adult males, and females guarding egg sacs, were found feeding significantly less frequently. Investigation has shown that T. onustus is a polyphagous predator, with representatives of four arthropod orders found in its diet. The primary food of T. onustus was Diptera and Hymenoptera, which collectively accounted for 94.2% of total prey. Worker ants constituted about oneâ€fifth of the prey, suggesting that T. onustus is a myrmecophagic spider. The length of prey killed by T. onustus ranged between 1.25 and 16.00Â mm (mean 6.21Â mm) and constituted from 34.4 to 587.9% (mean 194.9%) of length of their captors. The most frequently captured were large arthropods, exceeding the size of the spiders (83.1%). Small and mediumâ€sized juveniles captured considerably larger prey (in terms of preyâ€“predator length ratio) than late instar and adult females. Over half of their prey constituted arthropods more than twoâ€fold larger than the spiders.
