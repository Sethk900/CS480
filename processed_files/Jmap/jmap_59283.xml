Simulation and Optimization Modeling for the Management of Groundwater Resources. I: Distinct ApplicationsAbstractThe management of groundwater resources is a critical issue against the backdrop of the increasing water demand for agricultural, industrial, and domestic uses and dwindling water resources. Various simulation and optimization approaches have been used to solve the groundwater management problems. This paper presents an overview of the simulation and optimization modeling approaches used in groundwater resources conservation and management. The main objective of this review is to analyze simulation and optimization modeling approaches and to provide an assessment of their applications reported in literature. Conclusions are provided based on this evaluation, which could be useful for system managers and planners for selecting the suitable modeling approach for their specific uses.
