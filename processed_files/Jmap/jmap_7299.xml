Behavioral and ecological observations of Peruvian High‚ÄAndean Pierid butterflies (Lepidoptera)Four species of Pieridae were studied above 4000 m in the Andes of Arequipa and Jun√≠n, Per√∫. Phulia nymphula is widely distributed over several habitats. Pierphulia rosea annamariea occurs on talus and bare soil near bogs. Infraphulia madeleinea and Phulia garleppi appear to be limited to peat bogs. Thermoregulatory and sexual behaviors are described for these species. In addition, distributional and behavioral data on several species of Peruvian Tatochila are presented.
