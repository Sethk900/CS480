Supersaturations, microphysics and nitric acid partitioning in a cold cirrus cloud observed during CR-AVE 2006: an observationâ€“modelling intercomparison studySupersaturations, microphysics and nitric acid partitioning in a very cold subvisible tropical cirrus cloud observed on 2 February 2006, during the field campaign CR-AVE, are studied by comparing a simulated set of possible cloud development scenarios with the in situ observations. The scenario that best matches the observations is a cirrus cloud forming by heterogeneous freezing of a small number of ice nuclei with subsequent unimpeded mass accommodation of water on ice. Variation of the freezing process, the accommodation coefficient or the amount of available water leads to simulated clouds that differ microphysically from the observed cloud in important respects. In particular, the simulations suggest that heterogeneous ice nucleation or another freezing mechanism producing only a low number of ice crystals could be an important process for cold cirrus cloud formation, possibly explaining the frequent observations of high supersaturations inside the cirrus cloud in this temperature regime.
