Sage Grouse Flock Characteristics and Habitat Selection in WinterSage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) were studied in North Park, Colorado, during the winters of 1973-74 and 1974-75. Distribution was plotted from sightings of 199 flocks and 17 single birds, totaling 5,080 grouse. Only 50 percent of the 1,252 km' of lands dominated by sagebrush (Artemi- sia spp.) sustained winter use by grouse because of snow depth, steepness of slope, and sagebrush dis- turbance. Nearly 80 percent of the use occurred in 7 areas comprising less than 7 percent of the total area. Sexes segregated; males formed more unisexual flocks. Flocks were the dominant social unit and con- tained less than 50 individuals in 88 percent of all observations. Flocks containing more than 50 percent females were larger than male flocks and used denser sagebrush stands for feeding and loafing. Roosting and feeding sites had similar vegetal and physical characteristics. Sixty-six percent of flocks were on slopes less than 5 percent, and only 13 percent were on slopes greater than 10 percent. Sixty-two percent of 2,350 grouse in 1973-74 and 61 percent of 1,984 grouse in 1974-75 were females
