Annual fluctuations of the subtidal macroinfauna in an Estuary of South of ChileAbstract Monthly samples taken at two separate stations in the Queule River Estuary, between May 1980 and April 1981, were used to study annual fluctuations of the subtidal macroinfauna. In both stations, the macroinfauna showed a seasonal trend towards maximum densities and biomass in summer or autumn, with minimum densities during winter sampling, when salinities of bottom waters were the lowest. Annual variations of sedimentological characteristics did not show a direct relation with the seasonal trends presented by density and biomass. In station A (muddy sand substrate), the overall mean density of macroinfauna was 294.7 individuals per 0.025 m2, while in station B (sandy bottom) it was 33.4 animals per 0.025 m2. In the first station the overall mean biomass was 103.27 mg per 0.025 m2, while in the second it was 7.71 mg per 0.025 m2. Two polychaetes, Minuspio chilensis Foster (Spionidae) and Perinereis gualpensis Jeldes (Nereidae) and two amphipods, Paracorophium chilensis Varela (Corophidae) and Cheus sp Thurston (Cheidae) were the species represented throughout all the year. The first three taxa presented higher density and biomass values in the muddy sand habitat, while Cheus sp. had higher values in the sandy bottom of station B.
