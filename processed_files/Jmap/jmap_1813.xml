Climate change can alter competitive relationships between resident and migratory birds.<ol><li>Climate change could affect resource competition between resident and migratory bird species by changing the interval between their onsets of breeding or by altering their population densities.</li><li>We studied interspecific nest-hole competition between resident great tits and migrant pied flycatchers in South-Western Finland over the past five decades (1953-2005).</li><li>We found that appearance of fatal take-over trials, the cases where a pied flycatcher tried to take over a great tit nest but was killed by the tit, increased with a reduced interspecific laying date interval and with increasing densities of both tits and flycatchers. The probability of pied flycatchers taking over great tit nests increased with the density of pied flycatchers.</li><li>Laying dates of the great tit and pied flycatcher are affected by the temperatures of different time periods, and divergent changes in these temperatures could consequently modify their competitive interactions. Densities are a result of reproductive success and survival, which can be affected by separate climatic factors in the resident great tit and trans-Saharan migrant pied flycatcher.</li><li>On these bases we conclude that climate change has a great potential to alter the competitive balance between these two species.</li></ol>
