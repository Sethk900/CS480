Frequency and variability of missing tree rings along the stems of Pinus halepensis and Pinus pinea from a semiarid site in SE Spain.We studied the occurrence of missing rings (MR) around and along the stems of three Pinus halepensis and three Pinus pinea trees growing in a semiarid Mediterranean site in SE Spain. Tree-ring analyses were performed along 8 radii on stem discs taken at 1 m distances from the base to the top of the trees. The tree rings analysed showed that 19% were missing in P. halepensis and 10% in P. pinea. MR were recorded in 61% of P. halepensis and 24% of P. pinea in the years analysed. Dry conditions from January to May and high late winter to spring temperatures seem to be the main climatic elements promoting MR in both species. In our research into P. halepensis, the frequency of MR gradually decreased from the bottom upward, but no such pattern was observed in P. pinea. Most tree rings were missing only locally (LMR), indicating that wood formation occurred every year in at least some part of a tree, and the tree rings were often discontinuous around and along the stem. Since the frequency of LMR greatly varies around and along the stem, our results suggest that serial sectioning along the stem provides more information on wood formation and responses of trees to environment than studying the samples at breast height only. The disadvantage of the technique is that, as in our study case, research is based on a limited sample size, since it requires destructive sampling with tree felling, which is not usually possible or desirable on highly vulnerable semiarid forest ecosystems.
