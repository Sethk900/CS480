Treatment of Energetic Wastewater Containing 2,4-Dinitroanisole and N-Methyl Paranitro AnilineAbstractThe U.S. Army is seeking to produce safer, less sensitive munitions through the addition of two new energetics, 2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN) and N-methyl paranitro aniline (MNA), to the munitionsâ€™ formula. Production of these munitions would add them to the waste stream. The use of an anaerobic fluidized-bed bioreactor (AFBB) was studied for treating these compounds in a simulated wastewater with ethanol as the electron donor. The reactor degraded both of the compounds to below detection limits over a wide range of ethanol concentrations. The degradation was found to be a transformation into secondary products for both energetics: diaminoanisole (for DNAN) and N-methyl-p-phenylenediamine (for MNA). Both of these by-products reacted upon exposure to air, forming azobond dimers. Potassium perchlorate was added to the feed stream to test if additional energetics would disrupt the transformation. The AFBB continued transformation and was able to remove the perchlorate after a two week acclimation period. The AFBB was an effective treatment method for DNAN and MNA, but further study is required to investigate the transformation products more thoroughly.
