Optimizing the Use of Land and Water Resources for Maximizing Farm Income by Mitigating the Hydrological ImbalancesAbstractThis study presents the formulation and application of a linear programming model for the maximization of net annual farm income from an area located in the Rohtak district of Haryana, India. A groundwater balance constraint was imposed on the model, which mitigates the waterlogging problem of the area, while making an optimal allocation of land and water resources. The model results showed a reduction in rice, gram, barley, and mustard areas against an increase in wheat, cotton, and sugarcane under optimal conditions. Under the optimal land and water allocation, groundwater use is increased while canal allocation is decreased. The net annual farm income from the command area has increased by about 26% under optimal allocations. The sensitivity analysis of the model parameters showed that a better price of crops is the most sensitive parameter, followed by the crop area and cost of cultivation. State agencies and farmers involved in the actual agricultural production process are advised to practice conjunctive use of canal water and groundwater for maximizing their farm income. This strategy would also mitigate hydrological imbalances in the groundwater system without installing expensive drainage systems, which is not feasible because the groundwater quality is poor and drainage water may pose a serious disposal problem.
