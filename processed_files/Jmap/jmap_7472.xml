Wissenschaftliche ergebnisse der Peruâ€expedition Dr. K. H. LÃ¼ling 1972 Weitere Ã¶kologische beobachtungen am biotop des rivulus beniensis (Pisces, cyprinodontidae) bei Tingo Maria (Peru)Summary Additional information on a population of Rivulus beniensis living in small ditches near Tingo Maria (Peru), that has been dealt with in detail by Liiling (1971b), is provided. While normally the habitat of the fish falls dry after spawning, this had not been the case in 1971, due to unusual meteorological conditions (table). Still, the fish were numerous in April/May 1972, indicating, that a dry period is not vital to the eggs of these Rivulus beniensis, and this apparently applies to most of the other species of Rivulus, which may behave like seasonal fish, but are not dependent on a dry period in the egg stage.
