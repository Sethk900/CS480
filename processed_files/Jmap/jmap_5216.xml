Taxonomic revision of the Hydroporus bodemeyeri species complex (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae) with a geometric morphometric analysis of body shape within the groupThe eastern Mediterranean Hydroporus bodemeyeri species complex, which so far includes three species, H. bodemeyeri Ganglbauer, 1900, Hydroporus anatolicus J.Balfour-Browne, 1963 and Hydroporus cuprescens Fery and Miller, 1995, is revised. Three new taxa are described: H. anatolicus koksali ssp. nov. from north-eastern Turkey, H. bodemeyeri cariaensis ssp. nov. from south-western Turkey and Rhodes, and Hydroporus kurdistanicus sp. nov. from south-eastern Turkey. Hydroporus guignoti Gschwendtner, 1935 described from Albania and Greece and previously regarded as a synonym of H. bodemeyeri, is treated as a distinct subspecies H. bodemeyeri guignoti stat. nov. A geometric morphometric analysis of body shape within the complex is presented, which confirms the separate status of all recognized taxa, with considerable overlapping between the subspecies of H. anatolicus and H. bodemeyeri. We provide an initial hypothesis on the origin of the contemporary distribution of H. bodemeyeri and H. cuprescens, assuming their vicariant diversification from an Anatolian ancestor.
