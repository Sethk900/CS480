Redescription of Eimeria centrocerci from Sage Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus)Eimeria centrocerci was found in the droppings from two of 153 sage grouse, Centrocercus urophasianus, from Moffat County, Colorado. Because Simon's (1939, 1940) figures are not clear and the description is ambiguous, a redescription of E. centrocerci from the sage grouse is presented.
