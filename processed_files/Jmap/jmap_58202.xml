Ecohydrology and Hydrologic Engineering: Regulation of Hydrology-Biota Interactions for SustainabilityAbstractIn the context of global environmental and social change, with increasing pollution and decline of biodiversity of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems having its deep roots in drastic modifications to hydrological mesocycles, there is an urgent need for a new approach for sustainability. The two often contradicting approaches to water resources management, i.e., (1) hydrotechnical, and (2) ecological, can be reconciled within the context of ecohydrology (EH). It seeks for the understanding of the underlying water-biota interactions as well as providing a new tool for management of water resources. While the majority of changes are nonreversible in the framework of ecohydrology it is possible to regulate (dual regulation) the processes, especially in novel ecosystems, as an alternative to conservation and restoration measures, in order to increase their carrying capacity in the four dimensions, as follows: (1) water resources, (2) biodiversity, (3) ecosystem services, and (4) resilience. The proposed approach aims to initiate a discussion and joint efforts of hydrological engineers, hydrologists, and ecologists towards formulation of the comprehensive strategy and scientific background for harmonization of society needs with the enhanced ecosystem potential. It stipulates for a change in paradigm not only in the environmental sciences but also in the global economy, engineering, and education systems.
