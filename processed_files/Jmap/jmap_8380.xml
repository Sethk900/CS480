Changes in vegetation structure induced by domestic grazing in Patagonia (Southern Argentina)We analyzed the structural differences associated with grazing exclusion on vegetation by studying 24 grazedâ€“ungrazed paired sites in Patagonia (Argentina). Our objectives were to evaluate the effect of grazing on plant species composition, plant diversity, the relative abundance of plant functional types, and the vertical and horizontal structure of the plant community. This study across the shrub-grass steppes of Patagonia highlights some important characteristics of the vegetation response to a major disturbance factor we show that shrub encroachment is not a generalized response of the steppe to grazing. Grazed areas presented lower richness and diversity than exclosures. Physiognomic changes (as describe by relative abundance of plant functional types) were less important than those observed at the species level. These results shown that the status of the shrub-grass steppes of the Occidental district of Patagonia can not be characterized in terms of contrasting physiognomic states as in the case of the grass steppes of the Subandean district. Forbs and a few mesophytic and xerophytic grasses are the key elements to identify the condition of the steppe. Monitoring programs should focus on the relative abundance of these components.
