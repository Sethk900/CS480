Description and biological parameters of Ooencyrtus isabellae Guerrieri and Noyes sp. nov. (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea: Encyrtidae), a potential biocontrol agent of Zophiuma butawengi (Heller) (Hemiptera: Fulgoromorpha: Lophopidae) in Papua New GuineaThe planthopper Zophiuma butawengi (Heller) (= Z. lobulata Ghauri) is a serious pest of coconut and oil palm in Papua New Guinea, causing palm decay known as Finschhafen disorder. Recently, two dominant species of parasitoids emerged from egg masses of this pest, namely Parastethynium maxwelli (Girault) (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) and an undescribed species of Ooencyrtus Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae). The latter species, here described, appears to be a potential biocontrol agent of Z. butawengi especially in the New Britain Province of Papua New Guinea. Biological features of the new species, i.e. development time and adult longevity, were also calculated to give information that could help in its use in biological control programmes.
