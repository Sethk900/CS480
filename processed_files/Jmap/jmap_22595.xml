Two new species of Elatostema (Urticaceae) from southeast Yunnan, ChinaAbstract Elatostema pleiophlebium and Elatostema malipoense, two endemic species from southeast Yunnan of China, are described and illustrated. Their diagnostic characters, description and relationship with morphologically similar species are also given. Elatostema pleiophlebium is easily recognised by its glabrous stem and leaf blade, and its longitudinally 1-ribbed outer staminate bracts. Elatostema malipoense is morphologically distinct for its tuberculate achene and pistillate receptacle which is puberulous. Both new species are known only from their type localities, and they are proposed to be classified as critically endangered.
