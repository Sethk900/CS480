Metazoan endoparasites of 14 species of skinks (Squamata: Scincidae) from Papua New GuineaThree hundred and three individuals representing 14 species of lizards (Scincidae), collected in Papua New Guinea, were examined for metazoan endoparasites. Two species of Digenea, four species of Cestoda, 21 species of Nematoda (adults and larvae in cysts), two species of Acanthocephala and one species of Pentastomida were found. Forty-two new host records and two new locality records are reported. Skinks from Papua New Guinea are infected by â€œgeneralistâ€ endoparasites, which parasitize a variety of reptile or amphibian hosts. Mean endoparasite species diversity per skink species was 5.0 Â± 3.3 SD, range: 1â€“11.
