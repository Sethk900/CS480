Choreutidae of Madeira: review of the known species and description of the male of Anthophila threnodes (Walsingham, 1910) (Lepidoptera)Abstract. We review and illustrate the four species of Choreutidae recorded from Madeira – Anthophila threnodes (Walsingham), Anthophila fabriciana (Linnaeus), Choreutis nemorana (Hübner), and Tebenna micalis (Mann) – and describe and illustrate for the first time the male of Anthophila threnodes, as well as the biology of this Madeiran endemic. We provide brief notes on each of the species and give short diagnoses for correctly identifying them. Finally, we discuss previous misidentifications of Madeiran choreutids and the occurrence of choreutids on other oceanic islands.
