Molecular phylogeny of major lineages of the avian family Phasianidae inferred from complete mitochondrial genome sequencesPhasianidae is a large family of birds which contains most of the gallinaceous birds of the world. So far, the taxonomic status of many genera within Phasianidae has been controversial. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the white-eared pheasant (Crossoption crossoptilon) was determined in this study. Combining this with other previously published mitochondrial genome sequences, we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of Phasianidae and related species using maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) methods. All analyses yielded a similar and well-supported topology, in which Crossoptilon grouped with Lophura. Perdix dauurica was sister taxon to the gallopheasants with high support, and Pucrasia was sister to this clade and separate from the other tragopans. Tetraophasis and Lophophorus grouped together, with Tragopan as the sister taxon. In addition, our results indicated that Meleagris clustered with Bonasa forming a monophyletic clade embedded in the pheasantâ€partridge clade and the turkeyâ€“grouse lineage should be considered a part of the pheasantâ€“partridge radiation.
