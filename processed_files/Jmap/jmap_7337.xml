Distribution patterns of Paraguayan leafâ€cutting ants (Atta and Acromyrmex) (Formicidae: Attini)Abstract 432 transects were run in 19 sites in Paraguay, encompassing 8 major habitat types, to examine the distribution patterns of the taxa of leafâ€cutting ants. Colonies of Acromyrmex were significantly correlated with decreasing habitat complexity, while colonies of Atta showed a similar, though nonâ€significant, trend. A mean of 3.04 species of leafâ€cutters was found per site, with a maximum of 7 species recorded. By comparing colony incidences of one genera with the other, intraâ€generic competition is suggested. Discriminant analysis indicated that pasture species and colony densities were much more like those of cultivated land, and that disturbed habitats were much more variable in species composition and colony densities than undisturbed habitats. Canonical correlation analysis of standardized colony densities of 15 taxa of leafâ€cutters and 6 gross habitat variables permited the identification and quantification of their interrelations, and explained up to 73% of the variation in colony densities. A principal axis factor analysis corroborated these findings, and also gave estimates for the habitat niche breadths of the 15 taxa in terms of their unique variances.
