Water transmission of unsaturated soil samples in relation to mixed Na(Ca + Mg) solutionsThe effects of electrolyte concentration (i.e., EC: 20, 40, 80, 125 and 250 meq. l−1) and sodium adsorption ratios (i.e., SAR: 0, 20, 30, 40, 80 and Full-size image (<1 K)Full-size image (<1 K)) on water diffusivity (D (θ)) and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (κ (θ)) were evaluated for samples of sandy loam and clay loam. Both D(θ) and κ(θ) were found to be highly dependent on soil water content, EC and SAR of the infiltrating solution, and texture of sample. In general, the values of D(θ) and κ(θ) decreased with the decrease of water content and EC and increase of SAR and clay content of the sample. The magnitude of these parameters at various degrees of water saturation suggested that the adverse effects of high SAR's and low electrolyte concentrations on the percentage decrease of κ(θ) could be reduced by maintaining a low water content in the transmission zone during infiltration.
