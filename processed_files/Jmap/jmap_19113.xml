Soil respiration and its controlling factors in rice fields in the hill region of the central Sichuan BasinMeasurements of soil respiration, soil temperature and rice biomass were made during the rice growing season in the hill region of the central Sichuan Basin from April to September 2003. Characteristics of the daily and seasonal variations of soil respiration and their controlling factors are presented. The results showed that daily variations of soil respiration could be modeled with a single peak curve. The minimum and maximum soil respiration values from rice fields occurred at 7: 00 and 15: 00, respectively. Daily soil respiration rates were highly con-elated with 5 cm depth soil temperature measurements. The mean rate of soil respiration was 121.76 mg (.) m(-2) (.) h(-1), ranging from 18.00 to 269.69 mg (.) m(-2.)h(-1) during the growing season. Rice root biomass and 5 cm depth soil temperatures were the major factors influencing soil CO2 emissions during the entire growing season. There was a significant relationship between the rate of soil respiration and root biomass of rice during the initial growing season. From the middle/late stages to mature stage, 5 cm depth soil temperatures played a key role in regulating soil CO2 emissions from rice fields, while the relationship between the rate of soil respiration and water levels in the rice fields was not obvious.
