Multivariate assessment of environmental effects on hard red winter wheat. I. Principal-components analysis of yield and bread-making characteristicsThe attributes of yield and bread-making quality of winter wheats produced in the Free State are subject to environmental effects. The result is a supply to the baking industry of flour of inconsistent quality, which in turn is detrimental to the market value of wheat. Various genetic and environmental factors may affect bread-making quality. In the first part of this study we demonstrated the magnitude of environmental and genetic factors, and used principal-components analysis to examine the underlying source of variability in the bread-making quality of winter wheat cultivars. Yield and protein concentration responded to environmental influences, whereas the dough-mixing requirement was primarily inherently determined. Variation in protein concentration accounted for variation in the mixing requirement of one cultivar and the SDS sedimentation volume of most cultivars.
