Quantification of Hydrocarbon Contaminants in Meltwater and Sediment in a City Snow PileAbstractSnow collected from roadways in northern climates is not pristine and may contain sand or gravel, deicing agents, litter, and airborne pollutants. Although fate and transport of contaminants in snowmelt has been studied under laboratory conditions, it is unknown whether the same mechanisms apply to a heterogeneous snow pile. This case study sought to identify and quantify organic species in snow pile meltwater in Edmonton, Canada, and estimate the total potential hydrocarbon loading bound to sediment. Analysis of meltwater and sediment samples revealed that most hydrocarbons were present in sediments, with meltwater containing low concentrations (<1  mg L−1) of F2 (>C10–C16) and F3 (>C16–C34) fraction hydrocarbons. Sediments showed detectable levels of F2 and F3 hydrocarbons in ∼21% of the samples tested, with concentrations ranging from approximately 600 to 7,800  mg·kg−1, with average F3 concentrations (the main source of hydrocarbons) well below Canadian guidelines for most samples. The estimated total hydrocarbon loading of the snow pile studied was ∼5.1  t of hydrocarbons. Findings are anticipated to be of value in the establishment of water quality monitoring programs, environmental policy and strategies involving the treatment, disposal, or reuse of residual snow pile sediments.
