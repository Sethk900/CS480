On Neonemura illiesi nov. spec. and some other Stoneflies from Chile (Ins., Plecoptera)Recently, two small collections of stoneflies came to my disposal. One of them consisted of a number of small paperbags containing dried Plecoptera which had been collected by W. Kuschel from 1954 to 1958 at Frutillar, province Llanquihue and on Isla Chiloé. They had been given to Prof. lilies but remained unstudied and were not considered in his studies of South-American Plecoptera. Dr. F. Reiss (Plön) kindly sent me some Plecoptera (in alcohol) which he had collected in Chile in 1969. Each of these collections contained an unknown representative of Plecoptera.
