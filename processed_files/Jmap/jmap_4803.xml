The taxonomic utility of the male upper lip morphology in the ostracod genus Parapolycope (Crustacea), with descriptions of two new speciesThe male copulatory organ is recognized as a significant character for species taxonomy in the sexually reproducing Ostracoda. However, the genus Parapolycope has a simply shaped male copulatory organ consisting almost entirely of just the copulatory duct. In this study, two new species, Parapolycope psittacina sp. nov. and Parapolycope uncata sp. nov., are described, and the characters that have taxonomic value were examined based on a morphological comparison of these new species. Carapace size, shape and surface ornamentation, and the male upper lip are valuable characteristics for species identification. The morphology of the male upper lip, especially, exhibited a remarkable sexual dimorphism, which might have a function associated with reproductive isolation. http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:D2F2F902-C496-4861-8872-813BC310AD9F
