A new species of the genus Coraciacarus (Gabuciniidae, Pterolichoidea) from the huia Heteralocha acutirostris (Callaeatidae, Passeriformes), an extinct bird species from New ZealandWe describe one new feather mite species Coraciacarus muellermotzfeldi sp. nov. (Acari, Astigmata) found as dried corpses on the feathers of the museum skin of the huia Heteralocha acutirostris (Gould, 1837) (Passeriformes, Callaeatidae). This endemic New Zealand passerine bird is believed to have been extinct since the beginning of the twentieth century. Comments on the systematic position of the new species within the genus Coraciacarus are presented. A key to all known species and subspecies of the genus is provided. The unusually wide host range of Coraciacarus is discussed. The presence of a representative of this genus on a passerine bird is an enigmatic phenomenon. It might be the result of horizontal transfer from cuckoos (Cuculiformes) rather than ancient coâ€phylogenesis but this hypothesis is only weakly supported by currently available data.
