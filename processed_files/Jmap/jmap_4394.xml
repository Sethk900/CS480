Underutilised indigenous and traditional crops: why is research on water use important for South Africa?The answer to the question ‘why is research on water use important for South Africa?’ is quite straightforward: more research is needed because there is a major gap in knowledge on water use of indigenous crops. These indigenous edible plants have sustained rural populations in developing countries for many decades if not centuries. Traditional crops are native to specific localities, are therefore better adapted to the environmental conditions and can be cultivated without the need for expensive inputs such as irrigation water and agri-chemicals (Water Research Commission, 2008). This must be seen in the context of the fact that the biggest share of water is used for farming, while at least 15 million people in rural areas of South Africa live below the poverty line. In the Research and Development Strategy for Water Utilisation in Agriculture (Water Research Commission, 2008) it is therefore stated that two relevant objectives are to (1) increase biological, technical and economic efficiency of water use; and (2) reduce poverty through water-based agricultural activities. Although farming makes a relative small contribution (7 – 12%) to income for livelihoods of the rural poor population (Van Aver-beke, 2008), there are many unutilised opportunities for production and earning of income, particularly from indigenous crops. Agriculture (farming and agri-processing activities) is therefore the key to rural development, but this requires that water use and production must be analysed as a value adding process in the food value chain (Backeberg & Sanewe, 2006).
