Sage grouse coccidiosis not transmissible to chickens[long dash]Cross-infection expts. are cited which show that coccidiosis (Eimeria angusta and for E. centro-cerci) is not carried to domestic chickens by the sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), and it seems probable that infection by the sage grouse is not brought about by contact with infected domestic birds.
