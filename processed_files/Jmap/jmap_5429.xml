Major histocompatibility complex Class II DRB exonâ€2 diversity of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in ChinaThe major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is an important component of the vertebrate immune system where it determines which antigens trigger an immune response. In this study the MHC class II DRB genes were investigated in the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) by using a cloningâ€“sequencing method. Analysis in 16 individuals from typical distribution areas in China indicated a relatively high level of allelic diversity: 13 alleles with high sequence polymorphism at 46 variable sites (19.33% of the 238 nucleotides). An overall purifying selection was detected, with one strongly positively selected site located within antigenâ€binding sites. The main driving force that led to this allelic diversity pattern is discussed.
