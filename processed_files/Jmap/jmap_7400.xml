A curious new genus and species of Atalophlebiinae (Ephemeroptera: Leptophlebiidae) from the Southern Coastal Mountains of BrazilAbstract A new genus and species of Atalophlebiinae, Perissophlebia flinti, is described based on nymphal specimens collected from the Serra dos √ìrg√£os of southern Brazil. Nymphs of P. flinti display a large number of derived character states that appear to be correlated with a sprawling habit and the use of the legs for collecting‚Ägathering.
