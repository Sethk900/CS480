A new species of spider fly in the genus Sabroskya Schlinger from Malawi, with a key to Acrocerinae world genera (Diptera, Acroceridae)Abstract In this paper we diagnose the genus Sabroskya Schlinger, 1960 and describe Sabroskya schlingeri sp. n. from Malawi. We also provide dichotomous keys to species of Sabroskya and to world genera of the subfamily Acrocerinae, both extant and extinct.
