Changes in CO2 emissions after crop conversion from continuous maize to alfalfaMitigation strategies for the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions are the central focus of the Kyoto Protocol and international scientific efforts. Agriculture plays a substantial role in the balance of the most significant greenhouse gases (CO2, N2O, CH4), mostly attributed to management practices. In this study, we present data on the effects of a conversion from a cropland (Zea mays L.) to N-2-fixing grassland (Medicago sativa L.) on C cycle in an agricultural area of Northern Italy. Net ecosystem production (NEP) and net biome production (NBP) have been followed for 2 years by measuring CO2 fluxes by paired eddy covariance stations (EC) and Continuous soil respiration measurements (SR). Root exclusion Subplot replicates were also used to estimate heterotrophic respiration (Rh). The comparison between the net primary production (NPP) inventory estimation and NPP based oil measured CO2 fluxes (EC and Rh) showed excellent agreement for both land uses. An increase ill NEP was observed 2 years after conversion from corn to alfalfa (+281 g C m(-2)), however, ill terms of NBP, maize was a lower source of C (-96 g C m(-2)) than alfalfa (-354 g C m(-2)). From the present Study, it appears that this type of land conversion is not all effective measure of C sequestration ill the short term (1-3 years). (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
