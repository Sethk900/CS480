Nest architecture and colony composition of communally nesting Spilomena socialis sp. n. (Hymenoptera, Crabronidae, Pemphredoninae) from peninsular MalaysiaCommunal nesting, rare in the crabronid wasps, has been recorded for various species in the Spilomenina clade of the Pemphredoninae. A new communally nesting species, Spilomena socialis, is described from peninsular Malaysia where it nested on buildings at Bukit Fraser. The nest consists of a group of closely spaced clusters of vertically oriented cells attached to walls, and is constructed of tiny pieces of vegetal and mineral origin, parts of insects, and fungal hyphae bound together by silk secreted from each female waspâ€™s abdominal gland. Nests contained up to 39 cells (average 10.4 cells, N = 35). Nest entrances were at the upper end of the cells and were protected on one side by a â€œroofâ€. Cells constructed side-by-side have their roofs connected to form a tube that allowed access to all the cells. Nests were inhabited by 1â€“13 females (average 4.3 females per nest, N = 21) and 0â€“4 males, the overall sex ratio being 0.22. Ovarian development among the females in a nest varied. In 8 of 20 nests with 3 or more females only one female had developed ovaries, but female size (measured as head width) did not correlate with ovarian development. Cells are apparently progressively provisioned with thrips, and are often re-used. Adult females cooperatively defend the nests against intruders.
