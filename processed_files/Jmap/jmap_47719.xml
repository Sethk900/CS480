Spatial niche variation in two sympatric species of Bokermannohyla (Anura: Hylidae) in southeastern BrazilWe studied patterns of microhabitat use by adults of two sympatric Bokermannohyla species at the Reserva Particular do Patrimônio Natural Santuário do Caraça, southeastern Brazil. We selected three streams, one where both species occurred in syntopy and the other two where each one occurred alone. We sampled 150-m transects in each stream throughout 1 year, recording microhabitat features for each frog located (substrate type, height and distance from water). Microhabitat availability varied between dry and wet seasons in all streams, and overall microhabitat diversity changed in two streams. Bokermannohyla nanuzae seemed to have a niche contraction in the presence of Bokermannohyla martinsi, but this only happened during the dry season. Microhabitat requirements during the wet season may be closely linked to similar reproductive needs that probably represent a strong selective pressure, forcing niche overlap.
