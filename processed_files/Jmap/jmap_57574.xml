Winter Effluent Quality from Partial-Infiltration Permeable Pavement SystemsAbstractThis study, conducted between 2010 and 2012, compares the winter quality of storm water outflows from one pervious concrete and two permeable interlocking concrete pavement systems with runoff from an asphalt control pavement. The permeable pavement systems were designed for partial infiltration with underdrains. During the winter, the pavements were plowed and, occasionally, salted. Analyses are based on samples of permeable pavement effluent and asphalt runoff collected for 19 events over two winter seasons. The permeable pavement systems performed similarly and provided excellent storm water treatment during winter months by reducing event mean concentrations (EMC) and total pollutant loadings for petroleum hydrocarbons, total suspended solids, metals (copper, iron, manganese, and zinc), and nutrients (total-nitrogen and total-phosphorus). The permeable pavements were also shown to provide temporary storage and create opportunities for the dilution of sodium and chloride in outflows. Road salt was identified as a pollutant source for numerous pollutants beyond sodium and chloride. Freezing conditions did not inhibit the functionality of the permeable pavement systems for storm water treatment.
