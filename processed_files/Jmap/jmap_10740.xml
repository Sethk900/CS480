Summary remarks and personal observations of the situation by an old hunter and researcherThe precipitous drop in numbers of prairie grouse (Tympanuchus spp.) in North America prompted convening a workshop to address the issue during the 9th Annual Meeting of The Wildlife Society. Speakers provided a historical perspective of the loss of the North American prairie ecosystem and concurrent declines of prairie grouse. Problems associated with managing isolated grouse populations were reviewed and a set of guidelines for the management of lesser prairie-chickens (T. pallidicintus) was presented. The need for a valid survey technique was highlighted, as was the lack of information on the impacts of parasites and diseases on prairie grouse populations. The take-away message: unless an aggressive plan to reverse the downward trend of prairie grouse populations is implemented in the very near future, the lesser prairie-chicken and possibly the greater prairie-chicken (T. cupido pinnatus) will follow the path of the Attwater's prairie-chicken (T.c. attwateri).
