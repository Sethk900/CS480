Summer drought reduces total and litter-derived soil CO2 effluxes in temperate grassland - clues from a C-13 litter addition experimentCurrent climate change models predict significant changes in rainfall patterns across Europe. To explore the effect of drought on soil CO2 efflux (F-Soil) and on the contribution of litter to F-Soil we used rain shelters to simulate a summer drought (May to July 2007) in an intensively managed grassland in Switzerland by reducing annual precipitation by around 30% similar to the hot and dry year 2003 in Central Europe. We added C-13-depleted as well as unlabelled grass/clover litter to quantify the litter-derived CO2 efflux (F-Litter). Soil CO2 efflux and the C-13/C-12 isotope ratio (delta C-13) of the respired CO2 after litter addition were measured during the growing season 2007. Drought significantly decreased F-Soil in our litter addition experiment by 59% and F-Litter by 81% during the drought period itself (May to July), indicating that drought had a stronger effect on the CO2 release from litter than on the belowground-derived CO2 efflux (F-BG, i.e. soil organic matter (SOM) and root respiration). Despite large bursts in respired CO2 induced by the rewetting after prolonged drought, drought also reduced F-Soil and F-Litter during the entire C-13 measurement period (April to October) by 26% and 37%, respectively. Overall, our findings show that drought decreased F-Soil and altered its seasonality and its sources. Thus, the C balance of temperate grassland soils respond sensitively to changes in precipitation, a factor that needs to be considered in regional models predicting the impact of climate change on ecosystems C balance.
