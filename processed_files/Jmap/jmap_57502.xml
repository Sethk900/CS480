Effects of Added Fe°, Fe3O4, and Fe2O3 on Sorption of Cephalosporin Antibiotic in Quartz-Rich SandsAbstractBatch experiments were performed to evaluate sorption of zwitterionic and anionic cephapirin (CHP° and CHP–, respectively), a cephalosporin antibiotic, in two quartz-rich sands spiked with iron (0.5–5% by weight). Sand A was approximately 65% quartz and 29% feldspar, with a grain diameter of 0.11 mm. Sand B was approximately 97% quartz and approximately 2% feldspar with a grain diameter of 0.39 mm. Bulk CHP sorption was evaluated relative to four added iron phases, namely, Fe° [zero-valent iron (ZVI)], Fe3O4 (magnetite), and two forms of Fe2O3 (dull and specular hematite). Iron-particle sizes matched the respective sands to which they were added. Experiments were performed at two temperatures (21 and 39°C) and the results were compared with CHP sorption in unspiked sands. Maximum sorption occurred in Sand B and was approximately 225  mg/kg of spiked sand for initial aqueous CHP concentrations of 5–50 ppm, at 39°C and pH 5. Addition of ZVI caused the largest increase in CHP sorption with distribution coefficients (Kd′s) nearly 12 times those of ZVI-free sands. The study results imply the potential use of microscale ZVI, and to a lesser extent iron oxides, in the remediation of cephalosporin-contaminated groundwater and soil.
