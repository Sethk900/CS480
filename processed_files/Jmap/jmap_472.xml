Short-Term and Long-Term Effects of Soil Ripping, Seeding, and Fertilization on the Restoration of a Tropical Rangeland.Rangeland degradation is a serious problem in semiarid Africa. Extensive areas of bare, compacted, nutrient-poor soils limit the productivity and biodiversity of many areas. We conducted a set of restoration experiments in which all eight combinations of soil tilling, fertilization, and seeding with native perennial grasses were carried out in replicated plots. After 6 months, little aboveground biomass was produced in plots without tilling, regardless of seeding or fertilization. Tilling alone tripled plant biomass, mostly of herbaceous forbs and annual grasses. Perennial grasses were essentially limited to plots that were both tilled and seeded. The addition of fertilizer had no significant additional effects. After 7 years, vegetation had declined, but there were still large differences among treatments. After 10 years, one tilled (and seeded) plot had reverted to bare ground, but the other tilled plots still had substantial vegetation. Only one seeded grass (<em>Cenchrus ciliaris</em>) was still a contributor to total cover after 10 years. We suggest that restoration efforts on these soils be directed first to breaking up the surface crust, and second to the addition of desirable seed. A simple ripping trial inspired by this experiment showed considerable promise as a low-cost restoration technique.
