Sensitivity to climate change for two reptiles at the Mojaveâ€“Sonoran Desert interfaceThe high temperatures and extended droughts that characterize habitat for desert-living reptiles may already approach their physiological tolerances and so could put them at risk due to climate change. Here I examined climate change sensitivity for desert tortoises, Gopherus agassizii, and common chuckwallas, Sauromalus ater, two large-bodied reptiles that occur across the MojaveeSonoran Desert interface. I employed the Mahalanobis D2 statistic to model their niche spaces and then assessed climate-change sensitivity by altering climate variables along a gradient of increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation. While shifting climate variables, I held terrain and soils variables that otherwise deï¬ne these speciesâ€™ preferred habitat constant, providing a more realistic prediction of available niche space. Both reptilesâ€™ modeled niches responded to climate change by shifting to higher elevations and increasingly away from their Sonoran Desert distribution. At moderate predictions of climate change (Ã¾2 C, 50 mm precipitation) desert tortoisesâ€™ suitable habitat was reduced by nearly 88% in the Sonoran Desert portions my study area, and nearly 66% in the Mojave Desert regions. Under the same scenario chuckwallas lost nearly 92%, but increased 120% respectively. Within the context of climate change potential increases in drought frequency appear to present the greater challenge for these species.
