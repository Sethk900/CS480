Atmospheric conditions for monitoring the long-term vegetation dynamics in the Amazon using normalized difference vegetation indexThis study examined the effect of biomass-burning aerosols and clouds on the temporal dynamics of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) exhibited by two widely used, time-series NDVI data products: the Pathfinder AVHRR land (PAL) dataset and the NASA Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling Studies (GIMMS) dataset. The PAL data are 10-day maximum-value NDVI composites from 1982 to 1999 with corrections for Rayleigh scattering and ozone absorption. The GIMMS data are 15-day maximum-value NDVI composites from 1982 to 1999. In our analysis, monthly maximum-value NDVI was extracted from these datasets. The effects were quantified by comparing time-series of NDVI from PAL and GIMMS with observations from the SPOT/VEGETATION sensor and aerosol index data from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS), and results from radiative transfer simulation. Our analysis suggests that the substantial large-scale NDVI seasonality observed in the south and east Amazon forest region with PAL and GIMMS is primarily caused by variations in atmospheric conditions associated with biomass-burning aerosols and cloudiness. Reliable NDVI data can be typically acquired from April to July when such effects are relatively low, whereas there is a few effective NDVI data from September to December. In the central Amazon forest region, where aerosol loads are relatively low throughout the year, large-scale NDVI seasonality results primarily from seasonal variations in cloud cover. Careful treatment of these aerosol and cloud effects is required when using NDVI from PAL and GIMMS (or other source) to determine large-scale seasonal and interannual dynamics of vegetation greenness and ecosystemâatmosphere CO2 exchange in the Amazon region.
