Corrected and supplemented descriptions of certain characoid fishes described by Henry W. Fowler, with revisions of several of their generaAbstract Corrected descriptions plus added information are given for 33 species of characoid fishes (Cypriniformes) described by Henry W. Fowler, based largely on a reexamination of their holotypes. Some synonymies are proposed and certain taxa, at the tribe or genus level, are discussed. The latter include a numerical treatment of the genera or the Aphyoditeini, and keys to Hasemania, Phenocogaster, Microschemobrycon and Cynopotamus
