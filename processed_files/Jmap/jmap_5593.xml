The genera Parotoplana Meixner, 1938 and Parotoplanella Ax, 1956 (Platyhelminthes: Proseriata) in southern SpainCollecting in southern Spain yielded five species of Parotoplana and one species of Parotoplanella (Proseriata: Otoplanidae). Four species of Paratoplana proved to be new to science. Parotoplana cucullata sp. n. is distinguished by the shape of the lateral spines in the copulatory organ and in the presence of a â€œglandular organâ€ around the distal portion of the female duct. Parotoplana fretigaditani sp. n. is similar to P. procerostyla Ax, 1956 in the general arrangement of spines, but their fine morphology is distinctive. Parotoplana varispinosa sp. n. differs from P. capitata Ax, 1956 in the shape and number of spines. Parotoplana mastigophora sp. n. has a unique morphology of the stylet, and the spines of the girdle markedly differ in size and shape. The karyotype of P. cucullata sp. n. (nÂ =Â 6) is described. In addition, Parotoplana primitiva and Parotoplanella heterorhabditica, previously known from the Atlantic coast of France and northâ€west Mediterranean, respectively, were found. The high proportion of new species demonstrates the present poor state of knowledge of interstial meiofauna.
