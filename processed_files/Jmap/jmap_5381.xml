The freshwater shrimps of the genera Caridina and Parisia from karst caves of Sulawesi Selatan, Indonesia, with descriptions of three new species (Crustacea: Decapoda: Caridea: Atyidae)The present study reports on collections of hypogean freshwater atyid shrimps of the genera Caridina Milne Edwards, 1837, and Parisia Holthuis, 1956, obtained from the karst caves and associated epigean waters of Sulawesi, Indonesia. Six species of Caridina were present, of which two are new to science and one is new to Sulawesi, as well as one new species of Parisia. Types of Caridina pareparensis De Man, 1892, and C. pareparensis parvidentata Roux, 1904, were reâ€examined and redescribed; lectotypes for both taxa are designated. Caridina pareparensis parvidentata is here regarded as a distinct species. The new taxa are described, figured and compared with congeners. â€ Present address: National Biodiversity Centre, National Parks Board, 1 Cluny Road, Singapore 259569, Republic of Singapore.
