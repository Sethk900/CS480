Cylindrocladiella hahajimaensis, a new species of Cylindrocladiella transferred from VerticilliumAbstract We used phylogenetic analyses based on ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and beta-tubulin (TUB) sequences and determined that the correct name of ‘Verticillium hahajimaense’ was Cylindrocladiella hahajimaensis. A closest relative could not be determined, since Cylindrocladiella hahajimaensis clustered within the Cylindrocladiella infestans species complex, a poorly resolved group of taxa. Cylindrocladiella hahajimaensis differed from all other members of the Cylindrocladiella infestans species complex by at least 18 substitutions at the two loci. Morphological characters supported the placement within Cylindrocladiella. In addition to the verticillate conidiophores mentioned in the type description, we found evidence for the presence of penicillate conidiophores. Other differences to the type description included the presence of yellow to brown-pigmented hyphae, and the hyaline instead of pigmented chlamydospores.
