The possible use of agar gel in plant nutritional studiesNutrition-element elimination studies on crops in soil with a high fixation capacity using pot experiments are usually problematic where the realistic and accurate application of nutrients is concerned. The possible use of agar gel in plant nutritional studies was investigated. Commercial agar-agar, used for microbiological purposes, was found to have low enough nutrient concentrations to be used. Furthermore, 1.5% agar blocks were found to be stable in soil during glasshouse pot trials and can be effectively used as a nutrient carrier as they will temporarily protect nutrients against sorption and precipitation due to phase difference.
