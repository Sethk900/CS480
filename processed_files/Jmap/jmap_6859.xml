Population Structure and Reproductive Aspects of the Freshwater Turtle, Phrynops geoffroanus, Inhabiting an Urban River in Southeastern BrazilThe population structure and reproductive aspects of P. geoffroanus (Chelidae) in an urban river at Ribeirão Preto city, São Paulo state, southeastern Brazil, was studied by monthly captures and census from May 1997 to October 1998. A total of 247 turtles was sampled, 53 of them juveniles. Sex ratio was variable but never significantly different from 1 : 1. Captured turtles varied throughout the months but census indicated higher activity of turtles in spring, positively correlated to high air temperatures and negatively with rainfall. X-ray analysis of females revealed clutch sizes ranging between 8–20 and suggested that nesting occurred from February to August. Egg and clutch sizes were strongly correlated to female body size.
