Modeling Effects of Sediment Diagenesis on Recovery of Hypolimnetic OxygenAbstractDiagenesis of particulate organic matter in sediments can have important effects on the dissolved oxygen (DO) resources of lakes and delay potential benefits from reductions in phosphorus (P) loading. A sediment diagenesis model of intermediate complexity, Sed2Ks, is developed and tested for Onondaga Lake, New York, and linked to a validated one-dimensional mechanistic hydrodynamic/stratification model (UFILS4). Modeling was supported by detailed characterization of the pelagic sediments and long-term monitoring of the lake’s water column that included transformation from hypereutrophy to upper mesotrophy and coupled improvements in hypolimnetic DO. Sed2Ks performed well in representing the observed decreasing trajectory of the downward flux of particulate organic carbon and in predicting the decreases in sediment effluxes of dissolved inorganic carbon and sediment oxygen demand over a 30-year period. Sed2Ks and the linked overall water-quality model, UFILS4/Sed2Ks, were applied to project the extent and timing of improvements in sediment fluxes and hypolimnetic DO resources for an array of P management alternatives. Substantial delays in response associated with the effects of diagenesis were predicted that extended ≥40  years to reach 95% of steady state. Long-term projections indicate that improvements from the most aggressive P control alternatives may be sufficient to maintain certain coldwater fish.
