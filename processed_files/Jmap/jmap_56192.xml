Copper accumulation and fractionation in vineyard soils from temperate humid zone (NW Iberian Peninsula)The occurrence of total Cu and Cu fractions (exchangeable Cu, Cu bound to organic matter, Cu bound to amorphous inorganic materials, Cu bound to crystalline Fe and Al oxides and residual Cu) was studied in 170 surface layers of soils from seven vineyard regions located in the NW Iberian Peninsula (Rías Baixas, Ribeira Sacra, Ribeiro, Monterrei, Valdeorras, O Bierzo and Vinhos Verdes). The data showed that long-term application of Cu-based fungicides has led to increased concentrations, mainly in superficial vineyard soil layers. Thus, 64% of the samples showed total Cu levels higher than 100 mg kg− 1, threshold for soil contamination. Total Cu content in Ribeiro (248 ± 130 mg kg− 1) and Ribeira Sacra (259 ± 118 mg kg− 1) soils were significantly higher than those observed for the rest of the vineyard regions (169 ± 90, 139 ± 122, 115 ± 42, 103 ± 42 and 100 ± 48 mg kg− 1 in Valdeorras, Rías Baixas, O Bierzo, Vinhos Verdes and Monterrei, respectively). Cu distribution among various soil fractions also differed between winegrowing regions; however, in general, Cu in these vineyard soils is present mainly in less mobile fractions (average values were 48 ± 12% for Cu bound to soil organic matter; 15 ± 9% for Cu associated to amorphous inorganic materials; 12 ± 9% for Cu bound to crystalline Fe and Al oxides and 23 ± 12% for residual Cu), whereas exchangeable Cu constituted approximately 3 ± 3% of total Cu. All soil samples were separated in three well differentiated groups according to their physical, chemical and Cu fractionation data (Ribeiro, Ribeira Sacra and Monterrei samples; O Bierzo, Valdeorras and Monterrei samples; Rías Baixas and Vinhos Verdes samples), being soil type, climate and fungicide application as the most determinant factors for soil quality.
