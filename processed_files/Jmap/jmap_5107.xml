An overview of female reproductive traits in South American Mabuya (Squamata, Scincidae), with emphasis on brood size and its correlatesThe viviparous New World Mabuya (Reptilia, Scincidae) are characterized by a peculiar suite of reproductive traits associated with an extreme degree of matrotrophy and a specialized placenta. We gathered information on female reproductive traits of South American Mabuya based on a compilation of literature data plus original information on two species (Mabuya dorsivittata and Mabuya macrorhyncha). Considering brood size, we identified one â€œlarge-broodedâ€ group (brood sizes up to eight to ten) and one â€œsmall-broodedâ€ group (brood sizes up to four to six). Brood size tended to be positively correlated with female body size among species, although the correlation is not as strong as it is within species. There were some general trends for the reproductive ecology of New World Mabuya, such as early sexual maturation, brood sizes of usually four to six young, and parturition occurring around the dryâ€“wet season transition.
