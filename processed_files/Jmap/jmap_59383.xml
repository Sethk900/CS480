The new species differs from all other Linopherus species by the shape of prostomium and caruncle. The posterior margin of prostomium is bilobed; the caruncle arises medially and confluently from the posterior margin of the prostomium, joining together with prostomium. A key to distinguish the known species of the genus is provided.
