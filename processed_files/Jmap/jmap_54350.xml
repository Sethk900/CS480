Landform classification and soil distribution in hummocky terrain, Saskatchewan, CanadaThis study presents a classification of distinct, three-dimensional landform elements and examines the relationship between these landform elements and selected soil morphological properties of Udic Boroll soils in southern Saskatchewan, Canada. The classification is based on defined ranges of three criteria derived from topographic data: gradient, profile (downslope) curvature, and plan (across-slope) curvature. Seven landform elements are recognized: convergent shoulders, divergent shoulders, convergent backslopes, divergent backslopes, convergent footslopes, divergent footslopes, and level elements. All of the elements are easily identified in the field. The thicknesses of A horizons and depths to calcium carbonate of the soils were consistently greater in convergent versus divergent elements in the same profile group (e.g. shoulders), and showed an overall increase in the sequence shoulders<backslopes<level<footslope elements. Distinct groups of elements emerge from a statistical analysis of the differences between individual and bivariate means of soil morphological properties associated with each landform element. The differences in soil properties among the elements can be largely explained by differences in water movement and distribution in hillslope systems. The results of the study highlight the need to consider land-surface morphology during the development of research designs for soil related studies.
