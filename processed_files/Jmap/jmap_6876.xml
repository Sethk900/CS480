First record of symphoresy between nymphs of the stonefly Kempnyia tijucana, and chironomid larvae, Nanocladius (Plecopteracoluthus) sp., in the NeotropicsThe symphoretic relationship between a species of Nanocladius (Plecopteracoluthus) (Diptera, Chironomidae) and Kempnyia tijucana (Plecoptera, Perlidae) is recorded and described for the first time from southeastern Brazil. About 31% of the collected perlids were hosts of the chironomid larvae. The entire larval cycle of N. (Plecopteracoluthus) sp. may be completed on a single instar of K. tijucana and the larval position on the host varied according to the stage of development of the chironomid, apparently being constant for young and old instars.
