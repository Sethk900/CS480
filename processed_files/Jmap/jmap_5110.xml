Two new species of the genus Lepidodasys (Gastrotricha, Lepidodasyidae) from Tsushima Island, JapanThis paper provides the first published record of Lepidodasys, a marine gastrotrich genus, from the Pacific. Two new species of Lepidodasys are described from the sublittoral sandy bottom off Tsushima Island, Japan, with morphological comparisons under scanning electronic microscopy. Lepidodasys laeviacus sp. nov. is allied to L. martini Remane in sharing the herring-bone pattern of the oval scales, but it is distinguished from the latter by the smooth scales lacking keel and the irregular array of 7–10 dorsal adhesive tubes in the trunk region. Lepidodasys tsushimaensis sp. nov. has cuticular armature with parallel orientation of smooth suboval scales, and is further characterized by 6–9 dorsal adhesive tubes along the median line in the intestinal region and ventrolateral adhesive tubes restricted in the pharyngeal region. A key to species of the genus Lepidodasys is provided.
