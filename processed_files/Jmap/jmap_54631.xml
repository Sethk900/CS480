Directional saturated hydraulic conductivity and macropore morphology of a soil-saprolite sequenceThe soils in the Piedmont and Mountain regions of the southeastern United States are characterized by the presence of saprolite at or near the soil surface. This study was conducted to describe the macropore network of a representative soil-saprolite sequence and to relate the directional saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile to water flow through macropores. Large observation pits were constructed at three geomorphic positions (ridge top, shoulder and ridge nose). Soil-saprolite macropores and their morphology were described in the field. Triplicate intact soil cores were collected in five orientations: one vertical, two horizontals (perpendicular to one another) and two diagonals (perpendicular to one another) from the Bt, B/C and C (massive saprolite) horizons at each of the geomorphic positions. The saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ka) of each intact core sample was determined in the laboratory. In situ Ka of each horizon was also determined near the three observation pits. Mean Ka values for the five orientations, three horizons and three geomorphic positions ranged from 8.20×10−8 m s−1 to 2.75×10−6 m s−1. Mean in situ Ka values ranged from 7.50×10−8 m s−1 to 2.66×10−6 m s−1. The results indicated that no significant differences existed among the Ka values in different orientations for each horizon-landscape combination, with no exceptionally high conductivity value. The in situ Ka results generally agree with the results for the core samples.
