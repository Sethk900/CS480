Taxonomic notes on Cryptamorpha sculptifrons Reitter (Coleoptera, Silvanidae), with description of its larval morphologyAbstract Cryptamorpha sculptifrons Reitter, 1889 is redescribed and a lectotype and paralectotype are designated. The mature larva of C. sculptifrons is described. It is hypothesized that a variety described by Grouvelle (1908), C. sculptifrons var. punctifrons from India, might not be conspecific with Japanese C. sculptifrons. It is also suggested that larvae of Cryptamorpha can be distinguished from larvae of the tribe Brontini by the relatively thick antennae and the 3rd antennomere which is less than 3/4 of the length of the 2nd.
