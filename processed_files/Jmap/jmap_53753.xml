Vascular plants at extreme elevations in eastern Ladakh, northwest HimalayasDue to the dry continental climate, the mountains of eastern Ladakh are unglaciated up to 6200â€“6400 m, with relatively large areas of developed soils between 5600 and 6000 m covered by sparse subnival vegetation. However, there are no studies on the composition of plant assemblages from such extreme elevations, their microclimates, vertical distributions and adaptive strategies.
