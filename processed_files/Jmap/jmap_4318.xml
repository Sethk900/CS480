A New Tribal Placement for Glyptolenus mirabilis (Straneo) (Coleoptera: Carabidae), comb. n., and Description of G. straneoi, sp. n. from EcuadorThe Neotropical species, Sculpturia mirabilis Straneo, originally described as a member of the tribe Pterostichini, is recognized and recombined as a member of the genus Glyptolenus Bates (tribe Platynini) based on characters of the protibia, defensive pygidial glands, internal female reproductive tract, and male genitalia. This action makes Sculpturia Straneo 1991 a junior synonym of Glyptolenus. A closely related species, Glyptolenus straneoi, sp. n. is described from the Rio Napo, Ecuador. Both species belong to Whitehead's Glyptolenus nigritus complex of South America. Modifications to Whitehead's (1974) key are provided to permit identification of both newly recognized species of Glyptolenus.
