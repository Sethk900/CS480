Incorporation of Variable-Speed Pumping in Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm Optimization of the Design of Water Transmission SystemsAbstractGlobal warming caused by human activities presents serious global risks. Individuals, governments, and industries need to be more energy efficient and contribute to the mitigation of global warming by reducing their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In previous research, GHG emission reduction has been identified as one important criterion in improving the sustainability of urban infrastructure and urban water systems. Within the water industry, opportunities exist for reducing GHG emissions by improving pumping efficiency via the use of variable-speed pumps (VSPs). Previously, VSPs have been used in the optimization of the operation of existing water distribution systems (WDSs). However, in WDS design optimization problems, fixed-speed pumps (FSPs) are commonly used. In this study, a pump power estimation method, developed using a false position method based optimization approach, is proposed to incorporate VSPs in the conceptual design or planning of water transmission systems (WTSs), using optimization. This pump power estimation method is implemented within the solution evaluation process via a multiobjective genetic algorithm approach. A case study is used to demonstrate the application of the pump power estimation method in estimating pump power and associated energy consumption of VSPs and FSPs in WTS optimization. In addition, comparisons are made between variable-speed pumping and fixed-speed pumping in multiobjective WTS optimization accounting for total cost and GHG emissions. The results show that the use of variable-speed pumping leads to significant savings in both total cost and GHG emissions from WTSs for the case study considered.
