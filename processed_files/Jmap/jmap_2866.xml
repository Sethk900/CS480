Breaking seed dormancy in Opuntia rastrera from the Chihuahuan desertIn this paper, we investigated if germination of after-ripened seeds of Opuntia rastrera Weber could be enhanced using chemical (acid) and mechanical scarification pretreatments. O. rastrera seeds need an after-ripening period to germinate (&AP; 50%) after 1 year and no germination occurs in younger seeds. Germination of 3-year old seeds of O. rastrera was evaluated using sulphuric acid (H2SO4) for different lengths of time, and mechanical scarification treatments (dry heating at 80&DEG; C for 12h and washing, immersion in water for 12h and washing, and seed coat cutting with pliers). Similar to other wild Opuntia species, germination of O. rastrera seeds was not enhanced by any scarification pretreatment, demonstrating that an after-ripening period is the best-if not the unique-way to overcome physiological dormancy for this species. &COPY; 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
