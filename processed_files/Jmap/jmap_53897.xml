Calcium-sodium exchange in some calcareous soils and a montmorillonite clay as compared with predictions based on double layer theoryA comparative study between Gapon's equation and the standard diffuse double-layer theory using activities of the ions in the equilibrium solution indicate that calcium-sodium exchange equilibria in calcareous soils cannot be exclusively attributed to valence and concentration effects. The large correction factors for surface charge densities necessary to make the experimental data fit the theoretical values stress the fact that some specific adsorption properties must be involved which are found to be partially due to organic matter and calcium carbonate. In the case of clay, the good agreement between the theoretical values and experimental data - with a correction factor of 1.6 for the surface charge density - is observed only above 50% Na saturation of the cation exchange capacity. At high Ca saturation of montmorillonite, specific adsorption energies are found to be dominant presumably due to tactoid formation.
