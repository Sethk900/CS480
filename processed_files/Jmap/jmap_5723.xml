Abundance, reproduction, and feeding of three species of British terrestrial planarians: Observations over 4 yearsOver 4 years, daily counts recorded 830 Microplana scharffi, 2752Â M. terrestris, and 108 of an unknown khaki Microplana species under wood, concrete, polythene, and a plank at a shaded site in a domestic garden. Numbers peaked in July and August. Microplana scharffi more often occurred under polythene, M. terrestris and the khaki species more often under wood. Cocoons peaked in June and July and hatchlings between July and September. Twelve M. terrestris cocoons yielded 50 hatchlings. Three M. scharffi cocoons yielded eight hatchlings. The time taken to hatch reduced from February to August. Earthworms accounted for 87% of M. scharffi prey. Microplana terrestris consumed earthworms, Arion hortensis and Discus rotundatus. Hatchling and unfed M. scharffi were yellow or cream. Fed individuals varied from pink to pale brown, depending on prey colour.
