Efficacy of systemic fungicides and timing of preventative sprays in the control of sugary disease of grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor)Eight systemic fungicides, benomyl, bitertanol, carbendazim/flusilazol, CG169374, procymidone, propiconazole, terbuconazole and triadimenol, were evaluated in two separate field trials during the 1989/90 and 1990/91 seasons to determine their efficacy against the control of sugary disease of sorghum with a single application. Disease reduction was limited on plants inoculated prior to the application of fungicides, suggesting that none of the chemicals had curative properties. Bitertanol, applied at 150 g a.i. and 300g a.i. ha−1 and procymidone, applied at 250 g a.i. ha−1, to coincide with flower opening, reduced disease incidence and resultant grain loss significantly. Residual activity of all chemicals was insufficient to protect the crop for the entire flowering period. The economic value of disease control by these fungicides is, therefore, questioned.
