Partitioning heterotrophic and rhizospheric soil respiration in a mature Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forestTotal belowground respiration (R-s) was partitioned into heterotrophic (R-h) and rhizospheric (R-s) respiration to determine the amount of CO2 originating from each component in a coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) forest. R-h was measured within cylinders from which roots, hyphae, and associated rhizosphere organisms were excluded by a 0.5 mu m nylon mesh and installed 50 cm into the soil. R, was 12 Mg C center dot ha(-1)center dot year(-1) and ranged from 0.71 to 6.57 g C center dot m(-2)center dot day(-1) during the 15 month experiment. R-h, was 7.8 Mg C center dot ha(-1)center dot year(-1), which contributed 65% of R-s mostly between May and August. R-r was 4.2 Mg C center dot ha(-1)center dot year(-1) (35% of R-s) and peaked in spring and fall. Soil temperature described the variability in R-s (p = 0.0004) better than soil moisture (p = 0.6156) and R-h was more closely related to temperature than was R-r. Values of Q(10) were 1.7 for R-s and 2.2 for R-h. We also assessed three potential sources of error associated with this root-exclusion technique: respiration from decaying severed roots, stimulated respiration as a result of cylinder installation, and lateral diffusion Of CO2 into cylinders. None of these artifacts were found to be significant sources of error in this experiment.
