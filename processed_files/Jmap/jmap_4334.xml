Effect of species, cutting position and exogenous rooting substances on rooting of honeybush (Cyclopia spp.) cuttingsEffect of the cutting position, terminal and subterminal, and rooting substance on the rooting of cuttings of two Cyclopia species (Cyclopia genistoides and C. intermedia) taken in winter, spring or summer was studied under controlled glasshouse conditions. Cuttings taken in summer, irrespective of the species, rooted better than cuttings taken either in winter or spring. This poor rooting performance of cuttings in winter and spring resulted in no significant treatment effects and for this reason only results of cuttings taken in summer are discussed. Cyclopia genistoides rooted significantly better than C. intermedia as measured by rooting percentage, number of roots per cutting, length of longest root and mean root length. Terminal cuttings from C. genistoides also increased rooting percentage and number of roots compared to subterminal cuttings, but not so in C. intermedia. Longest roots were produced by terminal cuttings irrespective of species. Treatment with different exogenous rooting substances as a main factor did not have any significant effect on rooting in this study.
