Spatial Distribution of Three Globose Cacti in Relation to Different Nurse-Plant Canopies and Bare AreasWe report the frequency of 3 globose cacti (Mammillaria cornea, M. haageana, and Coryphantha pallida) associated with nurse plants or bare areas and assess the size of plants in each site. We found 3 times more cacti established beneath nurse plants than in bare areas, and all cacti species were the same size when associated with shrub cover or bare areas. Under a plant canopy, the size structure was pyramidal, whereas in bare areas, individuals were found isolated with an even size structure, and few small plants were recorded. There was a positive relationship between the type of shrub cover and the associated globose cacti. We found more individuals of all 3 species of cacti associated with Prosopis laevigata than with Mimosa luisana, but size structure was similar between them. We discuss 2 possible scenarios that may result from the nurse-protege interaction.
