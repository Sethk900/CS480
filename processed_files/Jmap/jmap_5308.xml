New taxa of the family Trochometridiidae (Acari: Heterostigmata) associated with insects from IranA new genus and two new species of mites of the family Trochometridiidae (Acari: Heterostigmata) are described from Iran: Neotrochometridium sensillum Hajiqanbar and Khaustov gen. nov., sp. nov. associated with two carabid beetles and Trochometridium iranicum Hajiqanbar and Khaustov sp. nov. associated with a halictid bee. We also present the first report of two previously described species. These findings provide the first record of the family Trochometridiidae from Iran. The chaetotaxy of tarsus I of the family is discussed and a key to world genera and species is provided.
