Climate Change and Nutrition in AfricaClimate change is a threat to Africa, one of the most vulnerable regions to climate variability and change, due to its sensitive economies, multiple stresses, low resilience, endemic poverty, weak institutions, recurrent droughts, complex emergencies, and conflicts. Climate impacts African populations, economies, and the need for emergency resources. Climate change exacerbates undernutrition and undermines efforts to reduce poverty and the resilience of vulnerable populations, decreasing their ability to cope and adapt to negative consequences of climate change and inhibiting their economic growth, particularly in sub-Saharan countries. Recent drought-triggered famine in Somalia spurred food crises in other countries, demonstrating the consequences that may come with the increased frequency of extreme weather events. This article reviews the existing research on climate change and variability; its impacts on nutrition security in Africa, focusing on sub-Saharan Africa; and adaptation and mitigation strategies to address these challenges. This article identifies research needs in nutrition and related sectors to address the impacts that climate change will have on nutrition security in Africa and adaptation and mitigation strategies over the next 10â€“15 years.
