A new species and first record of the genus Triacanthella Sch√§ffer, 1897 (Collembola, Poduromorpha, Hypogastruridae) for AfricaAbstract The first species of the genus Triacanthella to be recorded from Africa is described. Triacanthella madiba sp. n. belongs to the Southern Hemisphere group of the genus. It is morphologically closely related to Triacanthella vogeli Weiner & Najt, 1997 from Chile, and appears to be a gondwanian relict. The new species is also the first Triacanthella recorded from a guano habitat.
