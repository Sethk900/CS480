Especies gemelas del genero Crepidula (Gastropoda, Calyptraeidae) en la costa de Chile; una redescripcion de C. dilatata Lamarck y descripcion de C. fecunda n. sp.Abstract According to differences in pattern of development, which have been discussed in a previous paper, two sibling Crepidula species are reported from the coast of Chile. On this basis, a redescription of C. dilatata Lamarck is done, this species being characterized by a direct development; only some of the eggs contained in each ovicapsule develop, the rest being nurse eggs. C. fecunda n. sp. is distinguished from the former by an indirect type of development ending with the hatching of numerous free living larvae. Both species are sympatric at some localities; at these places, females of C. fecunda are significantly larger than those of C. dilatata Lamarck. Brief information about both speciesâ€™ habitat, as well as localities at which they have been found is also given.
