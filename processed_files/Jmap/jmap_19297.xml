EFFECT OF LEAF- AND ROOT-LITTER MANIPULATION FOR CARBON-DIOXIDE EFFLUX IN FOREST SOILWe established it long-term field study in a sessile oak-turkey oak forest in Central Europe Hungary (Sikfokut Experimental Forest (SIK) to address how detrital quality and quantity control soil organic matter (SOM) accumulation and soil respiration. Due to the climate change the species composition of forest has been changing (Kotroczo et al., 2007), and the total leaf litter production has been slightly decreasing. According to our long-term litter manipulation field experiment, after a 5 year treating period, at the No Liner, No Root and No Input treatments the soil organic carbon, the soil pH, the soil enzyme activity (Fekete et al., 2007: Toth et al., 2007; Kotroczo et al., 2006) and soil respiration decreased. If the average soil temperature raise by 2 degrees C at the dry SIK site, the soil respiration would increase by 22.1%. The increasing soil respiration could speed Lip the global warming by positive feedback mechanism.
