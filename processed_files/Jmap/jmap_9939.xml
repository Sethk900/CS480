Dietary overlap of juvenile fall-and spring-run chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, in Coos Bay, OregonDuring the summer of 1987, dietary overlap (Schoener index) between juvenile fall-run chinook salmon, O. tshawytscha, and an introduced stock of juvenile hatchery-reared spring-run chinook salmon was high (0.32), indicating the potential for competition for food between these two groups in times of food scarcity. Both groups consumed a variety of prey. Diets of both salmon groups varied with fish size and capture location. Overlap was low between the smallest juvenile fall chinook salmon and all other length groups of both fall and spring chinook salmon. Dietary overlap between both salmon groups was high in the lower bay, and was also high in the mid bay. Three pieces of evidence are presented that suggest that the introduced hatchery-reared spring chinook salmon did not outcompete fall chinook salmon for food.
