Cave invertebrates in Espírito Santo state, Brazil: a primary analysis of endemism, threats and conservation prioritiesThe cave-dwelling invertebrates were studied according to their composition, biodiversity, distribution and threats in the Atlantic Forest Central Biodiversity Corridor, a priority area for conservation actions in Brazil. Twelve obligate cave species were found, plus 495 troglophile species. Araneae (103 spp.), Coleoptera (61 spp.), Diptera (56 spp.) and Lepidoptera (38 spp.) were the richest taxa. The richness was higher in the carbonate caves (63 spp., sd = 16.7) and the highest diversity in granitic caves (H´= 2.68, sd = 0.5). The spatial turnover was 63.45 and similarity less than 30%. The total richness was correlated with the linear extension of the caves (Rs = 0.757, p ≤ 0.05). Surrounding area deforestation and religious and tourist use were the main threats. Emergency attention is recommended regarding protective actions, management and conservation of caves of extremely high biological importance.
