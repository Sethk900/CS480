Using human-imprinted chicks to evaluate the importance of forbs to sage-grouseAlthough several studies have indicated the importance of forbs in brood habitats, no studies have quantified direct effects of the amount of forb cover on sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) chicks. In 2002 and 2003, we conducted field experiments in Middle Park and Moffat County, Colorado, USA, respectively. Our objective was to quantify effects of 3 levels of forb cover in brood habitat on mass gain and feather growth of human-imprinted sage-grouse chicks. The results indicate that increasing forb cover in brood areas with <20% forb cover may lead to increased chick survival and grouse productivity.
