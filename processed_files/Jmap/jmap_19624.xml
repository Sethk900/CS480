Effect of Grazing Pressure on the Structure of Rangeland Plant Community in MongoliaThe main cause of land degradation is overgrazing in Mongolia. The carrying capacity of rangeland is decreasing. Under heavy grazing, remarkable changes in plant functional type was detected from the perennial and palatable plants (Stipa krylovii, Agropyron cristatum, Allium Mongolicum) to the annual and unpalatable plants (Chenopodium acuminathum, Peganum nigelastrum).
