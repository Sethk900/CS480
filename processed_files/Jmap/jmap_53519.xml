A troglobitic amphipod in the Ice Caves of the Shawangunk Ridge: Behavior and resistance to freezingStygobromus allegheniensis Holsinger, 1967 (Allegheny Cave Amphipod) is a troglobiotic crustacean commonly found in caves of the Northeast United States. We describe several new populations from the unique tectonic Ice Caves found in the Shawangunk Ridge in New York, USA. Results also show that despite being an eyeless species, it can detect particular wavelengths of light and individuals display scotophilia, a preference for darkness. Finally, the Ice Caves pose a challenge to any aquatic troglobiont; in the winter months, the Ice Caves freeze and the floor and walls become covered in solid ice. Our results show that S. allegheniensis may seek warmer waters within the cave, but can also survive being frozen in solid ice.
