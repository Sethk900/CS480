Effect of fire on solute release from organic horizons under larch forest in Central Siberian permafrost terrainTo evaluate the effects of forest fire and post-fire stand recovery on the organic layer chemistry and solute release within mound and trough microrelief elements (termed earth hummock microtopography) that mainly distribute permafrost affected area, we chose five fire plots (larch forests burned in 1951, 1981, 1990, 1994 and 2005) paired with adjacent control plots in mature larch forests in Central Siberian permafrost terrain. We determined total carbon, nitrogen and ash content in solid organic soils, and analyzed total carbon, nitrogen, bases and major anions in water extracts. There was a significant correlation between water-extracted organic carbon (WEOC) and total carbon (kg mâˆ’2) in area basis, implying that the quantity of total carbon was a major factor in WEOC production. WEOC correlated negatively with pH, indicating strong control by organic horizons (organic solute leaching) on soil acidity and base cation dynamics. The sum of water extractable base cations was also correlated significantly to total carbon, indicating that cations can be released through organic matter decomposition. Organic horizons in troughs in burned plots released greater amounts of Ca, Mg and K than those in mounds, probably due to greater content of organic matter as a cation source. Anions including nitrate and phosphate and WEOC also accumulated in trough depressions, due probably to organic matter degradation. The contrasting distribution of solutes between mounds and troughs in burned plots seems to be controlled by organic horizon development via changes in microtopography after forest fires.
