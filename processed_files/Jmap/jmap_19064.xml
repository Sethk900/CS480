Soil respiration and affecting factors on the alpine tundra of Changbai Mountain.The relationships between soil respiration and biomass, litterfall, soil properties were investigated in the alpine tundra of Changbai Mountain. The results showed that the soil respirations of peat alpine tundra soil, meadow alpine tundra soil, gley alpine tundra soil and lithic alpine tundra soil were 250.79, 227.69, 211.36 and 209.42 g.m(-2).yr(-1) respectively. The underground biomass and soil respiration was significantly correlated (R-2 = 0.85, n = 15, P < 0.05). The spatial pattern of soil respiration and litterfall was not all the same for different vegetation types. The soil respiration was single-peaked for different vegetation types while litterfall was double-peaked. The main factors affecting soil respiration on the alpine tundra of Changbai Mountain was C/N, soil water capacity, soil organic matter, and total nitrogen, according to Canonical Correlation Analysis.
