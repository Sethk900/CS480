Winter Diet of Dusky-Legged Guan (Penelope obscura) at the Paraná River Delta RegionPenelope obscura, the southernmost species of the Cracidae family, reaches the southern limit of its distribution in the Paraná River Delta Region of Argentina. This area has been highly modified since the beginning of the twentieth century. A large proportion of the winter diet of Dusky-legged Guans in our study area was composed of exotic species, mainly Ligustrum sinense and L. lucidum. The absence of guans in nearby forests without Ligustrum spp. and the fact that these plant species are two of the few that fructify during the wintertime points at these introduced plant species as potential alternative resources for the guans.
