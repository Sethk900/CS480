Bird communities in different phytophysiognomies of the cerrado biomeThe Brazilian cerrado is a global biodiversity hotspot and one of the most poorly sampled regions in the Neotropics. We describe the bird community structure among the distinct cerrado phytophysiognomies and among different periods of the day, in five environments of this biome. Bird observations were carried out from October 2003 to March 2005, by visual and acoustical records, using transect and point-count surveys. We found a total of 128 species in the area, including six species endemic to the cerrado biome, and found evidence of breeding in nine species. The bird community differed significantly among phytophysiognomies. Our data show that, even at a small spatial scale, high richness, endemism and nesting are likely to be found in the cerrado. The variation in species occurrence also reveals the unique community structure of each cerrado habitat type over time, even if the same vegetal formations were considered between habitats. Our results support the decision to convert the study site into the first university cerrado conservation unit, since this will protect a broad range of species and will guarantee habitats for some endemic birds.
