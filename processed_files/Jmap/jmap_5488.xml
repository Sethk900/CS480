Population characteristics of four deepâ€water pandalid shrimps (Decapoda: Caridea) in the northern Aegean Sea (NE Mediterranean)The population characteristics of four deepâ€water pandalid shrimps (Decapoda: Caridea) were studied in the northern Aegean Sea in samples collected annually (1997â€“2000) in summer, through experimental trawl, at depths down to 600Â m. Females were larger than males in Plesionika martia and Plesionika heterocarpus; no significant differences in size of males and females were found in Chlorotocus crassicornis and Plesionika antigai. A trend of increasing size with depth was observed, as well as a linear increase in the proportion of females with increasing size. Sex ratio was skewed towards females at all depths in P. antigai, while in P. heterocarpus and C. crassicornis males dominated the intermediate depths. Negative allometries were apparent in the carapace lengthâ€“weight relationships in males of all species. Isometric relationships were found in females apart from in P. heterocarpus. The population patterns conform to relevant Mediterranean reports. However, some population differences exist that may reflect the distinct environmental conditions prevailing in the study area.
