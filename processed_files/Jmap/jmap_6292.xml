Can molybdenum reduce pre-harvest sprouting in wheat?The effect of foliar application of molybdenum (Mo) on grain dormancy was examined in six wheat cultivare at four sites. Application of 100 mg Lâˆ’1 Mo at flag leaf stage significantly increased grain Mo content at all sites and reduced germination at three sites. Alpha-amylase activity of the grain harvested from ears that had been subjected to 0, 12, or 24-h simulated rain was significantly reduced by the Mo application. Molybdenum also reduced grain nitrate concentrations in all cultivars at all sites. It is concluded that an application of Mo at the flag leaf stage will significantly ameliorate sprout damage in wheat.
