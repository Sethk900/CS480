A new fossil silky lacewing genus (Neuroptera, Psychopsidae) from the Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of ChinaAbstract A new genus and species, Undulopsychopsis alexi gen. et sp. n., is described from the Early CretaceousYixian Formation of western Liaoning Province, China. This genus is probably most closely related to the Asian Cretaceous genus Kagapsychops Fujiyama, 1978. The family affinity of Undulopsychopsis gen. n. is discussed. The genus is preliminarily assigned to Psychopsidae, although it shares some character states with Osmylopsychopidae (e.g., crossveins are very scarce; Rs1 and 1A are multi-branched).
