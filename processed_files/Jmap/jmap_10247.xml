Canopy Closure and Emigration by Juvenile Gopher FrogsAlthough studies have addressed effects of abrupt transitions in habitat\ntype (e.g., forest-clear-cut or forest-field edges) on amphibian\nmovements, little is known about effects of more subtle habitat\ntransitions on patterns of migration and habitat use in amphibians. We\nused radiotelemetry to study movement patterns of juvenile gopher frogs\n(Rana capito) emigrating from ponds that were surrounded by longleaf\npine (Pinus palustris) forest that varied in structure as a result of\nfire suppression. Our primary purpose was to determine if frogs emigrate\ndirectionally from their natal ponds and select habitat at random during\ntheir first month following metamorphosis. We found that frogs emigrated\nin nonrandom directions from ponds that were surrounded by heterogeneous\nhabitat and selected fire-maintained habitat that was associated with an\nopen canopy, few hardwood trees, small amounts of leaf litter, and large\namounts of wiregrass (Aristida beyrichiana). Fire-maintained habitat\ncontained higher densities of burrows excavated by gopher tortoises\n(Gopherus polyphemus) and small mammals, which are the primary refuge\nsites for both juvenile and adult gopher frogs. Frogs moved up to 691 m\nfrom their natal ponds, frequently crossed dirt roads, and even seemed\nto use these roads as migration corridors. To maintain suitable\nterrestrial habitat for gopher frogs, including habitat used by\nmigrating individuals, it is important to apply frequent prescribed fire\nto uplands surrounding breeding ponds that lead all the way to the edges\nof breeding ponds, as well as through ponds during periodic droughts.\n(JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT 73(2): 260268; 2009)
