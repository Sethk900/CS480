Regional Estimation of Storm Water Management Parameters in FloridaAbstractStorm water management parameters that are significantly influenced by local climatic conditions are the runoff coefficient (C) and the water-quality volume (WQV). Two classes of methods were investigated for estimating regional variations in C and WQV in Florida: interpolation methods and cluster-analysis methods. The results show that the inverse-distance-squared (IDW-2) interpolation method based on 45 reference stations distributed throughout the state provides the most accurate estimates of C and WQV, with a relative mean absolute error (RMAE) of 9% in estimating C and an RMAE of 13%â€“18% in estimating WQV. Although cluster means provide less accurate estimates of C and WQV, cluster analyses show that Florida can be divided into three regions with similar values of C and five regions with similar values of WQV. Cross validation shows that using cluster means instead of the IDW-2 method increases the RMAE by approximately 20% when estimating either C or WQV. A site-specific example illustrates the roles of C and WQV in the design of storm water management systems in Florida.
