Reply to Comment on Water footprint of marine protein consumptionaquacultures link to freshwaterAbstract In this reply to water footprint of marine protein consumptionaquacultures link to freshwater, we argue that Troell et als calculation of the water footprint of marine aquaculture supports our assumption that marine aquaculture requires a negligible amount of freshwater relative to the cost of terrestrial crop substitution that is the focus of our analysis in freshwater savings from marine protein consumption. We recognize that the water requirements of marine aquaculture could be important for specific countries and will likely become more important at the global level as aquaculture incorporates more terrestrially-based feeds and as aquaculture comprises a larger percentage of total marine fish production. In response to Troell et als comments on stagnant capture fisheries, we clarify that our original discussion encompassed several possible future conditions for these fisheries.
