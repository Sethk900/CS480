Estimating population features of the anomuran crab Petrolisthes armatus (Porcellanidae) in a remaining and impacted mangrove area of the western AtlanticThis study evaluated biological aspects of Petrolisthes armatus inhabiting a remaining but disturbed mangrove area of Brazil. Samples were taken from March 2005 to July 2006, during low tide in the rocky-shore region. The size frequency distribution for all the individuals collected was bimodal. The sex ratio obtained was not different from 1:1, and the population was classified as standard. A higher reproductive ratio and earlier ovigerous conditions were found in relation to another southern population; these can be hypothesized as adaptations to life in a stressed environment. Even though the population living in Araçá has been subject to an environment frequently disturbed by human-produced pollutants, our results show no sign of negative effects on reproductive stages, recruits or members of the population in general. The population profiles of P. armatus show some peculiarities when compared to other populations inhabiting non disturbed environments.
