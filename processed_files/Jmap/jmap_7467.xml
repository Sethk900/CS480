Nuevo hallazgo de Namanereis quadraticeps (Blanchard, 1849) en Chile (Annelida, Polychaeta, Nereidae)Summary A new finding of Namanereis quadraticeps (Blanchard, 1849) is reported from Chile. 34 specimens were collected in a salt marsh at Bahia Chinquiu, Puerto Montt (41° 32’ Lat. S. 73° 02’ Long.W) close to the type locality. Of all references to N. quadraticeps from other regions of the world only the specimens identified by Augener (1918), from Lüderitz Bay, South West Africa, agree with the specimens here reported. Most references to other regions may belong to species yet unnamed, since their descriptions differ from N. quadraticeps from Chile in the peristomial cirri and parapodial characters.
