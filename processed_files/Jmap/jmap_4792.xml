Habitat characterization and potential distribution of Tylototriton vietnamensis in northern VietnamThe habitat preferences of the endemic Vietnam Crocodile Newt, Tylototriton vietnamensis were investigated on two scales: (1) at Yen Tu Nature Reserve, Bac Giang Province, Vietnam, while compiling information about pond occupancy and developing a qualitative comparison among breeding sites and (2) by developing a Species Distribution Model based on climate and land cover data identifying further suitable habitats in northern Vietnam. A factor analysis followed by a multiple linear regression showed 94% support for our occupancy ranking model. Our results suggest that T. vietnamensis preferentially inhabits small pools with long hydroperiod and pH above 4.3. Suitable areas for the species have higher incidence in northern regions, where undisturbed vegetation and temperature-related variables seem to make greater contributions. Additionally, these potentially suitable areas are strongly fragmented and only a few are under IUCN protection, increasing their vulnerability towards further degradation.
