Effect of temperature on the germination of grain AmaranthAmaranthus cultivation in South Africa has potential commercial importance. To make optimal use of the growing season planting under cool soil conditions is often necessary. The effect of temperature on seed germination of A. hypochondriaeus (unknown landrace) and A. cruentus, was determined. Whereas overall germination was advanced by increasing the temperature, only A. hypochondriacus germinated abundantly at temperatures as low as 12°C. A. hypochondriacus had a germination percentage of 70% at 12°C while A. cruentus had a germination percentage of less than 1% at the same temperature.
