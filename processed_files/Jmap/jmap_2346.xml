Effects of Disturbance by Humans on Small Mammals in A Chihuahuan Desert EcosystemWe investigated the impact of disturbance by humans on distribution of small mammals at the northeastern edge of the Chihuahuan Desert. We determined composition of small-mammal communities and characteristics of soil at water tanks, roadsides, and open range. Nitrogen and moisture in soil did not vary across sites, but compaction of soil, vegetational cover, and composition of small-mammal communities did vary. Small mammals were distributed as expected with the exception of four omnivores (Mus musculus, Neoloma micropus, Peromyscus leucopus, and P. maniculatus), which were at higher density on sites with high disturbance by humans and relatively low vegetational cover. Activity of humans may impact some small mammals by drawing them to areas that contain high levels of human-generated resources.
