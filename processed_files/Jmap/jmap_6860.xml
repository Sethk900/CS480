Parasitism of Neotropical Tiger Beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae: Cicindelinae) by Anthrax (Diptera: Bombyliidae)Bee flies (Bombyliidae) were recorded as parasitoids of larval tiger beetles at two rain forest localities (near SÃ£o Paulo and Manaus) in Brazil. Anthrax gideon was reared from larvae of Oxycheila tristis. Up to 33 parasitoid larvae were found on a single tiger beetle host. Pupation of the bee fly took place in late August and the pupal stage lasted 14 days. The host digs horizontal burrows in contrast to the great majority of cicindelids, as does Pseudoxycheila tarsalis, the other known host of A. gideon. Two pupae of another undetermined Anthrax species were reared from larvae of Pentacomia ventralis in Central Amazonia. Pupation of this Anthrax sp. took place in October, the period of lowest host abundance.
