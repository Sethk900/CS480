Endogenous Reserves of Adult Male Sage Grouse during CourtshipLipid reserves of 116 adult (> 1 year of age) male Sage Grouse (Centrocercus  urophasianus) were evaluated in two Colorado populations during lek attendance between  1983 and 1986. Lipid reserves following winters (November-March) with snowfalls <124  cm were larger (P < 0.001) than reserves following winters with snowfalls > 160 cm. Lipid  reserves during early courtship were larger than reserves during late courtship (P < 0.001).  Males catabolized lipids during courtship but did not use breast muscle protein. Catabolism  of lipids likely provides < 5% of male energetic requirements during courtship. An adaptive  advantage to fat deposition before breeding may exist if males primarily mobilize lipids  during the peak period of female lek attendance when male reproductive success is determined, or during periods when thermoregulatory costs are high due to low ambient temperatures or wind.
