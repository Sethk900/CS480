THE FOOD HABITS AND SUMMER DISTRIBUTION OF JUVENILE SAGE GROUSE IN CENTRAL MONTANAThe food habits of juvenile sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) were studied in central Montana during the summers of 1966 and 1968. Forbs averaged 75 percent of the diet of 127 juveniles through 12 weeks of age. The flower buds and leaves of common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and common salsify (Tragopogon dubius) were the most highly preferred and utilized forbs, comprising 25 and 15 percent of the diets, respectively. Other forbs commonly utilized were prairie pepperweed (Lepidium densiflorum), prickly lettuce (Lactuca serriola), alfalfa (Medicago sativa), curlcup gumweed (Grindelia squarrosa), and fringed sagewort (Artemisia frigida). Big sagebrush (A. tridentata) received little use until the birds were 11 weeks old. Insect use declined steadily from a high of 60 percent of the diet in 1-week chicks to 5 percent in 12-week-old juveniles. Observed brood locations, after chicks were 2-3 weeks old, were less frequent on the sagebrush-grassland benches and more frequent on lower areas until, by September, the majority of broods were located on bottomlands. Sagebrush, 6-18 inches high, was most prevalent at brood sites used during morning and evening activity periods. Important components of juvenile sage grouse habitat in this area appear to be an abundance and diversity of forbs and densities of sagebrush ranging from 1-20 percent.
