Efficacy of fungicide seed dressings in the control of pre- and post-emergence damping-off and seedling blight of sorghumA field trial to determine the efficacy of captab seed dressing in reducing the incidence of pre- and post-emergence damping-off and the severity of seedling blight of sorghum was carried out. Tests on four commercial sorghum hybrids showed this fungicide to have no significant effect on these diseases. Eight other systemic fungicide seed dressings in various combinations and concentrations were screened in field trials at two localities. Most of the chemicals reduced pre-emergence damping-off but did not persist for long enough to control seedling blight as shown by mesocotyl and primary root discolourations or post-emergence damping-off. Only treatments containing furmecyclox, triadimefon or triadimenol were able to reduce the severity of all phases of the disease complex.
