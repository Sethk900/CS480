Soil organic carbon dynamics along a climatic gradient in a southern Appalachian spruce-fir forestA field study was conducted in a high-elevation spruce-fir (Picea rubens Sarg. - Abies fraseri (Pursh.) Poir) forest in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to assess the effect of temperature on soil C storage and dynamics. In eight plots along an elevation gradient (1500-1900 m), we measured soil temperature, forest floor and mineral soil C, litter decomposition, soil respiration, and forest floor mean residence time. Mean annual soil temperature and annual degree-days above 5 degrees C were inversely correlated with elevation. Total soil C (166-241 Mg-ha(-1)) showed no trend with elevation, while forest floor C accumulation (16.3-35.9 Mg-ha(-1)) decreased significantly with elevation. Carbon dynamics did not follow a consistent elevation pattern; however, the cooler upper elevations showed the lowest C turnover as indicated by the lowest needle decomposition rate (k = 0.0231.year(-)1) and the longest mean residence time of forest floor C (22 years). Mean annual CO2 efflux from the soil (1020-1830 kg C.ha(-1).year(-1)) was negatively correlated with mean annual soil temperatures and annual degree-days above 5 degrees C. This gradient study offers useful insights into C release patterns under future warming scenarios, and suggests that the highest elevation may be most susceptible to global warming.
