New genera and species of Urothoidae (Amphipoda) from the Brazilian deep sea, with the re-assignment of Pseudurothoe and Urothopsis to PhoxocephalopsidaeBox-corer samples taken between 700 and 2000Â m depth on the slope of the Campos Basin, southeastern Brazilian deep sea, provided the material for the description of two new genera in the family Urothoidae, Carangolioides gen. nov. and Coronaurothoe gen. nov., and three new species: Carangolioides castellatus sp. nov., Carangolioides hamatus sp. nov. and Coronaurothoe rotunda sp. nov. Carangolioides gen. nov. differs from other urothoid genera by the presence of a distolateral projection on the outer lobes of the lower lip and the distally truncated margin of the upper lip, while Coronaurothoe gen. nov. differs by the mandibular molar being triturative with a distal crown of stout setae. In this study, we provide detailed descriptions and illustrations of the new taxa. An identification key to genera of Urothoidae is also provided. The genera Pseudurothoe Ledoyer, 1986 and Urothopsis Ledoyer, 1967 are removed in this paper from Urothoidae to Phoxocephalopsidae.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:18863639-4F10-4E25-9C62-8B1047538046
