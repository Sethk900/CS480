Roadfill Revegetation in Semiarid Mediterranean Environments. Part II: Topsoiling, Species Selection, and Hydroseeding.Erosion is one of the main problems in roadfill restoration. Revegetation is widely used as a method to reduce erosion rates, and it is often carried out through hydroseeding. In semiarid Mediterranean conditions, this approach to revegetation often produces poor results due to climatic limitations. We evaluated whether (1) spreading topsoil and (2) hydroseeding with local rather than commercial species mixtures could improve the vegetative cover of roadfills. The study was carried out in 24 plots over a 20-month period. At the end of the study, vegetation cover was higher in topsoiled plots (38.8%) than in nontopsoiled plots (21.5%). Locally selected species produced higher vegetative cover (61.1%) than did standard commercial species (52.2%). After 20 months, the erosion index was not different among any treatment probably due to the low sensitivity of this variable. These results suggest that amendment of soils through the addition of topsoil is an important technique in roadfill revegetation in Mediterranean environments. Additionally, hydroseeding with local species will produce better vegetative cover on roadfills than does hydroseeding with available commercial species.
