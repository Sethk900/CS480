Marsh Deer (Blastocerus dichotomus) Distribution as a Function of Floods in the Pantanal Wetland, BrazilThe marsh deer (Blastocerus dichotomus, Cervidae) inhabits floodplains and marshlands of South America and is threatened with extinction. We conducted two aerial surveys in the central southern region of the Pantanal to evaluate population distribution at the end of the dry season and the peak of the flooding season. Our results show an aggregated distribution during the dry season and a relatively diffused distribution in the flooding season. Population density estimates are 0.382 ± 0.362 deer/km2 in the dry season, and 0.395 ± 0.144 deer/km2 in the flooding season. Population size remained essentially unchanged between the seasons. In the study area, the marsh deer moved up to 20 km between the dry and flooding seasons. The design of protected areas should consider migration distances to offer enough area to protect marsh deer populations throughout the year.
