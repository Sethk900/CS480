Amphipoda from marine caves of Hong Kong IslandA collection of 32 amphipod species from submarine cave habitats and control sites to the east of Hong Kong Island was made during a joint NHM/SWIMS expedition in October 2002. Three families (Caprellidae, Endevouridae and Kamakidae), nine genera (Monoliropus, Caprella, Paraloiloi, Leptocheirus, Microjassa, Cerapus, Listriella, Ensayara and Birubius) and 12 species (Monoliropus concavimanus sp. nov.; Caprella aff. penantis; Elasmopus sp. A; Ptilohyale aff. barbicornis; Cerapus sp. A; Paraloiloi sp. A; Ensayara bifurcata sp. nov.; Birubius nauarchuncus sp. nov.; Podocerus cluspiclunis sp. nov.; Megaluropus sp. A; Urothoe sp. A (aff. cuspis); and Urothoe aff. spinidigitus) can be added to the amphipod checklist for the South China Sea area.
