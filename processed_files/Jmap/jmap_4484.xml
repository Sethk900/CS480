Response of Lachenalia growing in soil to nitrogen fertilisation during the pot plant phaseLachenalia bulbs used in the pot plant industry are produced in the nursery phase from bulblets propagated from leaf cuttings. Fertilisation during this phase of enlargement can ultimately influence the growth and flowering of pot plants through the nutritional status of the bulbs. The objective of this study was to determine the response of cultivars (Rupert and Ronina) in the pot plant phase to different nitrogen levels when grown from bulbs whereof the fertilisation history is known. During the nursery phase bulblets of cultivars Rupert and Ronina received three nitrogen levels (0, 250 and 520 kg N ha−1) combined with two different application times. The resulting bulbs were planted in the pot plant phase and five nitrogen levels (0, 70, 180, 330 and 520 kg N ha−1) applied. Ronina leaf area responded better than Rupert when fertilised in the pot plant phase. The leaf area was also promoted by nitrogen applied in the nursery phase. Nitrogen applied in the nursery and pot plant phases influenced the number of florets formed per inflorescence positively. Only high nitrogen levels applied in the nursery phase (250 and 520 kg N ha−1) increased the peduncle length of the plants. Peduncle diameter was increased with an increase in nitrogen levels in the nursery phase as well as in the pot plant phase. This trial showed that Lachenalia has a low nitrogen requirement in the pot plant phase when grown from bulbs that were properly fertilised in the nursery phase but additional fertiliser in the pot plant phase improved the quality of the inflorescence.
