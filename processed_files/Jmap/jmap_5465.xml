New family and genus Rostrocalanus gen. nov. (Crustacea: Calanoida: Rostrocalanidae fam. nov.) from deep Atlantic watersTwo new species of a new genus and family Rostrocalanidae of benthopelagic clausocalanoid copepods are described from female specimens collected from abyssal depths close to the sea bed in the tropical Atlantic. Rostrocalanus gen. nov. shares the presence of sensory setae on maxilla with other bradfordian families of Clausocalanoidea, but does not fit the diagnosis of any of these families. A family Rostrocalanidae is established for this new genus and is defined by the following derived characters: fourâ€segmented exopod of mandible supplied with four setae; distal basal endite of maxillule fused to endopod and bearing five setae in total; endopod of maxilla furnished with six wormâ€like sensory setae; arrangement of setal numbers on praecoxal endites of maxilliped syncoxa as 0, 1, 2. The establishment of a new clausocalanoidean family sheds new light on the morphological diversity of bradfordian benthopelagic copepods and adds to the biodiversity of the deepâ€water calanoid fauna.
