Effects of Storage Conditions on Chromium (III) and Chromium (VI) in Two Types of Potable WaterAbstractThe effects of temperature, light exposure, and pH on the interconversion of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in two chlorinated drinking water samples (groundwater and surface water) over a 28-day period were investigated. Six conditions were tested including exposure to a grow lamp (29°C), overhead fluorescent light (20°C), no light (20°C), incandescent light (10°C), no light (4°C), and no light (−19°C). Each condition was tested at pH 7 and 9. No clear interconversion of Cr(VI) and Cr(III) was observed in either the groundwater or surface water under any of the storage conditions except for the surface water samples adjusted to pH 9. These samples provided firm evidence for the conversion of Cr(III) to Cr(VI) at temperatures of 29 and 10°C, with an increase in Cr(VI) concentration from an initial value of 2 ppb (μg/L) to a final value of 10 ppb over 28 days. Further research into whether conversion occurs at low temperatures is recommended to determine whether a hold time of 30 days (used in a standard method) is appropriate.
