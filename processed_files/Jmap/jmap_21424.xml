First report of the genus Kisaura Ross (Trichoptera, Philopotamidae) from India with the description of six new speciesAbstract The genus Kisaura Ross, 1956 (Trichoptera, Philopotamidae, Philopotaminae) is reported from India the first time. Six new species are described and illustrated: Kisaura elongata sp. n., Kisaura eloct sp. n., Kisaura clavata sp. n., Kisaura gangtokensis sp. n., Kisaura truncata sp. n., all from Gangtok (Sikkim) and Kisaura himachalica sp. n. from Barot (Himachal Pradesh). Male genitalia of this genus are distinguishable from those of other genera of the family by the pair of long lateral processes of tergum X, the well-developed mesoventral plates between two segments of the inferior appendages, and by the brush-like row of dark setae on the inner surfaces of the terminal segments (harpago) of the inferior appendages.
