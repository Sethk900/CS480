INDEPENDENT EFFECTS OF FOOD AND PREDATOR-MEDIATED PROCESSES ON ANNUAL FECUNDITY IN A SONGBIRD.We investigated the relative importance and interaction of ecological processes affecting annual fecundity in birds by simultaneously manipulating food availability and nest predation risk in a small songbird, the Wrentit (<em>Chamaea fasciata</em>). From 2000 to 2002 we provided supplemental food to individual Wrentit territories, and during 2002 we altered nest predation risk by providing supplemental food to their principal predators, Western Scrub-Jays (<em>Aphelocoma californica</em>). These experiments were conducted during a period of high interannual variation in rainfall, with 2002 being one of the driest years on record. Food-supplemented Wrentits in a normal predation environment produced an average of 0.54 more fledglings per year than control pairs over the three breeding seasons. During the feeding plus predation manipulation experiment, Wrentit food supplementation and lowered nest predation risk each independently increased the probability that a Wrentit pair would fledge young; however, the interaction between food supplementation and altered nest predation risk was not significant. Thus, even in an extreme drought year, both food and nest predation had equal but independent effects on reproductive success and annual fecundity. Combining supplemental food with reduced nest predation did not result in a synergistic increase in annual fecundity, primarily because Wrentits did not produce multiple broods. Our results suggest that whether food and predation have additive or synergistic effects on reproductive success depends on the life history of the species and the environment in which they live.
