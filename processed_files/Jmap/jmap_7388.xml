Immigration as a factor in maintaining populations of the sea urchin Lytechinus variegates (Echinodermata: Echinoidea) in seagrass beds on the southwest coast of Puerto RicoAbstract The abundance and size frequency distribution of the regular sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus in an extensive Thalassia testudinum bed on the southwest coast of Puerto Rico were studies for two years. Urchins were collected and measured at â€œdeepâ€; (3 m) and â€œshallowâ€; (1â€“1.5 m) stations at an eastern site (near Isla Guayacan) and a site 3.8 km to the west (Punta Pitahaya) in the same seagrass bed. There was little larval recruitment to the L. variegatus populations and their size frequency distributions remained relatively uniform both seasonally and annually. The L. variegatus at Pitahaya were consistently larger (median test diameter âˆ¼3.6 cm vs. 2.8 cm) but less abundant (âˆ¼4/m2vs. âˆ¼ 14/m2) than those at Guayacan. Comparisons of the size frequency data do not demonstrate growth by the L. variegatus. PrÃ©dation by the gastropod Cassis tuberosa was a significant source of urchin mortality at Pitahaya (minimum estimate 0.8 L. variegatus eaten/m2/yr.) but the urchin population there did not decline during the study. Larval settlement and juvenile recruitment at Pitahaya were negligible therefore the population must have been maintained by immigration. This study suggests that settlement of L. variegatus may be highly localized and that populations of this important grazer in seagrass beds can be dependent upon immigration.
