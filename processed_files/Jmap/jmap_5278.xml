Scutovertex alpinus Willmann, 1953 (Acari: Oribatida: Scutoverticidae) – redescription and geographical distributionScutovertex alpinus, a rare species, is redescribed in detail. This species is one of the smaller representatives of the genus with an average body length of 494 μm and a body width of 276 μm. Specific characters are a narrow, short, triangular median ridge between the narrow lamellae, sensillus clavate and spinose, distinct small cuticular foveae distributed over gastronotic region, and 10 pairs of short spiniform notogastral setae. Three pairs of notogastral saccules; a fourth saccule anterior notogastral seta h3 is developed asymmetrically in many cases. Leg chaetome: I (1-4-3-4-18), II (1-4-3-4-15), III (2-2-1-3-15), IV (1-2-2-3-12). Solenidia: I (1-2-2), II (1-1-2), III (1-1-0), IV (0-1-0). The comparison with several congeneric species points to a close relation to Scutovertex pileatus. Scutovertex alpinus inhabits mosses, cushion plants and tussocks in Alpine regions. The known geographic distribution is limited to Alpine regions of the eastern Alps and to one location in Germany (Harz).
