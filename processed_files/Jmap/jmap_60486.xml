Comparison of burned area estimates derived from SPOT-VEGETATION and Landsat ETM+ data in Africa: Influence of spatial pattern and vegetation typeAn algorithm for burned area mapping in Africa based on classification trees was developed using SPOT-VEGETATION (VGT) imagery. The derived 1 km spatial resolution burned area maps were compared with 30 m spatial resolution maps obtained with 13 Landsat ETM+ scenes, through linear regression analysis. The procedure quantifies the bias in burned area estimation present in the low spatial resolution burned area map. Good correspondence was observed for seven sites, with values of the coefficient of determination (R2) ranging from 0.787 to 0.983. Poorer agreement was observed in four sites (R2 values between 0.257 and 0.417), and intermediate values of R2 (0.670 and 0.613) were obtained for two sites. The observed variation in the level of agreement between the Landsat and VGT estimates of area burned results from differences in the spatial pattern and size distribution of burns in the different fire regimes encompassed by our analysis. Small and fragmented burned areas result in large underestimation at 1 km spatial resolution. When large and compact burned areas dominate the landscape, VGT estimates of burned area are accurate, although in certain situations there is some overestimation. Accuracy of VGT burned area estimates also depends on vegetation type. Results showed that in forest ecosystems VGT maps underestimate substantially the amount of burned area. The most accurate estimates were obtained for woodlands and grasslands. An overall linear regression fitted with the data from the 13 comparison sites revealed that there is a strong relationship between VGT and Landsat estimates of burned area, with a value of R2 of 0.754 and a slope of 0.803. Our findings indicate that burned area mapping based on 1 km spatial resolution VGT data provides adequate regional information.
