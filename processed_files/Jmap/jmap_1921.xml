Effects of experimentally imposed climate scenarios on flowering phenology and flower production of subarctic bog species.Climate scenarios for high-latitude areas predict not only increased summer temperatures, but also larger variation in snowfall and winter temperatures. By using open-top chambers, we experimentally manipulated both summer temperatures and winter and spring snow accumulations and temperatures independently in a blanket bog in subarctic Sweden, yielding six climate scenarios. We studied the effects of these scenarios on flowering phenology and flower production of <em>Andromeda polifolia</em> (woody evergreen) and <em>Rubus chamaemorus</em> (perennial herb) during 2 years. The second year of our study (2002) was characterized by unusually high spring and early summer temperatures.
