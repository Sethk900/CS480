Chironomus columbiensis n.sp. in South America and Chironomus anonymus Williston in North America â€ closely related SpeciesThe karyotype of the neotropical Chironomus columbiensis n.sp., as observed in the salivary gland chromosomes, has the unusual chromosome arm combination AG, BF, CD, E (columbiensisâ€complex). The chromosomal banding pattern is closely related to that of Chironomus anonymus (arm combination AE, BF, CD, G, pseudothummiâ€complex) in the southwest part of the United States and the Antilles. The reasons for describing C. columbiensis as a new species and for associating the second species with C. anonymus is discussed. The pupa of C. anonymus is described and adults are redescribed. It can be assumed that more relationships between North and South American Chironomus species will be found.
