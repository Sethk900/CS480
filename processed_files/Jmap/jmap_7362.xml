Ecological studies on intertidal and infralittoral brazilian tanaidacea (crustacea, peracarida)Summary Three species of Tanaidacea were found on the Â¡ntertidal and shallow infralittoral at Enseada do Flamengo, Ubatuba, southeastern Brazil. Their vertical and horizontal distributions, as well as their density, seasonal variation and constancy are studied in relation to substrate and degree of exposure to wave action. Leptochelia savignyi and Teleotanais sp. have their vertical distribution from the midlittoral to 5â€“6 m depth, and Zeuxo coralensis from the midlittoral to 1 m depth. Leptochelia savignyi and Zeuxo coralensis are present on exposed, semiâ€exposed and sheltered places, while Teleotanais sp. is absent from the last. The importance of the substrate as a factor influencing the distribution and the abundance of tanaids was again confirmed: sometimes the effect of the substrate is more significant on the animals than the wave action. The highest density of tanaids was found on the calcareous algae. Leptochelia savignyi is the most abundant species. There is some seasonal variation in the number of individuals in the littoral zone; higher numbers are found in September (late winter). The constancy and dominance of the species is calculated for the two zones, and Leptochelia savignyi is constant and dominant in both.
