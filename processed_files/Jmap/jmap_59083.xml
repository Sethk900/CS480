Estimation of Daily Solar Radiation from Measured Air Temperature Extremes in the Mid-Mediterranean AreaAbstractDaily solar radiation Rs at ground level is a necessary input variable required for the evaluation of evapotranspiration and crop growth, development, and yield-simulation models. Nevertheless, it is measured in few weather stations and at many locations it is not observed; also, available Rs temporal series are generally no longer than a few years. A valid surrogate of Rs measurement is the diurnal air-temperature range (ΔT); indeed, ΔT is inversely proportional to cloudiness and therefore could be a good indicator of atmospheric transmittance. As opposed to Rs, daily maximum and minimum air temperatures are measured at many locations and their observations in developed countries began in the 19th century. For this reason, several models that permit Rs indirect evaluation from air-temperature data have been suggested in the literature. The most famous models are the simple Hargreaves-Samani (HS) formula, many times recalibrated by the authors, and the Bristow-Campbell model, which has recently been improved. In this paper, the suitability of each proposed model is tested by comparing Rs real data, recorded in 33 Sicilian agrometeorological stations in the period 2003–2008, typically representing the Mid-Mediterranean area, with Rs estimates obtained by the models from ΔT data. In addition, a regional relationship is obtained for the scale coefficient K(T) of the Hargreaves-Samani formula: the relationship found improves Rs data prediction with respect to the original HS formulation.
