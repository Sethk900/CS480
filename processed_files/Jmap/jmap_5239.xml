A review of Coelotinae epigynal teeth morphology, with descriptions of two species from China (Araneae: Amaurobiidae)The morphology of the epigynal teeth of the spider subfamily Coelotinae is studied. Of the 460 coelotine species, 413 are known from females (261 have both sexes described and 152 have only females described) but six of them have incomplete epigynum data. Among the 407 species studied, six characters have been recognized that might be informative for the estimation of Coelotinae phylogeny, i.e. epigynal teeth: presence/absence, number, length, position on epigynum, separation from each other, and width. Their congruence with the current coelotine genera is discussed. Two coelotine species from Yunnan, China are described: Draconarius wrasei sp. nov. (female) and Draconarius immensus Xu and Li 2006 (both sexes). Both species are similar to the incertus group species in having a bifurcate conductor, simple median apophysis, prolaterally originated embolus in male, and in having a similar epigynum, absence of epigynal teeth, and short, more or less anteriorly extended spermathecae.
