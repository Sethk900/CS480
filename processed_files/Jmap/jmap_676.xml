Short-term variation in the isotopic composition of organic matter allocated from the leaves to the stem of Pinus sylvestris: effects of photosynthetic and postphotosynthetic carbon isotope fractionation.We aimed to quantify the separate effects of photosynthetic and postphotosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination on <em>&delta;</em><sup>13</sup>C of the fast-turn-over carbon pool (water soluble organic carbon and CO<sub>2</sub> emitted from heterotrophic tissues), including their diel variation, along the pathway of carbon transport from the foliage to the base of the stem.
