Rényi dimensions of soil pore size distributionThe existence of fractal scaling for pore volume-size distribution has been empirically shown, and several fractal models have been constructed to replicate it, deriving also other important physical properties. One step forward may be given by using multifractal analysis, which achieves a better characterization of a distribution by means of a singularity spectrum whenever suitable scaling properties are present. Rényi dimensions are a classical tool to characterize complex distributions that are closely related to the multifractal singularity spectrum but having an easier handling and interpretation. In this article, Rényi dimensions of pore size distributions are computed from data obtained by 2-D image analysis of soil samples. Analyzed samples show suitable scaling properties. The Rényi dimensions Dq appear defined with R2 greater than 0.95 within a significative range of q's. The variation of Dq with respect to q and the shape of the Rényi spectrum reveal that pore size distributions have properties close to multifractal self-similar measures. These results show that Rényi dimensional analysis is an appropriate tool for characterizing soil pore size distribution and thus may be used as indicator of soil structure as well as for deriving important soil physical properties. Moreover, this characterization opens the possibility of simulating the real distributions by adequate self-similar models of fractal geometry, as iterated function systems and related ones, with the corresponding benefits for prediction purposes.
