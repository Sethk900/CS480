Levee Layouts and Design Optimization in Protection of Flood AreasAbstractThis paper addresses a possible decrease in flood damages by using structural methods and determines proper locations (layout) to construct protective levees and height of levees (design of levees) in high-risk areas. Because of discontinuity of the objective function and a large number of decision variables, the optimization uses the genetic algorithm (GA). The simulation of the region is carried out with the Hydrologic Engineering Center’s River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) model. The GA is employed to maximize the benefit of flood control and also to minimize the cost of protective levees’ construction. Thus, the fitness function of the algorithm maximizes the net benefit of the project. After a sensitivity analysis, mutation and crossover probability are assumed to be 0.03 and 0.7, respectively. Thus, 1,000 generations and 98 chromosomes for each run are considered. The optimization model is run 5 times for floods with return periods of 50 and 100 years. Furthermore, the algorithm is used to evaluate flood damages in the Sarm and Khoor Abad River, located in the Qom province of Iran. Project net benefits resulting from the optimization model for rivers using 100-year flood exceed those for a 50-year flood. Results indicate that construction of protective levees reduces the rate of damages up to 99% in comparison with a nonconstruction of levees scenario. By taking into account the construction cost of levees, net benefits decrease by 0.97% and 1.1% for floods with 50-year and 100-year return periods, respectively.
