Spatial Accumulation and Strength of Affiliation of Heavy Metals in Bioretention MediaAbstractOn-site sequestration and accumulation of heavy metals in bioretention cells introduces the potential for short- and long-term management concerns regarding the metals’ environmental availability, human health impacts, and implications for maintenance practices. Media samples from a 4-year-old bioretention cell were collected across the cell surface and to a depth of 90 cm to assess the spatial distribution of accumulated lead, copper, and zinc in the media. Analyses consisted of total metal, a five-step sequential extraction, bioavailable lead, and media pH and organic matter content. Metal concentrations in the media have increased substantially over the original levels but are well below regulatory cleanup thresholds. Metals are strongly bound to bioretention media and are largely immobile. Lead bioavailability is comparable to generic soil estimates. Most metal accumulation is near the inflow point in the top 3–12 cm of media. Based on trends observed after 4 years of operation, many years of capacity are estimated to remain in the cell with respect to metals. Regulatory cleanup thresholds are likely to be first reached at a localized hotspot near the inflow point, although routine maintenance actions may be able to delay attainment of such thresholds indefinitely.
