One species, two strategies? Oviposition site variation in a member of the Leptodactylus pentadactylus group (Amphibia: Anura: Leptodactylidae)Many different reproductive strategies have been documented in anurans. In particular, in the family Leptodactylidae, oviposition strategies range from aquatic to terrestrial, based on eggs in foam nests. However, information on reproductive site variation within the same species is scarce. During an inventory and ecological study of amphibians in the lowlands of Bolivia, we recorded two populations of a member of the Leptodactylus pentadactylus species group. Analyses of tadpole morphology and DNA barcoding provided evidence for a conspecific status of both populations, assigned to L. vastus. One population showed semi-aquatic oviposition, whereas we assume both semi-aquatic and terrestrial egg deposition in the other population, the terrestrial reproductive mode being associated with termite mounds. We discuss deficient oviposition, populations with fixed reproductive strategies or a case of reproductive mode plasticity as possible interpretations.
