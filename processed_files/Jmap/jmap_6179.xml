Development of integrated control strategies for wattle. II. Control of unwanted wattleFour integrated control strategies were developed for wattle that could not be removed for utilization. In the first two strategies, a combination of mechanical and/or chemical control methods either reduced the wood biomass in situ (fell, stack and burn) or retained the wood biomass above the soil surface (control of standing trees). Follow-up control involved a combination of chemical control and burning high fuel loads of sown pastures species. For the third strategy, dense infestations were contained and prevented from encroaching into neighbouring veld (grasslands). These infestations were controlled once sufficient funds became available, or converted to wood lots and shelter belts. The fourth strategy describes control of dense seedling regeneration promoted by uncontrolled fire, and the calculation of a reserve ‘fire fund’. A customized management plan was developed for a particular property that assigned these six integrated control strategies to infestations in different situations. Prioritizing the infestations allowed the optimum allocation of the available resources within a realistic time span, thereby ensuring sustained progress was made in the reduction of infestations to acceptable levels.
