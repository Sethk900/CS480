Reproductive behaviour of Physalaemus kroyeri (Anura: Leiuperidae) in the municipality of Jequié, state of BahiaFrom August 2010 to April 2011 we surveyed two different areas, located in the municipality of Jequié, State of Bahia, to obtain information about the reproductive biology of Physalaemus kroyeri. Data on the spatial and temporal distribution of P.  kroyeri were recorded. Physalaemus kroyeri may be classified as a prolonged breeder with a reproductive period linked to rainfall. The average number of eggs in the foam nest of P. kroyeri is one of the highest recorded for the genus. Our results are coincident with the known reproductive behaviour of congeneric species and may be viewed as reproductive adaptations to open and highly seasonal environments.
