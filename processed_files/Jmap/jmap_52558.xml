Mode of use of sexually dimorphic glands in a Neotropical harvestman (Arachnida: Opiliones) with paternal careMales of Iporangaia pustulosa (Arachnida: Opiliones) have a sexually dimorphic metatarsus IV, which is thicker and with more glandular pores in males. Here we tested the hypothesis that this glandular area is used by males to leave chemicals in the environment, predicting that the animals would rub the metatarsus IV against the substrate. We have made recordings both in the field and in the laboratory, in several distinct contexts during the day and at night, comprising 67Â hours of observations. We also experimentally tested the reaction of both sexes to a filter paper rubbed on the metatarsus gland, with adequate controls. We report and describe for the first time that the metatarsal gland of I. pustulosa is used to leave chemicals on the substrate by rubbing or touching it against the substrate. We also provide evidence that males can control the release of secretions of the metatarsal gland IV.
