Relationships between micromorphological soil features and known stratigraphic layers in Western AustraliaMicromorphological data were collected from a known layered situation in south western Australia in an effort to determine whether pedological features and soil fabrics could provide a basis for identifying the presence of rock- and soil-stratigraphic units in whole soil profiles. The use of depth functions as a basic micromorphological research technique is evaluated with regard to the recognition of sedimentary characteristics in soils and the identification of strarigraphic discontinuities. Results of this study suggest that multiple peaks in frequency-distribution patterns of pedological features are indicative of polygenesis because each peak correlates with a surface (contemporary) or buried (relic) soil profile. The analysis of soil fabric assemblages appears to provide an additional basis for differentiating soil materials. The recognition of inherited soil features facilitates tracing the provenance of soil parent materials.
