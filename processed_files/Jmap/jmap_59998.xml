Finite-Element Analysis of Stress Concentration around Dowel Bars in Jointed Plain Concrete PavementAbstractStresses in the concrete surrounding dowel bars is a major factor that contributes to transverse joint distress in jointed plain concrete pavement (JPCP). In this study, a distribution of stresses around dowel bars was analyzed with special attention to compressive and tensile stresses, which are responsible for cracks’ initiation and propagation. Calculations considering diameter, spacing, and length of dowels in JPCP were made using the finite-element method (FEM). Sliding interfaces with friction that permit separation between dowels and surface concrete were modeled using the full cylindrical surface between each dowel and the surrounding concrete. Practical functional relationships among the studied parameters may be useful in the calculation of maximal stresses in concrete around a dowel bar in dependence on its characteristics. Knowledge about the mechanical behavior of dowel bars at their contact with concrete is important to develop effective doweled joints and to improve the load transfer efficiency (LTE). It was also shown that permissible tensile stresses in concrete may be exceeded for dowel diameters <0.04  m, length 0.5 m, and distances >0.30  m. Based on derived empirical equations and relationships, it is possible to calculate stresses around dowels for different diameters, length, and spacing for a selected concrete pavement. They may be useful in a design of the pavement.
