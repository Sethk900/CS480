A revision of the neotropical beetle genus Isanopus Sharp, 1876 (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae: Staphylinini)The xanthopygine staphylinid genus Isanopus Sharp, 1876 is revised. Three species are described as new, I. ashei sp. n. from Costa Rica and Panama, I. eptaskouros sp. n. from Peru, and I. hinojosai sp. n. from Costa Rica and Panama. A lectotype is designated for I. sahlbergi Bernhauer, 1917. Distribution maps, a key and illustrations of structural features are provided for the identification of species. Phylogenetic analysis of six ingroup and two outgroup taxa based on 19 characters produced a single most parsimonious tree (tree length = 24, CI = 1.0). The monophyly of Isanopus is supported by high bootstrap and Bremer support values.
