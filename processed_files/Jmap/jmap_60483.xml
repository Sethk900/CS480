Satellite mapping of CO emission from forest fires in Northwest America using MOPITT measurementsWe present a study on MOPITT (Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere) detection of CO emission from large forest fires in the year 2000 in the northwest United States. Fire data used are from the space-borne Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) at 1-km resolution. The study shows that MOPITT can reliably detect CO plumes from forest fires whenever there are >30 AVHRR hotspots in a 0.25Â°Ã0.25Â° grid, which is comparable to the pixel area of MOPITT in the region. The spatial CO pattern during the fire events is found to be consistent with the location and density of AVHRR hotspots and wind direction. While the increase of CO abundance inside the study area is closely correlated to the AVHRR-derived hotspot number in general (R>0.75), the non-linearity of fire emission with fuel consumption is also observed. MOPITT can also capture the temporal variation in CO emission from forest fires through 3-day composites so it may offer an opportunity to enhance our knowledge of temporal fire emission over large areas. The CO emission is quantitatively estimated with a one-box model. The result is compared with a bottom-up approach using surface data including burnt area, biomass density, and fire emission factors. If mean emission factors for the region are used, the bottom-up approach results in total emission estimates which are 10%â50% lower than the MOPITT-based estimate. In spite of the limitations and uncertainties addressed in this study, MOPITT data may provide a useful constraint on uncertain ground-based fire emission estimates.
