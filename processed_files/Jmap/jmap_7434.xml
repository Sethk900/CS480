Zum Fund von Platychirograpsus typicus Rathbun 1914 (Crustacea, Decapoda, Brachyura) in MexicoSummary Discoveries of the rare sweetwaterâ€crab Platychirograpsus typicus are hitherto known from Tabasco and Veracruz (Mexico). A new male specimen was found at the Rio de Alatorre. The crab lived under a stone in a quiet area of the river. The cave where the crab dwelled was closed and defended by its mighty pair of scissors. Footprints prove that Platychirograpsus typicus does not move far away from its living place.
