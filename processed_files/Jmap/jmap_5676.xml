Synopsis of the life cycles of Digenea (Platyhelminthes) from lagoons of the northern coast of the western MediterraneanThe present document reports on the large amount of data relating to digenean parasites recorded from or known to be present in various hosts in lagoons of the northern coast of the western Mediterranean, which has been compiled from the literature of more than a century. In these lagoons, at least 72 nominal species of digeneans have been recorded. This total corresponds to approximately 12% of the 584 â€œmarineâ€ digenean species reported for Europe. Data are provided on the life cycles of 56 digenean species. The life cycle has been totally elucidated for 44 species (25 from fish, 19 from birds), and partly for the other 12 species (seven from fish, five from birds). This means that the life cycle is known for 61.1% of the recorded fauna (44/72) and partly for 16.7%, but remains unknown for 22.2%, making it, in this respect, one of the best understood digenean marine faunas in the world. In addition, a checklist is provided dealing with the cercarial and metacercarial forms recorded from lagoons of the northern coast of the western Mediterranean, which have been described only on the basis of characters of these larval stages and which remain without demonstrated links to a corresponding sexual adult stage in a vertebrate.
