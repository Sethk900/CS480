Litter dams and microterraces formed on hillslopes subject to rainwash in the Sydney Basin, AustraliaObservations of the results of erosion on hillslopes destabilized by fire were made over various periods up to 4.5 years in the Sydney Basin, Australia. On many sites a microrelief form of litter dams and microterraces were noted and the conditions favouring their formation identified. Litter dams formed during the first runoff event after the fire. In normal conditions they stabilized rapidly then slowly deteriorated over 3 or 4 years. A general model of litter dam and microterrace morphology and sedimentology is presented and their significance in the genesis of hillslope soils is discussed.
