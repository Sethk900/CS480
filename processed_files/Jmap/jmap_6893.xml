Seasonal Food Resources of the Squirrel Sciurus ingrami in a Secondary Araucaria Forest in Southern BrazilIn a field study carried out over one year in a secondary Araucaria forest in eastern Paran√ State, Brazil, foraging was observed in a population of the squirrel Sciurus ingrami. Seeds of Araucaria and about ten more species of native and exotic trees were the main food items besides mushrooms and fruits. Not all seeds were consumed immediately. Especially in autumn and winter, a large portion was cached, in particular of the Araucaria seeds. The relevance of this behaviour, well known in squirrels, for seed dispersion and forest regeneration is discussed.
