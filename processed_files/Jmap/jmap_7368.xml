Age and growth of Basilichthys Australis Eigenmann 1927 in Rapel Reservoir, Chile. (Pisces, Atherinidae)Abstract The scale reading method was used to calculate present and back age of B. australis captured monthly during a 19â€month period at Las Balsas, Rapel Reservoir Chile. Three age groups were determined: group I from 130 to 210 mm T.L., group II from 210 to 250 mm T.L. and group III from 250 to 280 mm T.L. The Von Bertalanffy model and Walford's method were used as a mathematical expression of growth. Growth equations are: The maximum theoretical calculated age was 4.8 years for females and 3.3 years for males. It is postulated that this species has a rapid growth and a short life span at the site studied.
