Descriptions of Pelodera scrofulata sp. nov. and Pelodera aligarhensis sp. nov. (Nematoda: Rhabditidae) with supplementary information on Pelodera teres (Schneider, 1866).Pelodera scrofulata sp. nov. is characterized by cuticle with longitudinal lines and punctations; offset lip region with separate lips, wider in females, moderately developed cheilostom, presence of glandular bodies associated with uterus, tail conoid to spicate; males with spicules fused up to 60–68% from distal end; peloderan bursa with two precloacal papillae 9–12 μm apart and seven postcloacal pairs in the configuration of 1 + 1/4 + P + 2 + 1. Pelodera aligarhensis sp. nov. is characterized by sexual dimorphism in anterior body region; cuticle often with faint longitudinal lines; slightly offset lip region; tail cupola-shaped; males with spicules fused up to 20-25% from distal end; peloderan bursa; one precloacal pair at anterior level of cloaca; two precloacals shifted posteriad to the cloacal level; seven postcloacal pairs of genital papillae in 1/2 + (2 + P) + (3 + 1) configuration. Some new information is added to the description of Pelodera teres (Schneider, 1866) with special reference to labial structure.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:91E78F4F-08F2-45DE-B6A6-91F4E42011FF
