Revision of the genus Paridea Baly, 1886 from Taiwan (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae, Galerucinae)Abstract The Taiwanese species of the genus Paridea Baly, 1886, are revised. Two new species, Paridea (Semacia) houjayi sp. n. and P. (S.) kaoi sp. n. are described. Both were confused previously with P. (S.) sexmaculata (Laboissière, 1930) and P. (S.) angulicollis (Motschulsky, 1854) respectively. Paridea (P.) sauteri (Chûjô, 1935) and P. (P.) taiwana (Chûjô, 1935) are removed from synonymy with P. (P.) sinensis Laboissière, 1930. The synonymy of Paraulaca flavipennis Chûjô, 1935 with Paridea (Paridea) testacea Gressitt & Kimoto, 1963 is supported. Paridea (Semacia) nigrimarginata Yang, 1991 is regarded as a junior synonym of P. (S.) angulicollis and excluded from the Taiwan fauna. Lectotypes are designated for Paraulaca costata Chûjô, 1935, P. flavipennis Chûjô, 1935, P. taiwana Chûjô, 1935, Semacia nipponensis Laboissière, 1930, and Paridea sinensis Laboissière, 1930.
