Meiocardia agassizii Dall, 1886 in the Brazilian Littoral (Mollusca â€” Bivalvia)Summary Meiocardia agassizii Dall, 1886 is a bivalve that belongs to the family Glosâ€sidae, Gray 1847. Described by Dall in 1886, it was dredged by the U.S. Fish Commission off Trinidad from a depth of 210 m. The same species was dredged for the first time in the South Atlantic off the mouth of Rio Doce, Espirito Santo, Brazil. As the specimen was well preserved the study of the soft parts was possible. The mantle, siphons and the organs of the mantle cavity were described and compared to those of Glossus humanus, which belongs to the same family.
