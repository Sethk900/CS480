A new species of mycophagous Rentonium (Coleoptera: Cleroidea: Trogossitidae) based on larvae and adults, and a catalogue of RentoniinaeAdults and associated larvae of Rentonium bicolor sp. nov. are described from New Zealand (North Island) and represent the first associated larvae of the Rentoniinae. Larvae and adults were found among the fruiting bodies of Hypocrea rufa (Pers.) Fr. (Ascomycota: Hypocreaceae). The larvae are morphologically similar to a previously described and undetermined larva but differ from it by the unpaired, hook-like urogomphus, four stemmata, and the apical antennal seta subequal in length to the antenna. Potential implications for phylogeny of Cleroidea are discussed. A catalogue of the genera and species of Rentoniinae is provided, along with comments about the status of Rentonellum loebli KolibÃ¡Ä.http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:936541AB-1802-4C09-9032-7EF1FAAC912E
