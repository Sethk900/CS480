Mapping of understory lichens with airborne discrete-return LiDAR dataHigh backscatter reflectance at NIR wavelengths has been observed for reindeer lichens (Cladina sp.) in the laboratory. The results suggested that lichens could be separated from soil and other parts of forest understory using this property. An experiment was carried out to test this hypothesis in situ. The lichen vegetation of a 960-m2 plot in a barren pine stand in Juupajoki, Finland was mapped in 3D, using methods of close-range photogrammetry. The data of two airborne discrete-return sensors were compared for their ability to classify understory lichen vegetation. Normalization of the LiDAR intensities was carried out, using natural targets. The results showed that lichen surfaces had a higher intensity than on average. Normalization of the intensities improved separability of lichens from other surfaces, and the best-case classification accuracy was 75%. Detailed analysis of geometric errors revealed small, decimeter-level planimetric offsets in the LiDAR datasets that affected the results notably.
