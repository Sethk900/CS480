Soil carbon dioxide flux in Antarctic dry valley ecosystemsThe Antarctic dry valleys of southern Victoria Land are extreme desert environments where abiotic factors, such as temperature gradients, parent material, and soil water dynamics, may have a significant influence on soil carbon dioxide (CO2) flux. Previous measurements of soil respiration have demonstrated very low rates of CO2, efflux, barely above detection limits. We employed a modified infrared gas-analyzer system that enabled detection of smaller changes in CO2 concentration in the field than previously possible. We measured diel CO2 fluxes and monitored soil microclimate at three sites in Taylor Valley. Soil CO2 flux ranged from -0.1 to 0.15 mumol m(-2) s(-1). At two of the three sites, we detected a physically driven flux associated with diel variability in soil temperature. At these sites, CO2 uptake (negative flux) was associated with dropping soil temperatures, whereas CO, evolution (positive flux) was associated with increases in soil temperature. These observations are corroborated by laboratory experiments that suggest that CO2 flux is influenced by physically driven processes. We discuss four potential mechanisms that may contribute to physically driven gas exchange. Our results suggest there are strong interactions between biological and abiotic controls over soil CO2 flux in terrestrial ecosystems of the Antarctic dry valleys, and that the magnitude of either may dominate depending on the soil environment and biological activity.
