Patterns of morphometric variation in the smooth newt (Lissotriton vulgaris) from Greece: environmental correlatesMultivariate analyses were applied to an array of body measures of smooth newt specimens derived from 14 local populations of two subspecies in Greece, in order to describe, analyse and detect patterns and putative causes of amongâ€population morphometric variation. The two subspecies do not differ morphometrically, in spite of their considerable genetic differentiation. Paedomorphosis explains a significant portion of the observed morphometric differentiation of populations. Differences between the two morphs refer mostly to characters and structures relevant to feeding and locomotion, which might lead to niche segregation and subsequent reduction of intraâ€population competition. Body size varies in relation to altitude probably as a result of differential developmental processes or as an environmentally induced response to varying predation pressures. Variation of different aspects of the external morphology is correlated both to climatic factors and habitat characteristics.
