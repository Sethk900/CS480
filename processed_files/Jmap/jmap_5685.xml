Revision of the genus Sinochlora Tinkham (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae, Phaneropterinae)The genus Sinochlora Tinkham [type species Sinochlora longifissa (Matsumura and Shiraki)] (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) is revised. Six new species, S. nonspinosa sp. nov., S. trapezialis sp. nov., S. tibetensis sp. nov., S. mesominora sp. nov., S. retrolateralis sp. nov., S. aequalis sp. nov., and the male of S. hainanensis are described. S. gracilisulcula Shi and Zheng, 1996 and S. kiangsuensis Tinkham, 1945 are synonymized with S. szechwanensis Tinkham, 1945. Holochlora voluptaria Carl, 1914 is transferred to the genus Sinochlora. The significance of each taxonomic character is discussed. Characteristics of the male epiproct of most species are firstly studied in detail and considered most important and relied on to distinguish species. Some known species are redescribed based on the characters of the male epiproct and male stridulatory area. The map of geographical distribution with GIS is drawn, and the possible patterns of distribution are discussed. A key to the 13 known species in the world is provided.
