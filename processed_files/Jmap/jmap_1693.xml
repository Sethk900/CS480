Effects of density and floral morph on pollen flow and seed reproduction of an endangered heterostylous herb, Primula sieboldii.<ol><li>We assessed the effects of population density and the spatial arrangement of genetically compatible mates on the seed set and pollen flow of a heterostylous, bumblebee-pollinated perennial, <em>Primula sieboldii</em> E. Morren (Primulaceae), by using an experimental population under natural pollination conditions.</li><li>We also examined the intermorph differences in the pollen dispersal distance and the frequency of self- and intramorph fertilization.</li><li>Seed set was significantly correlated with the number of opposite-morph flowers within 2 m in short-styled genets, and within 3 m in long-styled genets.</li><li>Mean pollen dispersal distance within the experimental population was 5.4 m, which was slightly shorter than that in a low-density population measured in a previous study (7.2 m).</li><li>The proportions of seedlings sired by the same morph or selfed were 10.2% and 3.0%, respectively, in long-styled mothers, compared with 1.9% and 0.0% among short-styled mothers. However, these differences were not statistically significant and no marked differences in pollen dispersal distances were observed between the two morphs.</li><li>Our results suggest that the presence of opposite-morph genets within several metres is essential for success of seed reproduction in <em>P. sieboldii</em>, irrespective of population density, and that stochastic deviation of the morph ratio in small populations is therefore likely to cause considerable reduction in seed set.</li></ol>
