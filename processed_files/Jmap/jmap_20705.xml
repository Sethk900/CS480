From Corsica to Britain: new outdoor records of Ocnerodrilidae (Annelida: Clitellata) in western EuropeAbstract The ocnerodrilids Eukerria saltensis (Beddard, 1895) and Ocnerodrilus occidentalis Eisen, 1878 are reported for the first time from outdoor localities above 42Â° N in Europe. The present new records comprise the first ever from England (River Thames, central London) and from France (River Golo, northern Corsica) and the northernmost occurrences in Italy (Liguria and Veneto). The new latitudinal limits and the numerosity of outdoor records suggest that the current environmental and climate changes are substantially enhancing the dispersal and survival possibilities of these worms, even though different transport vectors seem to be involved for the two species.
