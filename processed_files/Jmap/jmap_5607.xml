Larval development of Pandalus gracilis Stimpson (Crustacea: Decapoda: Pandalidae) reared in the laboratoryThe complete larval development of Pandalus gracilis Stimpson is described based on larvae reared in the laboratory. The species has four larval stages (stages 1–4) and one postlarval stage (stage 5). The survival rate of the postlarva stage is very high. Of the 40 larvae reared individually, 39 larvae moulted to the postlarva stage within approximately 21 days at a rearing temperature of 15°C. Larval morphological characteristics of the species are described and figured. Larval development of P. gracilis is compared with other Pandalus and Pandalopsis species. Komai (1999) divided species of Pandalus into four species groups based on adult morphology. Pandalus gracilis belongs to the P. hypsinotus group. In this study, using larval characters, the P. hypsinotus group can be divided into two groups by the appearance of the mandibular palp and the shape of the telson: the first group contains P. hypsinotus and P. danae, and the second group contains P. gracilis, P. prensor, and P. nipponensis.
