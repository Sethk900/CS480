Iron oxides and clay minerals within profiles as indicators of soil age in Northern ItalyNine profiles representing the Alfisol, Inceptisol and Entisol orders were sampled on three terraces forming a chronosequence. Total iron, dithionite-extractable iron and oxalate-extractable iron were determined for all horizons of all profiles, and the clay mineralogy for horizons of three profiles. The percentage of total Fe (Fet) extracted by dithionite (Fed) increased with age of terraces, as did the difference between Fed and Feo (oxalate-extractable). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the horizon data showed that the ratios Fed/Fet and Fedî—¸Feo/Fet were closely related to the ages of the terraces. Clay minerals were also related to terrace ages, with 2:1 minerals dominant in the profiles on the youngest and mixed-layer minerals and kaolinite more abundant in profiles on the older terraces.
