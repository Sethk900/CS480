Characterization of a Scottish doppleriteA dopplerite found in a sand quarry near Strathaven, Strathclyde comprises mainly high molecular weight organic materials about 2850 years old. It superficially resembles humic acid in its acid and alkali solubility characteristics and in its elemental C, H, N and O composition. Its ash contains substantial amounts of Ca, Fe and Al. In these respects it resembles earlier data for dopplerite found in Europe and America. Infrared spectroscopy and acid hydrolysis, however, showed that the sample, which is poorly humified, more closely resembles sphagnol, a lignin-like polymer from Sphagnum, than a conventional humic acid. Its most likely origin is therefore from Sphagnum moss and the low N content is consistent with this interpretation.
