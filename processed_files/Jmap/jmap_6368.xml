Wheat cultivar identification by electrophoretic analysis of gliadin proteinsPolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of gliadin proteins in an acid medium was used to identify different spring wheat cultivars. Gliadins were extracted from single kernels or corresponding flour samples using different solvents. Gliadin electrophoretogram formulae using relative band mobilities and staining intensities were determined for each cultivar. Distinctive band patterns were obtained enabling the cultivars to be identified. Single kernels and flour samples gave identical band patterns differing only in the intensity of the staining of the bands.
