Soil and physiographic characteristics important to mango production on Vertisols, IsraelThe suitability of heavy clayey Vertisols on slopes surrounding Lake Kinneret for mango production was investigated over a 2-year period. Thriving mango plantations were observed on most of the Vertisols, but on some sites the trees were poor. These sites were found to be located along narrow strips of concave slopes or on large flat terraces. Further investigation showed that Vertisols in those physiographic locations were characterised by comparatively high moisture contents at field capacity and poor aeration in the root zone. These factors were found to be limiting mango production. Prior to planting mangoes on Vertisols, water infiltration rates and field capacities should be checked. The planting of mangoes on Vertisols located on lower parts of concave slopes or in wet sites on flat terraces should be avoided.
