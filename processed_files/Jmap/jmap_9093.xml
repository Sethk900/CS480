A Watershed Scale Assessment of Riparian Forests, with Implications for Restoration Abstract A combination of air-photo interpretation, field data, and\nGeographic Information System (GIS) analysis was used to map riparian\nareas that are likely to provide wood and shade to small- and medium-sized\nstreams and where, conversely, restoration might be most beneficial.\nThe analysis encompassed all salmonid-bearing waters of the Nooksack\nRiver basin, in northwest Washington State, plus small tributaries\nthat were thought to contribute wood or effective shading. The size\nand composition of each riparian stand was examined to determine\nwhether trees were large enough to contribute logs that would form\npools in the adjacent channel, with pool-forming size of wood a function\nof channel width. Riparian stands were classified according to whether\nthey passed this pool-forming test. Model results were an exact match\nto actual conditions in 69% of field-verified stands. A large proportion\n(74%) of the stands failing the test in reaches of anadromous fish\nuse were in agricultural areas. Passing stands typically had high\nshade levels, because both stream shade and effective large woody\ndebris size are a function of the size of the trees relative to the\nsize of the stream. The GIS layer of passing and failing riparian\nstands can be combined with layers depicting property ownership,\nthreatened fish distribution, and other information to objectively\nprioritize riparian restoration locations and strategies.
