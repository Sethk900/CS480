Ecological Interactions of Pieris brassicae L. (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) and Native Pierini in ChileAbstract Pieris brassicae, a Palaearctic pest introduced into Chile about 1970, coâ€occurs spatially and temporally with three native Pierini of the genus Tatochila. The habit of P. brassicae of laying eggs in large masses on large, succulent hosts effectively prevents competition for hosts with T. mercedis and T. blanchardii, both of which oviposit singly on small, slender Cruciferous hosts. The early stages of T. theodice are unknown, but it is apparently not a Crucifer feeder. P. brassicae appears to have filled a â€œvacant nicheâ€; created by the naturalization of robust, weedy European Crucifers in Chile.
