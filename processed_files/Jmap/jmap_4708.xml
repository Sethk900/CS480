Efficacy and phytotoxicity of simazine and terbuthylazine on lupinsA need exists for more effective control of broad leaf weeds in lupins (Lupinus albus L., L. angustifolius L. and L. luteus L.) in South Africa. In this study simazine and terbuthylazine which are used with success elsewhere, were evaluated on four lupin cultivars at two localities in the summer rainfall area. Single and double dosage rates of both compounds were compared to alachlor. Phytotoxicity and efficacy of weed control were evaluated weekly for two months after application. Lupin seed yield was determined. Residual effects of each of the herbicides on follow-up crops were evaluated during the following growing season, using wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), maize (Zea mays L.) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) as test crops. Both experimental herbicides provided effective control of a wide spectrum of weed species commonly occurring in the summer rainfall area. No symptoms of phytotoxicity to lupins were recorded at any locality or on any cultivar, and lupin seed production was not adversely affected. No residual effect was apparent on follow-up crops, even at double the registered dosage rates. The extension of the registration of these herbicides for the control of broad leaf weeds in lupin in the summer rainfall area is indicated.
