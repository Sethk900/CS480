Effects of addition of 12 metals on carbon dioxide release during incubation of an acid sandy soilSamples of a sandy soil (pH 4.9) were mixed with 10 and 100 p.p.m. of 12 metals (as sulphates) and incubated (30Â°C) aerobically for 2 and 8 weeks. Depression of CO2 release with 100 p.p.m. metal levels over 8 weeks increased in the order Bi, Cd, Co, Cu, Pb, Ni, Tl, Sb, Sn, Zn, Hg, Ag. Toxicity order differed somewhat with 10 p.p.m. metal levels and with incubation period.
