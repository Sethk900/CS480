Particulate organic matter, soil texture and mineralogy relations in some Eastern Cape ecotopes in South AfricaContrasting reports have been given on the relationships between soil texture, mineralogy and particulate organic matter (POM). The objective of this study was to determine the effects of soil texture and mineralogy on aggregate POM in several ecotopes in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Soil from the surface 0â€“20 cm was collected from 14 ecotopes. Particulate organic matter was fractionated into litter POM, coarse POM and fine POM. Isolation of the POM fraction was done by dispersing the soil in 5 g l-1 sodium hexametaphosphate and passing the dispersed soil samples through a 0.053 mm sieve. Both total soil organic matter (SOM) and the POM in each fraction were determined using the weight loss on ignition procedure. Most ecotopes were either sandy loam or sandy clay loam and primary minerals especially quartz dominated the soil mineralogy. The clay content was significantly related to the total SOM (r = 0.78), hematite (r = 0.83) and quartz (r = -0.74). The results suggest that in soils that are dominated by primary minerals such as quartz, the clay content, rather than the clay plus silt content, is a better indicator of fine POM and total SOM.
