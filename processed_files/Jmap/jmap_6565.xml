Economical alternatives for topogenous peat as casing material in the cultivation of Agaricus bisporus in South AfricaSphagnum peat moss is used in most countries as a casing material in the cultivation of Agaricus bisporus. Since South Africa has no peat moss, suitable substitutes for it have to be found. Nine potential materials were screened as casing media of which topogenous peat, paper pulp and spent compost gave encouraging results and were further investigated. Apart from mushroom production, various physical, chemical and microbiological properties of the substrates were compared. Weathered spent compost and topogenous peat gave the highest mushroom yields.
