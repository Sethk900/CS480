Cactiâ€“shrub interactions in the coastal desert of northern Sinaloa, MexicoSpatial patterns and replacement in ten cacti were studied on an island of the coastal desert of Sinaloa, Mexico. Four platyopuntias had 74-92% of their individuals beneath shrub canopies, whereas three globose cacti, one columnar cactus and two cylindropuntias had similar or higher percentages of individuals in open spaces. This study advances the idea that open-space colonization is enhanced by less harsh physical and biotic conditions in coastal deserts, and by certain morphological and physiological adaptations of cacti. The absence of nurse-shrub replacement is understood as a result of induced co-existence by physical damage from cyclones in the coastal zone. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
