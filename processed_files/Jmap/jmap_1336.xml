Restoration of a Forest Understory After the Removal of an Invasive Shrub, Amur Honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii).The recruitment of native seedlings is often reduced in areas where the invasive Amur honeysuckle (<em>Lonicera maackii</em>) is abundant. To address this recruitment problem, we evaluated the effectiveness of <em>L. maackii</em> eradication methods and restoration efforts using seedlings of six native tree species planted within eradication and unmanipulated (control) plots. Two eradication methods using glyphosate herbicide were evaluated: cut and paint and stem injection with an EZ-Ject lance. <em>Lonicera maackii</em> density and biomass as well as microenvironmental characteristics were measured to study their effects on seedling growth and survivorship. Mean biomass of Amur honeysuckle was 361 ± 69 kg/ha, and density was 21,380 ± 3,171 plants/ha. Both eradication treatments were effective in killing <em>L. maackii</em> (≥ 94%). The injection treatment was most effective on large <em>L. maackii</em> individuals (>1.5 cm diameter), was 43% faster to apply than cutting and painting and less fatiguing for the operator, decreased operator exposure to herbicide, and minimized impact to nontarget vegetation. Deer browse tree protectors were used on half of the seedlings, but did not affect survivorship or growth. After 3 years, survival of native seedlings was significantly less where <em>L. maackii</em> was left intact (32 ± 3%) compared with the eradication plots (<em>p</em> < 0.002). Seedling survival was significantly different between cut (51 ± 3%) and injected (45 ± 3%) plots. Species had different final percent survival and rates of mortality. Species survival differed greatly by species (in descending order): <em>Fraxinus pennsylvanica</em> > <em>Quercus muehlenbergii</em> ≥ <em>Prunus serotina</em>≥ <em>Juglans nigra</em> > <em>Cercis canadensis</em> > <em>Cornus florida</em>. Survivorship and growth of native seedlings was affected by a severe first-year drought and by site location. One site exhibited greater spring soil moisture, pH, percent open canopy, and had greater survivorship relative to the other site (55 ± 2 vs. 30 ± 2%). Overall, both <em>L. maackii</em> eradication methods were successful, but restorationists should be aware of the potential for differential survivorship of native seedlings depending on species identity and microenvironmental conditions.
