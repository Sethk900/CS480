A review of Solenysa spiders from Japan (Araneae, Linyphiidae), with a comment on the type species S. mellotteei Simon, 1894The present paper gives a review of Solenysa species from Japan and provides a solution for the species bearing the generotype name S. mellotteei Simon, 1894. A total of six species are recorded, including two new species S. macrodonta sp. n. and S. trunciformis sp. n. The species collected from Kawasaki (NSMT-Ar 11154) and Hachioji should be the generotype S. mellotteei, with S. akihisai Tu, 2011, syn. n. as its junior synonym. To distinguish these congeneric species from each other, their genital characters are provided in detail based on images collected by scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy.
