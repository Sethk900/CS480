Gall induction by an Australian insect of the family Thripidae (Thysanoptera: Terebrantia)Leafâ€fold galls induced by Cyrilthrips cecidis gen. nov. et sp. nov. on Austrosteenisia blackii (Fabaceae) in eastern Queensland, Australia, involve either single or double folds. Singleâ€fold galls are subject to invasion by two species of kleptoparasitic Phlaeothripidae, to which doubleâ€fold galls are largely immune. This thripid is a member of a southeast Asian lineage of Thripinae in which gallâ€induction is possibly recurrent. This lineage includes the genus Chaetanaphothrips in which some species are crop pests but not gallâ€inducing. Females of Cyrilthrips have a unique curved spur on the hind coxae, and the ocellar chaetotaxy is also unique among Thripidae.
