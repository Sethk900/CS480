A Mark–Recapture Technique for Monitoring Feral Swine Populations.Techniques to monitor populations of feral swine (<em>Sus scrofa</em>) relative to damage control activities are needed on rangelands. Our objectives were to describe and assess a mark-recapture technique using tetracycline hydrochloride (TH) for monitoring feral swine populations. We established bait stations at study sites in southern and central Texas. During 1 d, we replaced normal soured corn bait with bait containing TH and counted the number of feral swine that consumed bait with observers. We conducted feral swine removal using box-style traps and helicopters, at which time we collected teeth for TH analysis. In southern Texas, we estimated population reduction to be 43%. In central Texas, we estimated population reduction of 31%. Our mark-recapture population monitoring technique would complement programs to manage feral swine populations and damage through lethal control.
