Soils on erosional footslopes in two basins differing in relief in North Dakota, USASoils were compared in a pair of adjacent drainage basins in southwestern North Dakota. One basin (Davis Creek) has high relief due to post-Pleistocene rejuvenation of the master stream and consequent dissection. The other basin (Norwegian Creek) has low relief and is stable. Soils were examined on the lower, middle and upper portions of three erosional footslopes in the lower, middle and upper reaches of each basin. Pedons at three locations on one footslope in each of the lower, middle and upper reaches were sampled for laboratory analyses. Those included determining proportions of clay, ions in saturated paste, electrical conductivity and two sodium adsorption ratios, one determined in the usual way and the other corrected for ion activity and ion pairing. The nature and distribution of the soils in the two basins indicate that their genesis has been strongly affected by a combination of geomorphic histories, positions, and levels of salinity and Na+ in parent materials. Torriorthents and Ustochrepts are major soils in the basin with high relief (Davis Creek) but Natriborolls occupy the lowest parts of some erosional footslopes in the middle and upper reaches. Haploborolls are the major soils in the basin with low relief (Norwegian Creek) but Natriborolls are dominant in the upper reaches. The distinctions among the soils can be related to the stability of landscape positions and to levels of Na+ in underlying materials or in the soils themselves. Possible mechanisms for transfers and concentration of Na+ are suggested by the relative positions and kinds of soils on these footslopes.
