A historical review of the studies of Neotropical tiger beetles (Coleoptera: Cicindelidae) with special reference to their use in biodiversity and conservationThis review presents a detailed account and synthesis of studies of the family of tiger beetles (Cicindelidae) from the Neotropical region and their usefulness as a surrogate taxon. Information is included on their taxonomy, phylogeny, physiology, ecology, behavior and conservation. Using a model of historical development, this information is put into a context of what has been studied and what studies are most needed in the future to better understand, conserve and manage biodiversity in the Neotropics.
