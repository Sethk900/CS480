On the validity of Epeorella Ulmer, 1939 (Ephemeroptera, Heptageniidae) with general considerations on the Heptageniidae of the Sunda IslandsAbstract The type material of Epeorella borneonia Ulmer, 1939, the sole species of the genus Epeorella Ulmer, 1939 is reinvestigated and a lectotype (male imago) is designated. Based on several morphological structures, the synonymy with Epeorus Eaton, 1881 (Rhithrogeninae) is rejected. Epeorella stat. prop., known only at the winged stages, belongs to the subfamily Ecdyonurinae, and is a probable endemic of the island of Borneo. The newly erected genus Darthus Webb & McCafferty, 2007, also endemic to Borneo and only known by one species at the nymphal stage, is shown to be a junior subjective synonym of Epeorella. The new combination Epeorella vadora (Webb & McCafferty, 2007) is proposed for the species. The distribution of known heptageniid species from the Sunda Islands is discussed.
