Removal of Pilosocereus leucocephalus (Cactaceae, tribe Cereeae) seeds by ants and their potential role as primary seed dispersers.Myrmecochory sensu stricto is uncommon in Neotropical forests. In these ecosystems the role of ants as secondary dispersers of non-myrmecochorous seeds is well known, however, the primary dispersal of this type of seed by ants has been poorly documented. Only a few anecdotal observations scattered throughout the literature report the removal of these seeds from fruit on the plant by ants. We show experimentally that ants are able to remove more pulp and seeds from fruit on the branches than do flying vertebrates in Pilosocereus leucocephalus, a columnar cactus bearing typically ornithochorous fruit. In addition, experiments emulating seed cleaning revealed that cleaned seeds germinate earlier. These results suggest a possible role of ants as primary cactus dispersers; one that requires more extensive research on seed fate and seedling establishment success.
