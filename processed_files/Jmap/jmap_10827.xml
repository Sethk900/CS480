Developing a strategic plan for future hunting participation in TexasThis paper describes a 5-year planning process that addressed the decline of hunting participation in Texas. We began the planning process by examining 20 years of research that revealed a decline in hunting participation and factors contributing to the decline. We convened a Hunting Think Tank meeting where we presented the 20-year trend data to 30 individuals with vested interests in the future of hunting in Texas. One outcome of the first meeting was the development of a synthesis brochure, â€œThe Future of Hunting in Texas,â€ to educate the hunting public and stakeholders about current trends and future implications and build support for the need to develop a strategic plan. The Future of Hunting information and brochure were presented to the Hunting Advisory Board of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, after which the Board added development of a strategic plan to its agenda. In fact, the 2002 Governor's Hunting Heritage Symposium was delayed one year until a strategic plan was developed. Group Solutions was hired to survey the hunting and nonhunting public about the future of hunting in Texas. Its survey data were used to define content of the strategic plan during a 2-day meeting of 60 invited stakeholders before the annual conference of the Texas Wildlife Association. The strategic plan included, among other things, all issues and problems associated with the decline in hunting participation in Texas, an action plan to address the decline, and the requirements needed to activate the plan. Several other valuable outcomes derived from the planning process, beyond development of the Strategic Plan, were included in this report.
