Release of streak-resistant maize inbred linesThe streak disease-resistant Vaalharts maize composite was used as the non-recurrent parent in crosses with the USA inbred lines Mo17 and B73, and local elite breeding material, representative of the F and M heterotic groups, to develop resistant inbred lines with improved combining ability for yield. S3 lines were crossed to I137TN as tester. Compared with prominent commercial hybrids, a number of test crosses were identified with superior yield potential under streak conditions and comparative yields in the absence of the disease. Characterization data on 15 S5 lines, intended for release, are provided.
