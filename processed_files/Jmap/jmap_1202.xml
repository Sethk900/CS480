Spiders and Other Arthropods as Indicators in Old-Growth Versus Logged Redwood Stands.This study, conducted in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California, provides data on the abundance and diversity of litter spiders and other arthropods in three redwood forest conditions: old growth, second growth, and tree farm. Litter spiders are linked to and reflect habitat structure and prey abundance and can act as indicators for redwood forest restoration and monitoring. There were significant declines in spider and other arthropod diversity and abundance with increased logging and decreased herb cover. The absolute and relative increase in nocturnal spiders and detritivores in unlogged sites suggests that guild structures of spiders and other arthropods can indicate forest recovery from logging disturbance. Furthermore, selectively harvested stands do not retain old-growth levels of litter arthropod diversity or abundance. This study identifies potential indicator redwood litter spiders that show higher abundances in old-growth areas, <em>Zelotes</em> sp. (Gnaphosidae), <em>Xysticus</em> sp. (Thomisidae), and <em>Ceratinops inflata</em> (Linyphiidae) and a possible old-growth specialist, <em>Phrurotimpus</em> sp. (Liocranidae). These findings strengthen the case for including soil arthropods in redwood forest monitoring and assessment and for the preservation of undisturbed forest areas.
