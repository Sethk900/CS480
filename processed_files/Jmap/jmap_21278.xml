Cartographic analysis of woodlice fauna of the former USSRAbstract An inventory of the woodlice fauna of the former USSR yielded 190 species, 64 of them were recorded from the territory of Russia. According to the cartographic analysis, the limits of distribution of epigean terrestrial isopods over the area, excluding mountains, is explained by temperature. No woodlice records were found outside the isocline of 120 days a year with the mean daily air temperature >10Â°C. The highest species diversity was found between the isoclines of 180 and 210 days. These areas correspond to forest-steppe and steppe zones.
