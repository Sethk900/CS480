Spatial and temporal variability in forest-atmosphere CO2 exchange.Seven years of carbon dioxide flux measurements indicate that a &sim;90-year-old spruce dominated forest in Maine, USA, has been sequestering 174±46 g C m<sup>-;2</sup> yr<sup>-;1</sup> (mean±1 standard deviation, nocturnal friction velocity (<em>u</em><sub>*</sub>) threshold >0.25 m s<sup>-;1</sup>). An analysis of monthly flux anomalies showed that above-average spring and fall temperatures were significantly correlated with greater monthly C uptake while above-average summer temperatures were correlated with decreased net C uptake. Summer months with significantly drier or wetter soils than normal were also characterized by lower rates of C uptake. Years with above-average C storage were thus typically characterized by warmer than average spring and fall temperatures and adequate summer soil moisture.
