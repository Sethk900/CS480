Potential of halophytes as source of edible oilSeeds of Arthrocnemum indicum, Alhaji maurorum, Cressa cretica, Halopyrum mucronatum, Haloxylon stocksii and Suaeda fruticosa were analyzed to determine their potential to be used as source of edible oil. The quantity of oil present varied from 22% to 25%. The amounts of unsaturated fatty acids were high (65–74%) except in A. maurorum. The lipids in the seeds were found to contain 12 unsaturated fatty acids and four saturated fatty acids. The ash content also ranged from 2%–39%. Our data clearly indicate that the seeds of halophytes particularly S. fruticosa could be used as a source of oil for human consumption.
