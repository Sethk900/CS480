Two new species of Tynanthus Miers (Bignonieae, Bignoniaceae) from BrazilTynanthus is a genus of lianas that is broadly distributed through the Neotropics. Two new species of Tynanthus from Brazil are here described and illustrated: T. densiflorus, from Amazonas, and T. espiritosantensis, from Esp√≠rito Santo. T. densiflorus is recognized by the conspicuous interpetiolar glandular fields, a feature rarely found in Tynanthus, and the dense thyrses. Tynanthus espiritosantensis, on the other hand, is recognized by the bromeliad-like prophylls of the axillary buds and the lax thyrses. Information on the distribution, conservation status and morphologically similar species are provided.
