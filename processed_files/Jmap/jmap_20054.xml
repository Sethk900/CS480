A new three-band algorithm for estimating chlorophyll concentrations in turbid inland lakesA new three-band model was developed to estimate chlorophyll-a concentrations in turbid inland waters. This model makes a number of important improvements with respect to the three-band model commonly used, including lower restrictions on wavelength optimization and the use of coefficients which represent specific inherent optical properties. Results showed that the new model provides a significantly higher determination coefficient and lower root mean squared error (RMSE) with respect to the original model for upwelling data from Taihu Lake, China. The new model was tested using simulated data for the MERIS and GOCI satellite systems, showing high correlations with the former and poorer correlations with the latter, principally due to the lack of a 709 nm centered waveband. The new model provides numerous advantages, making it a suitable alternative for chlorophyll-a estimations in turbid and eutrophic waters.
