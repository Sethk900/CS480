Some improvements of the fractionation method of organic phosphorus in calcareous soilsSome improvements of the fractionation of organic phosphorus (P0) in calcareous soils were made on the basis of different soil extractants. Labile P0 contained in soil microorganisms was extracted by fumigation of soil with chloroform (CHCl3). The shaking time for extracting labile P0, moderately labile P0 and stable P0 was shortened to 20 min, 2 h and 2 h, respectively, by using ultrasonic treatment. For extracting soil stable P0 effectively, the concentration of NaOH was reexamined and 0.05 mol/l NaOH was proved to be suitable. According to the mineralization rate, stable P0 can be subdivided into moderately stable P0 and highly stable P0 by adjusting the alkali solution to pH 3.00 as the suitable acidity.
