Impacts of the local land-use system in a semi-arid region of northeastern China on soil properties, crop growth, and weed communities.We examined changes in soil properties, crop biomass, and weed communities in the Horqin Sandy Land of China to elucidate cropland degradation. We studied three local cropland types having periods of cultivation of up to 20 years: maize cropland on lowlands without irrigation (nonirrigated lowland), maize cropland on flat sandy lands with irrigation (irrigated flatland), and bean-centered cropland on sand dunes without irrigation (nonirrigated dunes). Soil properties and crop biomass were more degraded in nonirrigated lowland and nonirrigated dunes than in irrigated flatland. Weed communities in the nonirrigated croplands were the type that become established in drier conditions, whereas wetland weeds were more abundant on irrigated flatland. Trends of change in each indicator did not always occur in parallel and differed statistically among the cropland types. Monitoring these indicators within the context of local land-use systems can provide scientific evidence on which to base local management practices or recommendations for change.
