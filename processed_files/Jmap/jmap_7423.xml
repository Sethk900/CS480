On the presence of Trachipterus nigrifrons Smith, 1956, (Pisces, Lampridiformes) in the Western South Atlantic OceanA dealfish specimen 1200 + mm long, found on June 20,1966, on the seashore in the Central Patagonian town of Puerto Deseado (47°15' S, 65°55' W), Argentina, constitutes the first record of the family Trachipteridae in the Western South Atlantic. The specimen, deposited in the Museo de La Plata Ichthyological Collection under Register Number MLP 1.12.1977.1, was originally fixed in formalin solution, but because of its great length was left thereafter drying in a locker at the "Estacion de Biologfa Marina Puerto Deseado" where it deteriorated notably, with the loss of parts of the trunk and dorsal fin. The present state of the specimen prevented its morphometric measurement but its general body outline could be established, and important meristic counts and other observations could be performed, providing enough information for a specific diagnosis.
