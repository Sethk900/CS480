Soil respiration at five sites along the Kalahari Transect: Effects of temperature, precipitation pulses and biological soil crust coverThere are increasing concerns that climatic and land use changes will enhance soil respiration rates and soil organic carbon loss, compromising agricultural productivity and further elevating atmospheric CO(2). Current understanding of dryland respiration is, however, insufficient to enable prediction of the consequences of these changes for dryland soils and CO(2) fluxes. The objectives of this paper are to present in-situ respiration data from five remote sites along a climatic gradient in the Kalahari of Botswana and to determine the effects of temperature, moisture and biological crust cover on soil CO(2) fluxes. Moisture was the primary limiting factor to efflux which increased with amount of simulated rainfall. On dry soils, mean CO(2) efflux was between 1.5 and 5.9 mg C m(-2) h(-1). After 2 mm and 50 mm simulated wetting, mean rates increased to 4.0 to 21.8 and 8.6 to 41.5 mg C m(-2) h(-1) respectively. Once wet, soil CO(2) efflux increases with temperature, and sites at the hotter northern end of the transect lost more CO(2) than cooler southerly sites. Net respiration rates are, however, muted by autotrophic organisms in biological soil crusts which photosynthesise and take up CO(2). The temperature sensitivity of soil CO(2) efflux increased with moisture. Dry, 2 mm and 50 mm treated soils had a Q(10) of 1.1, 1.5 and 1.95 respectively. Our findings indicate that higher temperatures and a loss of biological crust cover will lead to greater soil C loss through respiration. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
