Mimetic and Nonâ€Mimetic Populations of Eleutherodactylus gaigeae (Dunn) in lower Central America and Colombia (Amphibia: Anura, Leptodactylidae)Eleutherodactylus gaigeae populations, in the valleys of the Rio Cauca, Rio Magdalena, and Rio Sinu, are drab colored frogs whereas transâ€Andean and Central American populations are black with yellow, orange, or gold dorsolateral stripes. Some transâ€Andean populations are syntopic with similarly patterned poisonâ€dart frogs (Phyllobates) but most populations retain the mimetic color pattern in spite of the absence of the toxic models.
