Revision of the genus Acryptolaria Norman, 1875 (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa, Lafoeidae)The genus Acryptolaria is reviewed, with a complete redescription of the type specimens, with the exception of A. andersoni and A. rectangularis for which type material could not be located. The genus includes 16 valid species, though A. andersoni is insufficiently known. All records found in the literature have been checked. The cnidome proved to be a useful tool for species identification. A key for the identification of the species of the genus is also presented.
