Eurytion heurtaultae sp. n. from Argentina and Uruguay with notes on E. tenebrosus and E. yungarum and a key to the Neotropical taxa of the genus (Chilopoda: Geophilomorpha: Geophilidae)Eurytion heurtaultae sp. n. (Chilopoda: Geophilomorpha: Geophilidae) is described from the Provinces of Santa Fe, CÃ³rdoba and Buenos Aires (Argentina) and Department of Lavalleja (Uruguay). The new species seems to be closely related to Eurytion tenebrosus (Meinert, 1886) from the Province of Formosa (Argentina) and Department of Treinta y Tres (Uruguay). Additional data for Eurytion tenebrosus complementing Meinert's (1886) original description and the description by Crabill (1968) are provided based on a re-examination of the type specimens. Additional details of intraspecific variation are also given. The female of Eurytion yungarum Pereira, 2005 is described from an additional specimen, from Parque Nacional Calilegua, Province of Jujuy, Argentina, which is a new locality for the geographical distribution of the species. A key to the Neotropical species of the genus is also included.
