Summer diets of feral hogs in the Davis Mountains, TexasAlthough feral hogs (Sus scrofa) have expanded their range into the Chihuahuan Desert, of Texas, little information is available on their ecology We determined that the summer diet of feral hogs (n = 28) in the Davis Mountains of Texas was dominated by herbaceous material (38.6%) and roots and tubers (34.3%). Further investigation is needed to determine the impact of feral hog foraging behavior on the fragile floral and faunal communities of the Chihuahuan Desert.
