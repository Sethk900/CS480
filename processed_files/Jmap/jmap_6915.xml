Stomach Content of Juvenile and Adult Piranhas (Serrasalmus marginatus) in the Paran√° Floodplains, BrazilThe piranha, Serrasalmus marginatus is an abundant fish in the floodplains of the upper Paran√°√ river. We studied the stomach content of juvenile and adult piranhas over a year and determined the food items. Fragments of fish were the main diet components with age-dependent differences. There was no seasonal variation in the prey. This piranha is basically a diurnal predator with some differences in daily periods of feeding activity between juveniles and adults.
