Estimation of global warming potential from upland cropping systems in central Hokkaido, JapanSeven upland cropping systems in Central Hokkaido, Japan, were investigated during the growing season in 2003 to evaluate the magnitude of N2O emission, CH, uptake and soil carbon sequestration, and their net effect on the global warming potential (GWP). N2O and CH, fluxes were measured from field soils planted with crops and CO2 fluxes were measured from bare soils in attached plots at each site using the closed chamber method. Cumulative N2O emissions ranged from 0.02 g N m(-2) to 0.62 g N m(-2) for different soil types, which accounted for 0.35-4.44% of the applied fertilizer nitrogen. Cumulative CH, uptake rates ranged from -0.08 g C m(-2) to 0 g C m(-2). Soil carbon sequestration, defined as the difference between the net primary production and carbon loss through harvest and soil microbial decomposition, ranged from -410 to -193 g C m(-2), indicating that the carbon loss from soils could not be compensated by the carbon input through plant photosynthesis. The net GWP from the investigated cropping systems ranged from 749 to 1790 g CO2 equivalents m(-2). CO2 emission contributed to 84-99% of the net GWP and N2O contributed 1-16%.
