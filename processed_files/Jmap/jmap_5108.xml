Systematics and ecology of the caecilian Crotaphatrema lamottei (Nussbaum) (Amphibia: Gymnophiona: Scolecomorphidae)New observations on Crotaphatrema lamottei are reported based on fieldwork on Mount Oku between 2006 and 2008. This species was encountered by pitfall trapping and digging, but encounter rates were low. Six new specimens of C. lamottei add substantially to the previous hypodigm for the species and genus, and new morphometric and meristic data are presented. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequence data supports strongly the monophyly of Crotaphatrema. The genetic and morphological distance between C. lamottei and Crotaphatrema tchabalmbaboensis is small, although there is a clear difference in colour pattern. The Data Deficient IUCN conservation status of all three species of Crotaphatrema is likely to change most readily as a result of better data on distribution.
