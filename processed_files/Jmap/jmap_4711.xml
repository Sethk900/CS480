CLIMGEN-UP: A user-friendly weather data generatorUser-friendly Windows software, CLIMGEN-UP, was developed based on the CLIMGEN weather data generator. CLIMGEN-UP calculates and stores monthly statistical parameters, based on historic data of daily rainfall, minimum and maximum temperature. It can then generate and store long-series of daily rainfall, minimum and maximum temperature, based on the monthly statistical parameters. Historic and generated data can be displayed graphically. CLIMGEN-UP is written in Delphi v. 5.0 and makes use of a Paradox database. The program is available for use with Windows 98/ME/2000 and NT on an IBM-PC or compatible computer, and is supplied as executable code on 3.5â€³ disk. Possible applications are in hydrology, environmental and ecosystem management as well as agricultural risk assessment where long-term simulations of system behaviour are required.
