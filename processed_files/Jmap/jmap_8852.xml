Neolithic tombs in southwestern SinaiIn the southern part of the plain of El Qa' there is a group of previously unknown tombs, probably dating to within 500â€“600 years of 7000 BP. They are adjacent to a freshwater playa, and east of the first access to the Gulf of Suez south of Gebel Qabiliat. This paper describes the largest of the tombs, which was quite elaborate and included prestige grave-goods (turquoise).
