Soil surface CO2 flux in a boreal black spruce fire chronosequenceUnderstanding the effects of wildfire on the carbon (C) cycle of boreal forests is essential to quantifying the role of boreal forests in the global carbon cycle. Soil surface CO2 flux (R-s), the second largest C flux in boreal forests, is directly and indirectly affected by fire and is hypothesized to change during forest succession following fire. The overall objective of this study was to measure and model R-s for a black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] BSP) postfire chronosequence in northern Manitoba, Canada. The experiment design was a nested factorial that included two soil drainage classes (well and poorly drained) seven postfire aged stands. Specific objectives were (1) to quantify the relationship between R-s and soil temperature for different aged boreal black spruce forests in well-drained and poorly drained soil conditions, (2) to examine R-s dynamics along postfire successional stands, and (3) to estimate annual soil surface CO2 flux for these ecosystems. Soil surface CO2 flux was significantly affected by soil drainage class (p=0.014) and stand age (p=0.006). Soil surface CO2 flux was positively correlated to soil temperature (R-2=0.78, p<0.001), but different models were required for each drainage class aged stand combination. Soil surface CO2 flux was significantly greater at the well-drained than the poorly drained stands (p=0.007) during growing season. Annual soil surface CO2 flux for the 1998, 1995, 1989, 1981, 1964, 1930, and 1870 burned stands averaged 226, 412, 357, 413, 350, 274, and 244 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in the well-drained stands and 146, 380, 300, 303, 256, 233, and 264 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in the poorly drained stands. Soil surface CO2 flux during the winter (from 1 November to 30 April) comprised from 5 to 19% of the total annual R-s. We speculate that the smaller soil surface CO2 flux in the recently burned than the older stands is mainly caused by decreased root respiration.
