Platygonus sp. (Mammalia: Tayassuidae) in Uruguay (Raigón? Formation; Pliocene–early Pleistocene), comments about its distribution and palaeoenvironmental significance in South AmericaThis study provides the first record of Platygonus in Uruguay (Raigón? Formation, Pliocene–early Pleistocene; Canelones Department). The allocation to the Raigón Formation is tentative because the remains were found in a drill core. It is the oldest record of a tayassuid in Uruguay. The following morphological features clearly indicate that it belongs to Platygonus: simple premolars that are bicuspid, bunolophodont, mesodont and with an enamel cingulum surrounding the entire tooth. This is one of the largest forms among North American and South American Platygonus. The record of Platygonus in the Raigón Formation suggests arid or semi-arid climates, and, as do some associated birds and mammals, open or relatively open environments. A significant level of specific diversity of Platygonus in South America is recognized during the late Pliocene with the lowest diversity occurring during the early–middle Pleistocene.
