Nature and importance of subterranean insect damage to pre-harvest groundnutsThe nature and importance of insect damage to subterranean pre-harvest groundnuts were determined by regular sampling in commercial groundnut fields. Five categories of damage are described, viz. damage to newly planted seed, pegs, immature pods, mature pods and kernels. Both yield and quality were adversely affected by damage to immature pods, mature pods and kernels, but not necessarily by damage to seeds and pegs. Pod scarification, an aspect of damage to mature pods, was the most frequent type of injury observed. Insect numbers 110 days after planting had the most pronounced effect on damage to mature pods, with the Tenebrionidae insect group proving to be the most abundant.
