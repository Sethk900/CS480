Parasite fauna of the grey mullet Mugil cephalus L. 1758, and its relationship with some ecological factors in Lower Kızılırmak Delta located by the Black Sea, TurkeyParasites of the grey mullet Mugil cephalus collected from Lower Kızılırmak Delta in Turkey were investigated. Trichodina puytoraci, Trichodina lepsii, Ligophorus mediterraneus, Ligophorus cephali, Gyrodactylus sp., Microcotyle mugilis, Ascocotyle (Phagicola) longa, Haplosplanchnus pachysomus, Diplostomum spathaceum, Tylodelphys clavata, Posthodiplostomum sp., Neoechinorhyncus agilis and Ergasilus lizae were identified. Overall infection prevalence (%), mean intensity and mean abundance values were 99.61%, 458.10 ± 75.72 and 456.30 ± 75.44, respectively. Infection indices of parasite species in relation to season, lakes/lagoons and some physicochemical parameters of water such as temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and nitrate are determined and discussed. Posthodiplostomum sp. is a new parasite record for mugilids and Diplostomum spathaceum is the first record in M. cephalus, in the present study. Moreover, Ligophorus mediterraneus, Ligophorus cephali and Ergasilus lizae are new records for Turkish parasite fauna of fish and Mugil cephalus is a new host record for Neoechinorhyncus agilis in Turkey.
