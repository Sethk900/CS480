A revised key to the Neotropical cleptoparasitic anthidiine genera (Hymenoptera, Megachilinae) with notes and description of the male of  Rhynostelis Moure & UrbanAbstract Rhynostelis Moure & Urban is a monotypic cleptoparasitic neotropical anthidiine genus currently known from two females. Herein, we describe and illustrate for the first time the male and its genitalia and it is confirmed that Rhynostelis parasitizes nests of Eufriesea. An identification key to the genera of cleptoparasitic anthidiine from the Neotropical region is also presented.
