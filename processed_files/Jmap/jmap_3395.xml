Distribution and status of sage grouse in ColoradoSage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) historically occurred in at least 23 and probably 27 counties within Colorado. Historic populations were largest in northern Colorado where sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) rangelands were most widespread. Currently, sage grouse occur in 15 counties in Colorado and are considered secure in only 5 counties. The long-term downward trend in sage grouse distribution and abundance in Colorado is related to loss of sagebrush-dominated rangelands and alteration and degradation of remaining sagebrush ecosystems. Management experiments are urgently needed to understand the importance of residual herbaceous cover to nest success and early brood survival. and to assess size and type of areas necessary to maintain viable populations of sage grouse.
