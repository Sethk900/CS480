Influence of abscisic acid on polyphenol oxidase browning potential in avocadoVarious levels of abscisic acid (ABA) were infused into unripened ‘Fuerte’ avocado fruit. After ripening, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity was measured, and abscisic acid (ABA) levels monitored. The study showed that an increase in applied ABA increased PPO levels, particularly in late- harvested fruit, indicating that ABA may play a vital role in determining post-harvest quality in avocados.
