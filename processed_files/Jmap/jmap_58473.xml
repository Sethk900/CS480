Numerical Modeling Study of Hydraulic Impact of a Large Sediment Capping FacilityAbstractAn engineered containment facility (ECF) that would cap and contain some of the most contaminated sediments in Hamilton Harbour has been proposed. Because of the size and shape of this structure, the ECF will alter local flow hydraulic conditions and isolate local discharges and intakes from free interaction with the open water of the harbour. To investigate the impact and functionality of the ECF, a three-dimensional (3D) hydraulic model was adopted in this study. The model was verified against vertical velocity profiles measured with an acoustic doppler current profiler in the study region. Results of the verification reveal that under the driving force of wind, the best agreement between simulated and measured currents occurs in the surface layer. Considering the complex nature of the hydraulic conditions in the harbour, the model performs reasonably well. Overall, the model should provide a useful tool considering and comparing hydraulic conditions under different ECF configurations and the existing condition. The functionality of a newly created connection channel used for the purpose of improving local water quality was studied in detail with some unexpected discoveries.
