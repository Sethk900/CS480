Unexpected ecotone dynamics of a sand dune vegetation complex following water table declineAims Central Hungarian inland dune ranges harbor heterogeneous grassland vegetation with an extensive network of ecotones, arranged perpendicular to topography-driven hydrologic gradients. The area suffers from severe aridification due to climate change and local anthropogenic factors, which have led to a dramatic decline of the water table. As a result, groundwater is no longer reachable for low-lying plant communities; thus, we expect they are bound to undergo profound changes. This study investigates how the plant communities respond to this changing environment over time by monitoring ecotones, since they are frequently the hotspots of ecosystem change. We monitored five ecotones along permanent belt transects for 15 years to characterize their dynamic response, and to identify the internal structural changes of the plant communities the ecotones delimit.
