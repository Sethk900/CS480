The squares were determined by draw. The homogenized ground samples of distinct points of the 39 squares, were colected in plastic flasks and analysed by the methods of fluctuation in sodium chloride saturated solution and magnesium sulphate saturated solution which contained 5% of potassium iodate. Both methods were executed twice for each sample. The results showed that the ground of 9 squares (23.07%) was contaminated, 6 of which were located near downtown. The execution of more than one laboratorial method permited the agent's identification in a grater percentage of squares.
