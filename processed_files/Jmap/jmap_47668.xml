Predatory insects in lentic freshwater habitats from northwest Patagonia: richness and phenologyThe main purpose of this work was to study the richness, phenology and abundance of predatory insects throughout the hydroperiod and how they relate to the environmental parameters in lentic bodies of water in northwest Patagonia. Nineteen fishless wetlands and three wetlands with fish were studied, which are located in the surroundings of the Nahuel Huapi National Park. Biotic and abiotic variables were measured during the hydroperiod of each wetland. The dip-netting sampling technique was used to determine the richness of predatory insects and to study the phenology of the dominant species in four wetlands. Species richness in temporary wetlands ranged from one to nine species per wetland and does not differ from that observed in the permanent environments with or without fish predators. Maximum insect richness was recorded in late spring and was associated with the maximum depth of the wetland and its structural complexity as well as with the duration of the hydroperiod.
