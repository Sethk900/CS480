Intercropping of beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and sugar-cane: The effect of inter-specific competition on the growth of plant caneThe competitive effects of intercropped beans (maturation period: three months) on the growth, tiller development and yield of plant sugar-cane (maturation period: 18 months) in the subhumid coast-hinterland of Natal were investigated over two seasons. In the first season rainfall was exceptionally low and intercropping reduced tiller emergence, leaf area and dry matter production in the sugar-cane. Lower soil and leaf water potentials were measured in the intercropped treatments. Beans appeared to be the stronger competitor and produced yields of up to 940 kg ha−1. Second season rainfall was favourable and tiller emergence was more prolific in the intercropping treatments. This combined with a higher degree of tiller mortality in the monoculture in the preceding autumn and winter, compensated for reduced dry matter production in the intercropped treatments in the first summer. As a result there was no difference between treatments in the final yield of cane and sucrose. Availability of soil moisture was the major factor affecting plant response to intercropping. S. Air. J.
