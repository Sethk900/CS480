Snow cover basal ice layer changes over Northern Eurasia since 1966An analysis is made of changes in basal ice crust layer characteristics from snow cover surveys made at 958 Russian stations since 1966. The analysis revealed that substantial changes have occurred in response to two competing processes: an increase in thaws associated with strong regional warming and an increase in the duration of the basal ice layer presence on the ground, and a shortening of the snowmelt period associated with a decrease in basal ice layer event frequency and severity. The latter appears to be the more significant process over the past 40 years. Our findings support the notion that the entire spring snowmelt process has become shorter in duration and more intense when taking into account a concomitant trend toward increasing snow depths over large regions of Russia. A more intense spring melt period has important consequences for spring flood dynamics and deserves further study.
