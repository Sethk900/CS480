Deriving Floodplain Topography and Vegetation Characteristics for Hydraulic Engineering Applications by Means of Terrestrial Laser ScanningAbstractThe purpose of this study was to explore the applicability of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) in determining floodplain ground level and vegetation properties for hydraulic analyses. The field investigations were conducted in a two-stage channel containing five differently vegetated test reaches established to represent conditions from bare soil to grasses and ∼1  m tall willows. Comparing TLS to manual cross-sectional and vegetation surveys brought new insight into the reliability of TLS as a method to determine the vegetation characteristics and floodplain ground level for different seasons and variable vegetation cover. The detected ground level had a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2–14 cm in the grassy test reaches with 50 cm window size. In spring the reach-averaged MAE was 4 cm and increased to 8 cm for the late growing season. For the densely vegetated test reaches, increasing the point cloud density from 50,000  pts/m2 did not considerably improve the ground-level estimate. For deriving spatial information about physically based vegetation characteristics such as the height distribution and the volumetric blockage factor, a digital surface model of 1 cm in resolution appeared suitable.
