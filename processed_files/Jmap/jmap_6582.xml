Barley cultivar identification by acid Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of hordein proteinsMethods are described for the extraction and separation of hordein proteins of barley by acid Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a means of identifying different cultivars. Experimental conditions for the extraction of the proteins from single kernels and from corresponding flour samples are described as well as the use of different solvents for extracting the hordein proteins. An electrophoretic formula was prepared for each cultivar using relative band mobility and staining intensity of protein bands. The resulting band patterns were used to identify different cultivars. Single kernels and flour samples gave identical band patterns but the intensity of bands of kernels was generally more pronounced.
