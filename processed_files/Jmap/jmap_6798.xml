Screening for DIMBOA (benzoxazinone) concentration among South African inbred maize lines and sorghum cultivarsTwenty-seven popular South African inbred maize lines, four commercial maize cultivars, two sweet corn cultivars and two grain sorghum cultivars were screened by means of a rapid, semi-quantitative method to determine DIMBOA concentration. Significant differences were found between inbred lines. Sweet corn cultivars exhibited a relatively high concentration of DIMBOA, while grain sorghum contained a very low concentration. Although differences in concentration between plants cultivated from different seed sizes were found, no definite trend could be established. S. Air. J. Plant Soil 1984, 1: 99â€“102
