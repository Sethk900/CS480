Analytical Load Rating of an Open-Spandrel Arch Bridge: Case StudyThe live load structural capacity of open-spandrel arch bridge structures is difficult to quantify. In addition to live and dead loads, geometric nonlinear effects, temperature effects, and material behavior play key roles in the design and load rating of such a structure. This paper is a case study that illustrates the effect these variables have on load rating a two-span shallow concrete arch bridge. Presented are load ratings of the structureâ€™s arch ribs using a three-dimensional finite-element model with American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials publications. As a result of this study, a refined analysis is recommended for load rating arch bridges.
