Stem wood properties of mature Norway spruce after 3 years of continuous exposure to elevated [CO2] and temperature.The objective of the study was to investigate the interactive effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, [CO<sub>2</sub>], and temperature on the wood properties of mature field-grown Norway spruce (<em>Picea abies</em> (L.) Karst.) trees. Material for the study was obtained from an experiment in Flakaliden, northern Sweden, where trees were grown for 3 years in whole-tree chambers at ambient (365 &mu;mol mol<sup>-;1</sup>) or elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] (700 &mu;mol mol<sup>-;1</sup>) and ambient or elevated air temperature (ambient +5.6 °C in winter and ambient +2.8 °C in summer). Elevated temperature affected both wood chemical composition and structure, but had no effect on stem radial growth. Elevated temperature decreased the concentrations of acetone-soluble extractives and soluble sugars, while mean and earlywood (EW) cell wall thickness and wood density were increased. Elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] had no effect on stem wood chemistry or radial growth. In wood structure, elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] decreased EW cell wall thickness and increased tracheid radial diameter in latewood (LW). Some significant interactions between elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] and temperature were found in the anatomical and physical properties of stem wood (e.g. microfibril angle, and LW cell wall thickness and density). Our results show that the wood material properties of mature Norway spruce were altered under exposure to elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] and temperature, although stem radial growth was not affected by the treatments.
