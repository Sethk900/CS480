A new damsel-dragonfly from the Mesozoic of China with a hook-like male anal angle (Odonata: Isophlebioptera: Campterophlebiidae)A new genus and species of campterophlebiid dragonfly, Angustiphlebia mirabilis gen. nov. et sp. nov., is described from the Jiulongshan Formation in China. It has some remarkable venational structures, i.e. a hypertrophy of the male hind wing anal angle, a quite long gaff, and a secondary branch of the anal anterior near subdiscoidal cell in hind wing, supporting the hypothesis of a sister-group relationship with the genus Oreophlebia. These new data will help to solve the phylogenetic relationships within the Campterophlebiidae. http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:16E602E6-3567-44D7-BF64-95A6597E55DE
