Rates of urea hydrolysis in five soils of indiaMost of the urea added to soil samples was hydrolysed within 24 h. The rate of hydrolysis was faster at 40% of water-holding capacity than at 60%, and was slower in soil samples with higher organic matter contents or electrical conductivity. The amounts of urea applied also influenced hydrolysis. The time required for urea hydrolysis increased with increase in the amount of urea applied but not in the same proportion. Hydrolysis was found to follow a first-order reaction.
