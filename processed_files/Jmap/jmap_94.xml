Comparative plant responses of Puccinellia distans and Puccinellia nuttalliana to sodic versus normal soil types.In the Grande Ronde Valley of eastern Oregon, two perennial grass species within the genus Puccinellia; Puccinellia distans (L.) Parl. (weeping alkaligrass) and Puccinellia nuttalliana Hitchc. (Nuttall's alkaligrass), are weeds that occupy distinct sodic soil patches within agriculturally productive fields. These two species were studied to determine if, under non-competitive conditions, either species exhibited attributes that could allow for the movement of populations into productive soils.
