Early stages of soil formation on glacial till mine spoils in a semi-arid climateStrip-mining and the construction of spoil banks composed of unweathered, clay loam textured, moderately calcareous glacial till has provided a model system for studying soil formation in the semi-arid grasslands of southern Saskatchewan. Revegetation of fresh spoils probably occurred within a year or two and includes many native and introduced grasses and herbs. On spoil banks 28–40 years old soluble salts, particularly sodium salts, had leached to considerable depth. Greater soluble cation contents in the surface horizons, as compared to 2.5–5 or 5–10-cm layers, indicated a cycling of these nutrients by vegetation. Nitrogen has accumulated at a rate of 2.43 ± 0.12 g/m2/yr, organic carbon at a rate of 28.2 ± 4 g/m2/yr, suggesting that organic-matter levels characteristic of regional soils could be accumulated in 250–350 years. Cation-exchange capacities increased with the accumulation of organic matter. The fractional composition and spectral properties of humic acids indicated that the humus of soils 28 years old was similar to that of the normal, regional soils. Carbonate weathering appears to be quite slow in grassland environments.
