Forb Nutrient Density for Sage Grouse Broods in Mountain Big Sagebrush Communities, MontanaSage grouse and grazing livestock numbers have both decreased dramatically over the last half of the 20th century. Forb density is critical for preincubating sage grouse hens and survival of young broods. Although sagebrush is needed for sage grouse cover and winter feed, recommended canopy cover levels may be too high to create a forb-rich herbaceous understory. Higher forb nutrient density for breeding hens and young broods could be achieved with targeted cattle grazing and selective thinning of mature mountain big sagebrush stands.
