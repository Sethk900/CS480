Echolocation of the big red bat Lasiurus egregius (Chiroptera: Vespertilionidae) and first record from the Central Brazilian AmazonLasiurus egregius (Peters, 1870) is a rare Neotropical vespertilionid bat and virtually no data on its ecology and echolocation calls are currently available. We report the capture of four individuals in the Central Amazon, representing the first record for the region and a significant (> 800 km) expansion of the species’ known range. Echolocation calls, recorded for the first time under natural conditions, were 1.5–8 ms in duration, and characterized by high mean bandwidth (18 kHz) and a mean frequency of maximum energy of 30 kHz.
