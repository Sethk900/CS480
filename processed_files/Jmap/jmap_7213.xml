The larval development of Palaemonid shrimps from the Amazon region reared in the laboratory. III. Extremely abbreviated development of Palaemonetes (Palaemonetes) mercedae Pereira, 1986 (Crustacea, Decapoda)The extremely abbreviated larval development of the small palaemonid shrimp Palaemonetes (Palaemonetes) mercedae Pereira, 1986 is described. Three ovigerous females, collected in a Central Amazonian blackwater forest creek, released their larvae in the laboratory. This species bears few (08, 11), large (2.01 Ã— 1.13 mm), yolkâ€rich eggs and hatches as a very advanced larva, which attains the juvenile phase after five days, at the first molt. The only significant nonâ€adult features are: the lack of spines on the carapace, the mouth parts without setae, the pleopods bearing no appendices interna, the absence of free uropods, and the broadly rounded, highly setaceous telson. Some characteristics of the larva and first juvenile stage are described and illustrated. These characteristics are compared with those presented by the other direct developers of the family Palaemonidae.
