Seasonal patterns in community composition of bats in forest fragments of the Alto Rio Paraná, southern BrazilWe studied seasonal patterns in richness and abundance in bat communities in Atlantic Forest fragments along the Paraná River in Brazil. There were differences in species composition among fragments but these appear more related to habitat quality than to fragment size. All fragments had high rates of captures of generalist frugivores and a scarcity of species known to be susceptible to disturbance. Richness and abundance were slightly lower during the dry season, but differences were significant only in the most degraded fragment.
