Long term effects of a brown coal-based amendment on the properties of soil humic acidsIn this study a typical grey-brown podzolic soil was amended with different doses of a brown coal-based preparation called Rekulter (R) largely used in Poland. After seven years, soils were analyzed and humic acids (HAs) were extracted both from the control soil and from the amended soils. All HAs were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy both in emission, excitation and synchronous-scan mode and as Excitationâ€“Emission-Matrix (EEM) contour maps. A higher carbon content was observed in the amended soils whereas significant differences were highlighted between the unamended and the amended soil HAs. HAs from amended soils showed a higher content of carboxyl groups and a more aromatic character, particularly HA extracted from the soil amended with the highest dose of R.
