Two new species of Zyzzogeton Breddin and the female of Z. haenschi Breddin (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae: Cicadellinae: Proconiini)Two new species of the leafhopper genus Zyzzogeton Breddin are described and illustrated: Z. emmrichi sp. nov. from Colombia and Z. guatemalensis sp. nov. from Guatemala. The two new taxa can be distinguished from the three other known species of the genus by their colour patterns and by the form of the apical processes of the aedeagus. A key to the species of Zyzzogeton is provided. The genus is newly recorded from Guatemala, which is its northernmost known record. Taxonomic and morphological data on Zyzzogeton and its species are added, including the first description of the female genitalia in the genus (Z. haenschi Breddin).
