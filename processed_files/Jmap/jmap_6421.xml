Bagworms (Lepidoptera: Psychidae): potential pests of guayule (Parthenium argentatum Gray) plantations in southern AfricaLarvae of the bagworm Eumeta hardenbergi (Bourgogne) (Lepidoptera: Psychidae) are reported for the first time to feed on the leaves and bark of guayule (Parthenium argentatum Gray) plants which were being examined as a potential source of natural rubber in Pietermaritzburg, Natal, South Africa. Plant damage due to the removal of stem shoots for bag construction by a light infestation of larvae was assessed. Subsequent losses in rubber yield were estimated to be c. 100 kg haâˆ’1. An unidentified bagworm was also found feeding on guayule leaves. Both species of bagworm should be considered as potential pests of guayule plantations in areas of southern Africa.
