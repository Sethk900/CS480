Wing Scale Covering Supports Close Relationship between Callipielus and Dalaca, Austral South American Ghost Moths (Lepidoptera: Hepialidae)Most Hepialidae have a single-layer wing covering of hollow scales. In the South American genera Callipielus and Dalaca, however, a very characteristic ‘type-2’ bilayer wing scale covering is present. As only Callipielus and Dalaca among 28 investigated hepialid genera have this type of wing scale covering, the two genera may be considered sister taxa.
