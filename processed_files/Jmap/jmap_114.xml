Marmot disturbances in a Mongolian steppe vegetation.We conducted a study in Mongolia on the Stipa steppe, which is the main habitat for the Siberian marmot (Marmota sibirica). The marmots create mounds that differ greatly in vegetation cover. Three types of mounds were distinguished, depending on the species dominating the vegetation on the mounds: an Artemisia type of mound, Leymus type and a Stipa type. It is hypothesized that the three types of mound represent a series of succession.
