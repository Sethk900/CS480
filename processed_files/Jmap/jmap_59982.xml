Nonparametric Modeling of Vehicle-Type-Specific Headway Distribution in Freeway Work ZonesAbstractThis paper presents a vehicle-type-specific headway distribution analysis in a freeway work zone. The goal of this paper is to provide a vehicle-type-specific model with different time periods using empirical work-zone data from highway I-91 in Greenfield, MA. A nonparametric approach with a Gaussian kernel is used to describe the vehicle-type-specific headway distribution in a freeway work zone. No assumption is required on how the headways should be distributed for nonparametric methods. The vehicles are classified into Car, Van, and Truck based on a FHWA vehicle-type classification scheme. Statistical tests indicate nonparametric distribution with Gaussian kernel outperforms the lognormal distribution in statistical sense according to the χ2 values. Further, another work zone dataset from Jacksonville, FL is utilized to examine the mixed headway scenario without specifying vehicle types. The K−S and Chi-square test results suggest the necessity of considering the vehicle types separately. Following the results, a discussion regarding why nonparametric model is better and the future research directions are presented.
