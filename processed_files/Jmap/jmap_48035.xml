Comparative larval morphology of the European bone-skippers, Thyreophora cynophila (Panzer, 1798) and Centrophlebomyia furcata (Fabricius, 1794) (Diptera: Piophilidae), with notes on their coexistence and natural historyConsidered at times as extinct, the European bone-skippers Thyreophora cynophila and Centrophlebomyia furcata (Diptera: Piophilidae) have been recently rediscovered in Spain, coexisting in some areas. Nevertheless, apart from their typical association with big mammal carcasses, little is known about them and the other species of subtribe Thyreophorina. In the present paper, the larval morphology of T. cynophila is described for the first time and compared with that of C. furcata. The morphology of cephalopharyngeal skeleton, the number and arrangement of the spines of ventral creeping welts, and the morphology and presence or absence of tubercles in the two last segments of the body, are the main characters allowing for larval identification of both species. Some preliminary field and laboratory observations on the behaviour and life cycle of the two species are also provided.
