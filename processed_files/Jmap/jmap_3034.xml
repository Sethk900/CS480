Reduced rodent biodiversity destabilizes plant populationsWe tested the hypothesis that species loss at one trophic level will reduce the temporal stability of populations at other trophic levels. We examined the temporal stability of annual plant populations on plots that experimentally manipulated the functional diversity of seed-eating rodent consumers. Experimental reduction of rodent functional diversity destabilized populations of small-seeded plants but had less consistent effects on larger-seeded species. Small-seeded species also exhibited a greater number of years of zero abundance. Thus, experimental reduction of rodent functional diversity resulted in lower plant diversity. The decline in the temporal stability of small-seeded plants likely resulted from increased interspecific competition by large-seeded plants. These results demonstrate that the loss of species at one trophic level can lead to reduced richness at lower trophic levels via competition and reduced temporal stability.
