Three New Species of Curtara (Homoptera: Cicadellidae: Gyponinae) from BrazilThree new species of the leafhopper genus Curtara DeLong & Freytag, 1972, C. mejdalanii spec. nov., C. maricaensis spec. nov., and C. restingalis spec. nov., are described from Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. They belong to the Notanda group of the subgenus Curtara because of the presence of only two subapical processes in the aedeagal shaft. C. mejdalanii spec. nov. seems to be more closely related to C. rugara DeLong & Freytag, 1976 because of the shape of the subapical aedeagal processes but differs from it by the enlarged apical area of the aedeagus, the absence of ventral pre-apical saliency of style, the rounder apex of the subgenital plate, and the longer pygofer, with a fold accompanying the whole lateral margin. C. maricaensis spec. nov. and C. restingalis spec. nov. seem to be closely related to C. esona DeLong & Freytag, 1976, as suggested by the general shape of internal genital parts, but differ from it by the shape of the apex of basal processes of the aedeagus, the apex of subgenital plates and the absence of an outer fold on the ventral margin of the pygofer.
