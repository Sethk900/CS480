Seasonal Effects of Four Control Methods on the Invasive Morrow’s Honeysuckle (Lonicera morrowii) and Initial Responses of Understory Plants in a Southwestern Pennsylvania Old Field.The first step in restoration often involves the removal of invasive plants, but few studies have determined if the response of plant communities matches management goals. The shrub Morrow's honeysuckle (<em>Lonicera morrowii </em>Gray) is one of a suite of exotic bush honeysuckle species that have become pervasive woody invaders in eastern North America. In 2004, we tested four control methods (cut, mechanical removal, stump application of glyphosate, and foliar application of glyphosate) during late spring and early autumn within a degraded meadow at Fort Necessity National Battlefield, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. Our restoration goals are to control Morrow's honeysuckle, restore native vegetation, and mimic the conditions present in the mid-1700s. We established forty-five 5 &times; 5-m plots to measure woody species; five plots of each treatment method were treated in spring, whereas the remaining five were treated in autumn. We maintained five control plots. Before control, mean density of Morrow's honeysuckle was 67,920 ± 4,480 shrubs/ha. Foliar application of herbicide and mechanical removal were most effective at reducing the number of shrubs (≥62%). Overall, our treatments were less successful (26-68% reduction) than reported control efforts of other bush honeysuckle species; the sheer number of shrubs coupled with their open habitat made control efforts difficult. Spring treatments, particularly cut and mechanical treatments, had higher metrics of herbaceous community quality. However, continued restoration efforts, including follow-up treatments, White-tailed deer (<em>Odocoileus virginianus</em>) control, and the planting of native seeds and saplings, should be employed to favor the establishment of native seedlings and herbs.
