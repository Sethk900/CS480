Euastacus morgani sp. n., a new spiny crayfish (Crustacea, Decapoda, Parastacidae) from the highland rainforests of eastern New South Wales, AustraliaAbstract Euastacus morgani sp. n., is described from a highland, rainforest site in Bindarri National Park, in eastern New South Wales, Australia. Euastacus morgani is found living sympatrically with two more common species, Euastacus dangadi Morgan, 1997 and Euastacus neohirsutus Riek, 1956. Systematically, the species belongs in the ‘simplex’ complex of the genus that includes Euastacus simplex Riek, 1956, Euastacus clarkae Morgan, 1997, Euastacus maccai McCormack and Coughran 2008 and E. morgani. This new species differs from its nearest congenor, Euastacus simplex, in having three mesial carpal spines. A key to the ‘simplex’ complex is presented.
