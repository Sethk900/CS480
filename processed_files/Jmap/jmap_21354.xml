A new Pseudachorutes (Collembola, Neanuridae, Pseudachorutinae) from NicaraguaAbstract A new species of Pseudachorutes is described and illustrated from Nicaragua. Pseudachorutes nica sp. n. is very easy to distinguish from other members of this genus from Central America, because its chaetotaxy consists of macro and microsetae and a postantennal organ with multiple vesicles (close to 20).
