Identification of tall fescue grass cultivars by sodium dodecyl sulphate and acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresisProtein banding patterns of seed obtained by sodium dodecyl sulphate Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) or acid Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (A-PAGE) were used to distinguish between different tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Shreb.) grass cultivars. An electrophoretic formula was determined for each cultivar using relative mobility and the number of protein bands. Distinctive band patterns were obtained enabling the cultivars to be identified using either the SDS-PAGE or the A-PAGE method. Banding patterns were independent of locality or year of production of the seed. Seed protein banding patterns can thus be used as a tool for taxonomie classification of tall fescue grass cultivars.
