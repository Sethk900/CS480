 Contribution to knowledge of the genus Haploops, a new location for Haploops lodo (Crustacea: Amphipoda: Ampeliscidae) from the bathyal North Atlantic Ocean with a complement to the description of the speciesOver the last two decades, several works on the family Ampeliscidae have been published, in particular about three of the four genera in the family: Ampelisca, Byblis, and Haploops. Recently, additional material collected during the BIOFAR sampling around the Faeroe Islands and during the BIOICE sampling around Iceland, in the Bay of Biscay and the EUMELI 2 campaign along the African coasts were examined. The genus Haploops was numerous (>3500 individuals), and within this material were interesting specimens. Six of them, found at four stations about 100Â km off Mauritania, have been recognized as Haploops lodo (Barnard, 1961) a bathyal and abyssal species previously seen only in the Pacific ocean offshore of the American coasts. In this article, an Atlantic H. lodo specimen representative of the Atlantic specimens is compared to the holotype. The geographical and bathymetric distribution of H. lodo in the depths of the North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are discussed.
