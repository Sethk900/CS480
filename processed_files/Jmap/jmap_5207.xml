Bot flies (Insecta: Oestridae, part) and Glossinidaeâ€“Hippoboscidae derive from basal Ephydroidea, not CalyptrataeThe ground plan of the bot flies (Oestridae, part) is compared with those of Ephydroidea and Calyptratae. Comparative anatomy suggests that the bot flies are unlikely to have arisen from within Calyptratae and that their derivation from near the base of Ephydroidea is more probable. A large body of evidence is assembled to counter the theory that would place Oestridae within the Tachinidae family-group. It is shown that Hippoboscoidea is unlikely to be monophyletic. The fit of Glossinidae to the suggested ground plan profile of the Ephydroidea/bot flies is shown to be good.
