Diet of the Neotropical Otter, Lontra longicaudis, in an Atlantic Forest Area, Santa Catarina State, Southern BrazilThe diet of the neotropical otter (Carnivora, Mustelidae) was studied from September 1995 to March 1997, in Volta Velha, an Atlantic Forest reserve in the coastal plain of Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil. Fecal samples were collected monthly along the rivers Saí-Mirim, Braço do Norte and Volta Velha. Additionally, from October 1996 to June 1997, a qualitative and quantitative study of fish species available in the studied rivers was performed. The analysis of 202 collected fecal samples indicated a diet based on fish (mainly Hoplias malabaricus and Geophagus brasiliensis) and crustaceans (mainly Trichodactylus fluviatilis, a river crab), characterizing the neotropical otter as piscivorous-cancrivorous in the study area. The presence of fruits, reptiles, birds and mammals in the diet is occasional and opportunistic. Probably the higher consumption of a certain fish species compared to its availability and the high percentage of occurrence of T. fluviatilis in scats of the neotropical otter reflect their higher catchability.
