Variation of herbicide transport parameters within a single field and its relation to water flux and soil propertiesThe variability of the transport characteristic of pesticides has rarely been investigated. In this study, 99 undisturbed soil columns representing a 1.8-ha field site in regular agricultural use were subjected to leaching tests with the two herbicides terbuthylazine and isoproturon. Emphasis was placed on the field-like flow conditions, such as water desaturation and moderate flow velocity (q=0.58 cm dâˆ’1). The flow field was characterised as homogeneous from breakthrough curves (BTCs) of the additional applied nonsorbing compound (bromide). Nevertheless, pronounced preferential flow with the simultaneous occurrence of all three applied chemicals was observed in seven samples. From the evaluation of the measured BTCs with a log-normal probability density function, it became obvious that the transport variability of the reactive chemicals was large compared with the conservative tracer. Whereas the transport parameters for bromide were not normally distributed, the influence of the adsorption process resulted in a normal distribution for the mobility coefficients of the herbicides. Linear adsorption coefficients (KD) assessed from the BTCs differed only slightly from those determined in equilibrium batch studies. Correlation analysis revealed that the KD values of terbuthylazine and isoproturon only depended to a minor extent on the organic carbon content of the soil (Corg). On the contrary, the mobility of all three compounds was related in the same way to texture parameters, indicating the predominance of the flow characteristic of the soil to herbicide adsorption under dynamic (flow) conditions. It is concluded that the classical Corg-based approach for the prediction of the movement of pesticides is insufficient for soils with moderate Corg; only knowledge of the effective flow field allows precise predictions.
