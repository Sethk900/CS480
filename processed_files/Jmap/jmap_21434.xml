A taxonomic study on semifumata species-group of Fissocantharis Pic, with description of six new species from China and Myanmar (Coleoptera, Cantharidae)Abstract The cantharid Fissocantharis semifumata species-groupis reviewed. Fissocantharis semifumata (Fairmaire, 1889) is redescribed and illustrated. The type series of Fissocantharis fissa (Wittmer, 1997) is shown to consist of 3 species and clarified, except the holotype, the two paratypes become invalid. Fissocantharis grahami (Wittmer, 1997) is attributed to this species group. Six new species are described and illustrated, Fissocanthais yui sp. n. (CHINA: Yunnan), Fissocantharis semimetallica sp. n. (CHINA: Yunnan; MYANMAR: Kachin), Fissocantharis bicolorata sp. n. (CHINA: Sichuan), Fissocantharis maculiceps sp. n. (CHINA: Gansu), Fissocantharis bimaculata sp. n. (CHINA: Sichuan) and Fissocantharis flava sp. n. (CHINA: Sichuan, Guizhou). The number of species in the Fissocantharis semifumata species-groupis increased from 4 to 11, and a key to all species is provided.
