Influence of edge and fire-induced changes on spatial distribution of small mammals in Brazilian Atlantic forest fragmentsThe spatial distribution of small mammals in relation to distance from forest edges, before and after fire, was studied in Atlantic Forest fragments in Brazil. None of nine species was captured exclusively on either edges or forest interior. Before the fire only the rodents Akodon cursor and Oecomys con-color were captured more often at the edge than randomly expected. After the fire only A. cursor remained associated with edges; it had increased in number and penetrated farther than before into the forest fragments. The marsupial Micoureus demerarae became more restricted to the forest interior than randomly expected. These results suggest that small mammal species tolerant to habitat changes induced by edge effects and fire have better chances to survive in forest fragments.
