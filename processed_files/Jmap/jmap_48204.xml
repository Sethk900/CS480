Signature extension versus retraining for multispectral classification of surface mines in arid regionsBecause governmental agencies are responsible for conducting mined land inventories on a regular basis, it is desirable to standardize the manipulation of the digital Landsut data for this purpose. Supervised classifica- tion of Landsat images was used in this study to map Arizona copper mining activity in order to demonstrate the utility of these images for dynamic, regional inventories of mined lands. A set of spectral signatures derived at a single, large mining complex were extended spatially and temporally to discriminate mining activity from natural terrain features at other sites. Accurate classifications were obtained using signature extension, and, in some cases, the accuracy ex- ceeded that obtained by retraining the classifier for individual mines.
