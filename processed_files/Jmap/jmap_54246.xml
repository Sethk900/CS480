Particle size fractionation of fungal and bacterial biomass in subalpine grassland and forest soilsCharacterization of soil aggregates according to particle size fractions is a useful tool in process-oriented research into soil organic matter and biological properties. Substrate-induced respiration (SIR) inhibition was used to quantify microbial, fungal and bacterial biomass in particle size fractions of soils ranging from forest to grassland in a subalpine region of central Taiwan. In addition, ergosterol content was determined in the same samples to verify fungal biomass measured by SIR inhibition technique. Surface soil (0–10 cm) was fractionated into four particle size fractions: coarse sand (250–2000 μm), fine sand (53–250 μm), silt (2–53 μm) and clay (0.2–2 μm). The larger sized fractions (>250 μm and 53–250 μm) contained higher levels of fungal ergosterol than the smaller sized ones (2–53 μm and 0.2–2 μm). The largest particle size fraction (250–2000 μm) from all studied habitats showed the highest level of microbial biomass, with no clear trend in microbial biomass level among the other size fractions. SIR-calculated fungal biomass level and ergosterol converted fungal biomass content were positively correlated (r=0.71, p<0.05), and such correlation decreased as biomass levels were high. Ratios of fungi to bacteria ranged between 0.6 and 1.3 in fractions obtained in this study. This study indicates a high variability of microbial (fungal and bacterial) biomass level among particle size fractions in soil, and that the large-sized fractions tend to contain a high level of microbial biomass in a given ecosystem.
