Living on the edge? – On the thermobiology and activity pattern of the large herbivorous desert lizard Uromastyx aegyptia microlepis Blanford, 1875 at Mahazat as-Sayd Protected Area, Saudi Arabia.Field active body temperatures (Tb) and operative temperatures (Te) were assessed in a population ofUromastyx aegyptia microlepis at Mahazat as-Sayd Protected Area, Saudi Arabia. In summer Tb ranged between 23.2 and 47.2 °C, in winter between 23.0 and 45.1 °C and in spring between 25.5 and 45.9 °C. There is a significant difference between respective Tb and Te distributions which suggests that U. a. microlepis is an active thermoregulator. Above ground activity is very variable between seasons, with the highest activity level in spring. In winter the animals showed an unimodal activity profile. In spring and summer the lizards exhibit bimodal activity profiles with afternoon activity being generally lower than morning activity levels. Species distribution models were calculated to estimate the future impact of global warming on this taxon. Estimates on the basis of temperature data suggest that the range size on the Arabian Peninsula might be stable but with a remarkable decrease of environmental suitability of up to 70–80%. Based on a synthesis of thermo-ecological data and species distribution models we consider climate warming as a potential threat to the survival of the species.
