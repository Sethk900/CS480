Plant consumption in coastal populations of the lizard Tropidurus torquatus (Reptilia: Squamata: Tropiduridae): how do herbivory rates vary along their geographic range?Tropidurus torquatus lizards commonly consume vegetal matter as part of their diet. However, it is not known to what extent the rate of consumption of plant material varies among populations. We investigated the consumption of plant material in 10 populations of T. torquatus in eastern Brazil. In all populations, lizards consumed plant matter (especially fruits and flowers). The proportion of plant volume in the diet varied from 2.1% to 58.0% of the total volume consumed. Differences in volumetric proportion of plant material consumed did not result from lizard body size or population latitude. The volumetric proportion of plant material did not differ between sexes at each locality; however, there was a slight trend for larger lizards to consume more plant parts. The data obtained indicate that the observed interpopulational variation in plant consumption by T. torquatus results from local environmental factors, mainly the availability of plant matter.
