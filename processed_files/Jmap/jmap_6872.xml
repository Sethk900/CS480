The karyotype of Sphiggurus villosus (Rodentia: Erethizontidae) from BrazilKaryotypic analysis was performed in two male specimens of Sphiggurus villosus collected in the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. The observed 2n = 42 / FN = 76 karyotype was similar to those of other Erethizontidae such as Erethizon dorsatum and Sphiggurus vestitus and to hystricomorph rodents like Myocastor coypus. Current karyotypic data showed that two species of the genus Coendou share the same diploid and fundamental numbers (2n = 74 / FN = 82) but 3 Sphiggurus species differ in diploid number while sharing the same fundamental number.
