Diet of Puma (Puma concolor, Carnivora: Felidae) in Coastal and Andean Ranges of Southern ChileBetween 1985 and 1999 we collected a total of 62 puma (Puma concolor) feces in two reserves located on the coastal range and on three national parks located in the Andean range, all in the Lake Region of southern Chile. The identification of 79 prey items showed that the puma diet in the southern rainforests was made up mainly of European hares (Lepus europaeus ; an exotic species), ungulates (chiefly the pudu deer; Pudu puda), rodents, birds and marsupials, in that order of importance. Except for the lowland site San Martín, the trophic ecology of pumas did not differ substantially among sites. At San Martín, in addition to hares, pumas hunted Black-necked swans (Cygnus melancoryphus) and coypu (Myocastor coypus). Although pumas preyed upon the largest prey available, the mean prey weight was of only 7.7 kg, much smaller than on other previous studies. European hares due to their high abundance, have replaced pudus as the main prey of pumas in the forests of the Lake Region. In order to maintain viable populations of pumas in the biologically most interesting coastal forests, it will be necessary to protect larger native forests that provide enough food and habitat for pumas.
