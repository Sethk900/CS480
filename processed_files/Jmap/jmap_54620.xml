Microstructure diversity in Ah horizons of black chernozemic soils, Alberta and British Columbia (Canada)Microstructure diversity was examined in A horizons of Black Chernozemic (Boroll) pedons in western Canada, with differences reflecting the interactions of parent material, faunal activity, and physical processes. Spongy microstructures, modified by frost processes to produce platy aggregates, occur in silty aeolian veneers in southern British Columbia. In central Alberta, intergrain micro-aggregate microstructures occur on sandy loam materials, whereas coarser crumb and granular aggregates, along with B horizon pedorelicts, are strongly developed on clay loam morainal materials. Trends in carbon content with aggregate size show corresponding diversity. Humus forms depart significantly from the mull considered typical of Chernozems, with these A horizons appearing most similar to the moder type.
