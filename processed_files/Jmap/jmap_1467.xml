Restoring Tree Islands in the Everglades: Experimental Studies of Tree Seedling Survival and Growth.In May 2004, 400 tree seedlings of seven different species found on tree islands in the Florida Everglades were planted at different elevations along five transects on eight newly constructed tree islands, four with and four without limestone cores. Seedlings suffered between 40 and 85% mortality during the first 120 days, the period with the lowest water levels. <em>Ilex cassine</em> L., <em>Salix caroliniana</em> Michx., <em>Chrysobalanus icaco</em> L., and <em>Annona glabra</em> had the highest number of surviving seedlings, whereas <em>Magnolia virginiana</em> L., <em>Myrica cerifera</em> L., and <em>Acer rubrum</em> L. had the fewest. During the remainder of the study, water levels were mostly higher and sometimes covered the entire islands for months at a time. After 220 days, nearly all seedlings of <em>M. virginiana</em> and <em>My. cerifera</em> had died. At the end of the study, seedlings of <em>I. cassine</em> and <em>A. glabra</em> had the highest survivorship rates. Seedling biomass of <em>C. icaco</em> and <em>I. cassine</em> was greatest at the highest elevations, whereas seedlings of <em>A. glabra</em> had similar biomass at all elevations. Seedling survivorship was not statistically different between islands with and without limestone cores; however, when seedlings of all species were combined, island core type was significantly different for aboveground biomass, seedling height, and canopy width. Because of the higher survivorship under both low and high water conditions, <em>A. glabra</em>, <em>I. cassine</em>, and <em>S. caroliniana</em> are the most suitable species for establishing tree species on restored tree islands in the Everglades.
