A redescription of the fossil coleoid cephalopod genus Palaeololigo Naef, 1921 (Decapodiformes: Palaeololiginidae) and its relationship to Recent squidsNeocoleoid cephalopods are poorly represented in the fossil record and fossils which can be confidently aligned with extant species are very scarce. The rare Solnhofen genus Palaeololigo is an exception to this, showing marked resemblance to Recent squids. Naef misinterpreted the structure of the fossilized gladius of Palaeololigo and the present study redescribes the genus. The gladius and fossilized fin impressions of Palaeololigo closely resemble that of the extant decapodiform squid genera Bathyteuthis and Chtenopteryx (Superfamily Bathyteuthoidea). The possible relationship between Palaeololigo and the bathyteuthoids and their position in decapodiform phylogenetics is discussed.
