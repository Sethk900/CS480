Brood Habitats of Sympatric Sage Grouse and Columbian Sharp-Tailed Grouse in WyomingHabitats used by sympatric sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and Columbian sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus columbianus) were compared. Sage grouse broods occurred most often  (68%) in sagebrush (Artemisia spp.)-grass and sagebrush-bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) habitats, whereas sharp-tailed grouse broods occurred most often (73%) in mountain shrub and sagebrush-snowberry (Symphoricarpos oreophilus) habitats. Mountain shrub and sagebrush-snowberry habitats were used by sharp-  tailed grouse more (P < 0.05) than expected based on their availability. Broods of both species used areas  within each habitat with less shrub cover than average for that habitat. Sharp-tailed grouse broods were  associated with mountain snowberry, oniongrass (Melica spp.), and sulphur buckwheat (Eriogonum umbellatum). Sites used by sage grouse contained needle-and-thread (Stipa comata) and desert alyssum (Alyssum  desertorum).
