Digital Photogrammetric Monitoring of River Bank ErosionDetailed understanding of the processes which control river bank erosion requires high resolution information concerning temporal changes in bank morphology. This paper describes the successful use of digital photogrammetry to extract high resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) from terrestrial oblique stereopairs of rapidly eroding river banks, using the commercial software package Erdas Imagine. This software was developed for use with aerial photography and satellite imagery; problems relating to the use of oblique terrestrial images are discussed and solutions presented. Photography was acquired using semi-metric cameras, mounted on tripods and positioned about 15m from the eroding bank. Data for DEM point spacings of 20mm were obtained, with accuracies of approximately Â±12mm in depth. Digital photogrammetry can permit faster analysis, provide better accuracies and involve less ground disturbance than conventional methods of monitoring river channel change. Most importantly, DEM generation is considered to be more useful than traditionally acquired points or profiles for landform monitoring strategies.
