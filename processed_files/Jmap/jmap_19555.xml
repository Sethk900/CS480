Soil CO(2) efflux vs. soil respiration: Implications for flux modelsIn the long term, all CO(2) produced in the soil must be emitted by the surface and soil CO(2) efflux (F(CO2)) must correspond to soil respiration (R(soil)). In the short term, however, the efflux can deviate from the instantaneous soil respiration, if the amount of CO(2) stored in the soil pore-space (S(CO2)) is changing. We measured F(CO2) continuously for one year using an automated chamber system. Simultaneously, vertical soil profiles of CO(2) concentration, moisture, and temperature were measured in order to assess the changes in the amount of CO(2) stored in the soil. R(soil) was calculated as the sum of the rate of change of the CO(2) storage over time and Fah. The experiment was split into a warm and a cold season. The dependency of soil respiration and soil efflux on soil temperature and on soil moisture was analyzed separately. Only the moisture-driven model of the warm season was significantly different for F(CO2) and R(soil). At our site, a moisture-driven soil-respiration model derived from CO(2) efflux data would underestimate the importance of soil moisture. This effect can be attributed to a temporary storage of CO(2) in the soil pore-space after rainfalls where up to 40% of the respired CO(2) were stored. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
