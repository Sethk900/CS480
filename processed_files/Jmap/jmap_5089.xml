Three new species of Exorista Meigen (Diptera: Tachinidae), with a discussion of the evolutionary pattern of host use in the genusFive Exorista species from Malaysia and Indonesia are treated and diagnostic characters of the male postabdomen are illustrated. Three of them are described as new: Exorista globosa sp. nov., E. flaviventris sp. nov. and E. sabahensis sp. nov. Phylogenetic analysis is performed with previously published morphological data along with the five species treated here. Based on the generated tree, the five species treated here are assigned to Spixomyia Crosskey. Exorista ladelli (Baranov) is transferred to Spixomyia from the subgenus Podotachina Brauer and Bergenstamm. Evolutionary patterns of host use in the genus Exorista Meigen are discussed. Host information is optimized on the resultant tree under the most parsimonious reconstruction. The original host of the tribe Exoristini (except Ctenophorinia Mesnil and Phorinia Robineau-Desvoidy) was order Lepidoptera, and transitions to other orders (Hymenoptera, Mantodea and Orthoptera) occurred in subgenera Adenia Robineau-Desvoidy and Spixomyia, respectively.
