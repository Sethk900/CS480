Genetic Bottlenecks Resulting from Restoration Efforts: The Case of Bighorn Sheep in Badlands National ParkUsing the example of a reintroduced bighorn sheeppopulation in Badlands National Park, South Dakotawe demonstrate the usefulness of neutrality tests anddemographic data for detecting a severe genetic bottleneck(Ne,10). From demographic data the effectivepopulation size of the founding population atBadlands was estimated to be six, and a heterozygosityexcess test revealed evidence of a severe populationbottleneck. We discuss the criteria for interventionwhen there is evidence of a severe bottleneck,and propose methods of mitigating the potentially deleterious long-term consequences of such bottlenecks.These issues are presented in the context ofbighorn sheep reintroductions, but the issues are alsoof general importance to restoration efforts involvingother large vertebrates.
