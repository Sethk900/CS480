The following 11 species are described as new: Oberthuerella cyclopia Buffington & van Noort; Oberthuerella eschara Buffington & van Noort; Oberthuerella kibalensis van Noort & Buffington; Oberthuerella pardolatus Buffington & van Noort; Oberthuerella sharkeyi Buffington & van Noort; Oberthuerella simba Buffington & van Noort; Tessmannella copelandi Buffington & van Noort; Tessmannella kiplingi Buffington & van Noort; Tessmannella roberti Buffington & van Noort; Xenocynips rhothion Buffington & van Noort; and Xenocynips ronquisti Buffington & van Noort. We provide identification keys to the genera and species occurring in the Afrotropical region.
