An assessment of the variation for stem rust resistance in the progeny of a cross involving the Triticum species aestivum, turgidum and tauschiiAccession RL5289 of Triticum tauschii and Triticum turgidum var. durum cv. Cando showed resistance to the prevailing stem rust races of South Africa. RL5289 was crossed with Cando. An amphiploid was produced and crossed with the common wheat line W107. Three cycles of crosses of resistant derivatives to the common wheat cvs. Inia 66 and SST3 were then made. Five resistant F1 plants from the final crosses were planted and used to obtain five sets of F2-derived F3 populations which were tested for their stem rust resistance, agronomic and quality characteristics. Two F4 populations (87M66-2-1 and 87M66-5-6) were then derived as agronomically superior families that appeared to breed true for individual stem rust resistance genes. Monosomie analyses of 87M66-2-1 and 87M66-5-6 implicated chromosome 1D as carrying stem rust resistance genes. Selection 87M66-2-1 has a dominant resistance gene which appears to derive from Triticum tauschii accession RL5289. While the gene is not very effective against Canadian isolates of stem rust, it is a new source of resistance to stem rust of common wheat in South Africa. The resistance of 87M66-5-6 may involve more than one gene.
