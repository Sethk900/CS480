COMPARATIVE STUDIES OF CYCLING SOIL ORGANIC CARBON IN 3 PRIMEVAL MOIST FORESTSCycling of soil organic C in 3 types of forest were analyzed by a compartment model, and compared with each other. The accumulation of soil organic C became larger, but the flow rates of soil C decreased from a tropical rain forest through an evergreen oak forest to a beech/fir forest. The calculated half life of A0 layer was 0.4, 1.2 and 4.0 yr at the tropical rain, the evergreen oak and beech/fir forests, respectively. Ratios of each flow rate of soil C to the total soil respiration rate in 3 forests were constant regardless of forest type and turnover rate of soil C. All flow rates of soil C were formulated as a function of the accumulation of A0 layer which suggested A0 layer to be a most sensitive indicator of cycling of soil organic C in forest ecosystems.
