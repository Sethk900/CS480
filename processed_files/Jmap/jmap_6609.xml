Effect of time and rate of nitrogen application on the malting quality of barleyField trials were conducted to determine the effect of time and rate of single and split applications of nitrogen on various malting parameters of barley. The effect of a single low nitrogen application of 50 kg Nha−1 at sowing was compared with high nitrogen applications of 150 kg N ha−1 given as split applications at different growth stages. The barley was malted in an automatic micro-malting system and the malt analysed for various quality parameters. A number of the high nitrogen applications significantly increased total nitrogen, soluble nitrogen, free amino-nitrogen, and alpha- and beta-amylase activity, whereas the fine-grind extract was not significantly affected. The growth stage at which supplementary nitrogen was applied significantly affected all malting parameters except the total nitrogen content. Highest values in general were found when split applications of nitrogen were done at five different growth stages until ear emergence.
