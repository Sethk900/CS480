Mycorrhizal fungi determine salt-marsh plant zonation depending on nutrient supply.<ol><li>Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can affect nutrient uptake of associated plants and can vary in function from mutualism to parasitism as nutrient availability increases; thus they may interact with nutrient availability to influence plant community structure.</li><li>We experimentally investigated the hypotheses that AMF can affect the community structure of salt marshes by affecting plant competitive ability. We focused on: <em>Spartina densiflora</em>, that dominates physically benign high marsh habitats and <em>S. alterniflora</em>, which dominates more stressful low marsh habitats.</li><li>Colonization by AMF increased <em>S. densiflora</em> growth at low nutrient levels, but reduced growth at high nutrient levels. <em>Spartina alterniflora</em> was not colonized by AMF and showed increased growth only with nutrient amendment. Nutrient or fungicide additions resulted in <em>S. alterniflora</em> migrating to higher marsh elevations, displacing <em>S. densiflora</em>. When nutrient and fungicide additions were made together, however, dominance of <em>S. densiflora</em> was maintained in the high marsh.</li><li>â€‚<em>Synthesis.</em> These results show that AMF can affect the competitive ability of plants and can have a large impact on plant community structure. The community impacts of these symbioses may be especially sensitive to human-induced eutrophication, given that nutrient supply can modulate whether AMF positively or negatively affect associated plants.</li></ol>
