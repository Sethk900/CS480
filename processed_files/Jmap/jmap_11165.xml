Root and rhizome systems of perennial grasses grown in Inner Mongolian grassland, ChinaThe root and rhizome systems of dominant perennial grasses in Inner Mongolian grassland were clarified. We surveyed the vertical distribution of root and rhizome biomass in the natural stands, and the changes of under-ground biomass and the branching pattern of rhizomes for transplanted plants in a container experiment. Most roots of Leymus chinensis, Bromus inermis, Elymus dahuricus and Agropyron cristatum were distributed in the soil depth of 0–10 cm. Roots of E. dahuricus and A. cristatum were distributed in a shallower soil layer, but those of L. chinensis and B. inermis were distributed in a deeper soil layer. Biomass of above-ground parts increased with growth, resulting in a decreasing ratio of under-ground parts to total biomass. Rhizomes of L. chinensis and B. inermis were distributed in the soil depth of 0–10 cm, but E. dahuricus and A. cristatum did not have rhizomes. L. chinensis had longer rhizomes and new ramets were produced away from their mother plant. B. inermis had many short rhizomes and produced daughter plants near their mother plant.
