On the morphology of the terminal-instar larvae of some European species of Sycophila (Hymenoptera: Eurytomidae) parasitoids of gall wasps (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae)Following previous work developed on Eurytoma Illiger larvae belonging to the same community, we study the morphology of terminal-instar larvae of five species representative of Sycophila parasitoids of gall wasps (Hymenoptera, Cynipidae) in Europe. The terminal-instar larvae of S. biguttata (Swederus), S. binotata (Fonscolombe), S. flavicollis (Walker), S. mayri (Erdös) and S. submutica (Thomson), are described for the first time based on scanning electron microscope images. The morphological characters distinguishing them from other eurytomid larvae include: general chaetotaxy reduction; deep divisions of labrum into seven lobes and reduction of mandible size. Although we found limited variation in body shape, studied species share important diagnostic characters on the head, mouthparts and mandibles potentially with systematic value. Biological data of studied species are discussed and illustrated with photographs. Sycophila mayri and S. submutica are associated with cynipid galls on herbs; S. biguttata, S. binotata and S. flavicollis are parasitoids in cynipid galls on Quercus trees.
