Variation and distribution in the treeâ€frog genus Phyllomedusa in Costa Rica, central AmericaResume The frog genus Phyllomedusa is represented in Costa Rica by six species. Analysis of variation in coloration, webbing, and measurements delineates features that distinguish the various forms. The characteristics of the flank pattern in the nominal species P. callidryas and P. helenae, utilized by previous authors to separate them, are shown to be subject to individual and geographic variation. The two forms represent two of many populations within a single species, P. callidryas. Reasons for not using the term subspecies for geographic segments of callidryas are presented. The diagnostic features and the geographic and ecologic distribution of the Costa Rican species, P. annae, P. calcarifer, P. callidryas, P. lemur, P. saltator and P. spurrelli, based on the entire species ranges, are discussed.
