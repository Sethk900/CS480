Seasonal and interannual variability in surface energy partitioning and vegetation cover with grazing at shortgrass steppe.We evaluated shortgrass steppe energy budgets based on the Bowen Ratio Energy Balance method for three different grazing intensity treatments at the Central Plains Experimental Range Long-Term Ecological Research (CPER-LTER) site. We tested the correlations between aboveground biomass and surface energy fluxes for three different precipitation years based on continuously measured 20 min interval data.
