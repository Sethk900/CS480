A new Ecuadorian species of the rare Neotropical caddisfly genus Amphoropsyche Holzenthal (Trichoptera, Leptoceridae)Abstract A new species of the rare long-horned caddisfly genus Amphoropsyche Holzenthal is described from Ecuador, bringing the number of species known from the genus to 15. All species are very regional in their distributions and known only from very few specimens. The new species, Amphoropsyche real, is similar to a number of previously described species from Colombia (A. ayura, A. cauca, A. flinti, A. quebrada, and A. stellata) and Ecuador (A. napo and A. tandayapa). The males can be distinguished from the others by features of segment X of the male genitalia, especially the prominent midlateral and subapicodorsal spinelike setae. An updated taxonomic key to males of the genus is provided.
