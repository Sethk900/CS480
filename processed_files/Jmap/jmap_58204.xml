Setting Water Quality Trigger Levels for the Operation and Management of a MAR System in Parafield, South AustraliaAbstractSetting of critical control and monitoring point trigger limits for water quality in managed aquifer recharge (MAR) schemes ensures human health, environmental, and operational risks are controlled. Application of a transferrable methodology for selection of appropriate critical limits and setting of alert limits for MAR systems is demonstrated for a storm water aquifer storage and recovery scheme used for nonpotable applications in Parafield, South Australia. This is the first demonstrated application of an approach incorporating hazard analysis and critical control point principles for setting water quality targets in a storm water MAR system consistent with Australian Water Recycling Guidelines and Australian and international drinking water guidelines. Salinity and Escherichia coli (E. coli) are used as example parameters but others follow the same principles. A decision tree was developed for systematic selection of relevant targets and setting of critical and alert limits. Up to 10 years of operational water quality data across the system were used for the analyses. Comparison of injected and recovered water using a stochastic model showed the aquifer could be expected to provide a mean E. coli removal of approximately 2.0  log. A mean E. coli reduction of 39% in the distribution system following a change in operational procedures was predicted using the probabilistic model. Long-term data were used to set alert limits for critical control and quality monitoring points in the system. Management actions following occasions where limits were not met are discussed.
