Identification of Cyclopia species (‘Heuningbostee’) using Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresisProtein banding patterns of seed obtained by sodium dodecyl sulphate Polyacrylamide get electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) or acid polycrylamide gel electrophoresis (A-PAGE) were used to distinguish between different Cyclopia species (‘heuningbostee’). An electrophoretic formula was determined for each species using relative band mobility and the number of protein bands Distinctive band patterns were obtained enabling the species to be identified using either SDS-PAGE or A-PAGE Banding patterns showed that this technique can be used as a tool for taxonomic classification of Cyclopia species.
