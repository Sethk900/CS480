Moss Regeneration for Fen Restoration: Field and Greenhouse Experiments.Fen bryophytes are an important component of natural fens and should be included in fen restoration projects. The goal of this study was to examine the regeneration capabilities of nine bryophytes common to moderate-rich and poor fens in North America. A greenhouse experiment was carried out to examine the limitations and optima for the regeneration of fen bryophytes under different light and water regimes. A field experiment tested these same bryophytes in the presence of three potential nurse-plants. In the greenhouse experiment, the presence of shade increased regeneration success for eight out of nine species. A high water level was ideal for the regeneration of the majority of species tested. In the field experiment, <em>Sphagnum</em> species had the highest regeneration, and all species had higher regeneration under a dense canopy of herbaceous plants. Fen bryophytes show good potential for use in restoration projects because the tested bryophytes regenerated well from fragments.
