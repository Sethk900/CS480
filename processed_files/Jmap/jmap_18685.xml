Patterns of forest floor respiration in broadleaf and conifer forest ecosystems in parts of Central HimalayaCarbon dioxide evolution rates from the floors of broadleaf and conifer forests were measured by an alkali absorption method. The rate of CO-2 evolution was highest (193-362 mg CO-2 m-1 hr-1) during rainy season followed by summer season and lowest (38-75 Mg CO-2 m-1 hr-1) during winter season. The rate of CO-2 evolution was higher in broadleaf forests (62-362 mg CO-2 m-2 hr-1) than in conifer forests (38-282 Mg CO-2 m-2 hr-1). During winter season when conditions were less favourable to microbial activity root respiration accounted for a sizeable proportion (37 to 48%) of the total soil respiration.
