The effects of temporal variation in soil carbon inputs on resource allocation in an annual plantAims Resource allocation in plants can be strongly affected by competition. Besides plantâ€“plant interactions, terrestrial plants compete with the soil bacterial community over nutrients. Since the bacterial communities cannot synthesize their own energy sources, they are dependent on external carbon sources. Unlike the effect of overall amounts of carbon (added to the soil) on plant performance, the effect of fine scale temporal variation in soil carbon inputs on the bacterial biomass and its cascading effects on plant growth are largely unknown. We hypothesize that continuous carbon supply (small temporal variance) will result in a relatively constant bacterial biomass that will effectively compete with plants for nutrients. On the other hand, carbon pulses (large temporal variance) are expected to cause oscillations in bacterial biomass, enabling plants temporal escape from competition and possibly enabling increased growth. We thus predicted that continuous carbon supply would increase root allocation at the expense of decreased reproductive output. We also expected this effect to be noticeable only when sufficient nutrients were present in the soil.
