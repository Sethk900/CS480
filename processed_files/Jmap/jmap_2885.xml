Atmospheric nitrogen deposition in the northern Chihuahuan desert: Temporal trends and potential consequencesRates and impacts of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition are poorly understood in and land ecosystems where soils are typically low in plant available N. To address this issue, we quantified long-term trends in N deposition and estimated its impact on plant community structure in the northern Chihuahuan desert of Central New Mexico, USA. Annual and seasonal rates of N deposition were strongly positively correlated with precipitation. When precipitation effects were removed statistically, N deposition increased Lit an annual rate of 0.049 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) between 1989 and 2004. Based on two independent fertilization studies Lit Our desert grassland field site, continued atmospheric inputs are likely to increase grass cover, decrease legume abundance, and may favor blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) at the expense of the Current dominant species. black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda). We conclude that, although and lands have low rates of N deposition and are primarily water limited, observed trends in N deposition rates may lead to significant changes in plant community structure.
