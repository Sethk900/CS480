New Expression of the Hydraulic Jump Roller LengthAbstractThis paper presents the results of an experimental investigation on the roller length of both classical and B-jumps on smooth beds. Using the measurements conducted in this investigation and those available in the literature, a new relationship is proposed for estimating the roller length of classical and B-jumps on smooth beds. Finally, it is demonstrated that the proposed equation is also applicable to estimate the roller length of hydraulic jumps on rough horizontal beds.
