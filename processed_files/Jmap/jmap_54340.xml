Changes in the micromorphology and analytical properties of a Gray Luvisol (Cryoboralf) under a 49 year old forage standSoils under a 49 year old forage stand and a three year old forage stand in a forage/grain rotation, were compared with nearby virgin forest soil at a site near Winfield, Alberta (Canada). Cultivation destroyed the moder humus LFH layers and the banded fabric of the Ae, creating a matrigranic fabric sequence in both agricultural soils. Frequent craze planes, channels, and aggrotubules were found in the upper Ap horizon of the cultivated forage/grain rotation field. In mineral soil total C, N, and biomass were increased after a half century under continuous forage. A thick moder turf layer and a dense vughy porphyric Ap horizon, with very fine root channels and few planar voids or aggrotubules, have developed. There are no visible signs of the formation of a significant (Chernozem-like) mull horizon. Meso- and macrofaunal activity was limited almost exclusively to the organic layer (turf) in this stand. Introduction of a continuous grass stand has not induced mull-forming biological processes to replace the physico-chemical lessivage processes characteristic of the Gray Luvisolic soils.
