Cactus species turnover and diversity along a latitudinal transect in the Chihuahuan Desert RegionA standardized sampling method was used to evaluate turnover (beta diversity) among cactus species assemblages along a 798 km long latitudinal megatransect across the Chihuahuan Desert Region, from north-central Mexico to southern Texas. A total of 71 cactus species were found along the megatransect, 66.2% of which appeared at low frequencies, mostly as a consequence of their highly discontinuous distribution pattern. At the scale the study was conducted, there was always species turnover among cactus assemblages. The rate of turnover among contiguous sites primarily fluctuated from low to medium, but when all site combinations were considered (contiguous and non-contiguous), medium beta diversity values were predominant (beta = 0.331-0.66); however, 25.4% of the site pair combinations registered high values (beta = 0.661-1.0). Our results showed that turnover among cactus species assemblages in the CDR does not consist for the most part of a process of species succession in the geographic space. Instead, we concluded that the continuous spatial changes in cactus species composition are primarily explained by the commonly intermittent distribution patterns of the species, by the presence in the megatransect of species at the margin of their distribution range, and, to a lesser extent, by the existence of narrowly endemic species.
