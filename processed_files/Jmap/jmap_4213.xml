Habitat variation and lizard diversity in a Cerrado area of Central BrazilAbstract Lizard richness, composition and local distribution were studied in a 6000 ha preserved tract of Cerrado in central Brazil. Recorded richness, with 17 species in seven families, is higher than most presented for Cerrado localities. The lizard assemblage is significantly structured in terms of local distribution, being dominated by species with strict and predictable habitat requirements, following the mosaic of available habitats. A large portion of the species recorded is exclusive to open, interfluvial habitats. Faunal overlap between gallery forests and open habitats was extremely restricted. Previous interpretations describing the Cerrado lizard fauna as depauperate and similar to the fauna of other open Neotropical domains were not corroborated. Instead, our results corroborate recent interpretations pointing out horizontal stratification and habitat patchyness as strong factors influencing the rich, complex and characteristic Cerrado lizard fauna.
