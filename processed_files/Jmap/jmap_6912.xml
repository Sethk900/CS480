Distributional Evidence for Cospeciation between Neotropical Bats and their Bat Fly EctoparasitesDistributional evidence bearing on cospeciation of New World bats (superfamily Noctilionoidea) and associated bat flies (Diptera: Streblidae) was analyzed and revealed substantial phylogenetic structure, especially when we focused on "normal" host associations and encoded the data set hierarchically. Brooks' parsimony analyses of bat fly occurrences among hosts recovered generally accepted sets of host relationships. Putatively monophyletic host taxa provide a necessary but insufficient condition for coevolution via cospeciation.
