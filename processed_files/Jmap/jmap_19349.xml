Water- and plant-mediated responses of soil respiration to topography, fire, and nitrogen fertilization in a semiarid grassland in northern ChinaSoil respiration is one of the major carbon (C) fluxes between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere and plays an important role in regulating the responses of ecosystem and global C cycling to natural and anthropogenic perturbations. A field experiment was conducted between April 2005 and October 2006 in a semiarid grassland in northern China to examine effects of topography, fire, nitrogen (N) fertilization, and their potential interactions on soil respiration. Mean soil respiration was 6.0% higher in the lower than upper slope over the 2 growing seasons. Annual burning in early spring caused constant increases in soil respiration (23.8%) over the two growing seasons. In addition, fire effects on soil respiration varied with both season and topographic position. Soil respiration in the fertilized plots was 11.4% greater than that in the unfertilized plots. Water- and plant-mediation could be primarily responsible for the changes in soil respiration with topography and after fire whereas the positive responses of soil respiration to N fertilization were attributable to stimulated plant growth, root activity and respiration. The different mechanisms by which topography, fire, and N fertilization influence soil respiration identified in this study will facilitate the simulation and projection of ecosystem C cycling in the semiarid grassland in northern China.
