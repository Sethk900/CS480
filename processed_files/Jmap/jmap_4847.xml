A new species of Notostrix (Acari: Eriophyidae), with notes on the host plants and distribution of species of this genusThirteen Notostrix Keifer species are presently known, all from leaves of palm trees (Arecaceae) to which they seemingly cause no major damage. A new species of this genus, Notostrix macrothrix sp. nov., is morphologically described based on adult females and males collected from coconut, Cocos nucifera L. (Arecaceae), on La Reuni√≥n Island. A discussion about the presently known distribution of mites of this genus is also presented. http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:14C65CB2-AF56-4D85-AD49-56FA11119EF5
