Three new genera of Neotropical Mimallonidae (Lepidoptera, Mimallonoidea, Mimallonidae) with descriptions of three new speciesThree new genera of Mimallonidae are described. The monotypic genus Tostallo gen. n. is erected to contain â€œPerophoraâ€ albescens Jones, 1912, which was previously placed in the preoccupied genus Perophora Harris, 1841 and was never formally moved to a valid genus. Perophora is a junior homonym of Cicinnus Blanchard, 1852, but the name albescens is not appropriately placed in Cicinnus due to external and genitalia characteristics entirely unique to the species albescens. The female of Tostallo albescens comb. n. is described and both sexes are figured for the first time. Auroriana gen. n. is erected to contain A. florianensis (Herbin, 2012), comb. n. previously described as Cicinnus florianensis, and two new species: A. colombiana sp. n. from Colombia and A. gemma sp. n. from southeastern and southern Brazil. The female of A. florianensis is described and figured for the first time. Finally, the monotypic genus Micrallo gen. n. is erected to include a new species, M. minutus sp. n. described from northeastern Brazil.
