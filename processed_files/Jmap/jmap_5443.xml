Redescription of Alona macracantha Smirnov and Timms, 1983 and its assignment to Maraura gen. nov. (Cladocera: Anomopoda: Chydoridae)A morphological investigation of the Australian cladoceran Alona macracantha Smirnov and Timms, 1983 revealed numerous differences from all other species of the genus and prompted its assignment to Maraura gen. nov. Main diagnostic characters of the new genus include an elongated rostrum, Monospilusâ€like postabdomen, long, sinuous basal spine of postabdominal claw, absence of accessory seta of limb I, thickened scrapers 3 and 5 of limb II, and exopodites of limb IIIâ€“V fused with the main body of the limb. The affinities and taxonomic position of this rare Australian endemic are discussed.
