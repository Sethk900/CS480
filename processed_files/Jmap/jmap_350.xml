Strawberry-Flavored Baits for Pharmaceutical Delivery to Feral Swine.More effective methods to control feral swine (<em>Sus scrofa</em>) damage are needed. We evaluated 8 oral delivery systems designed to deliver pharmaceuticals to feral swine on 2 properties in southern Texas, USA. We used modified PIGOUTÂ® feral pig bait (Animal Control Technologies Australia P/L, Somerton, Victoria, Australia) throughout our trials to compare species-specific visitation and removal rates. Given our consistent finding of high nontarget removal of baits intended for feral swine, we question whether a swine-specific oral delivery system exists for this region.
