Modeling Nutritional Carrying Capacity for Translocated Desert Bighorn Sheep in Western Texas.Restoration of desert bighorn sheep (<em>Ovis canadensis</em>) is proceeding in several western states. Measurement of nutritional resources (quality and quantity) is not normally conducted to assess future and present translocation sites, although it has been recommended generally for evaluation of ungulate habitat. We estimated nutritional carrying capacity (based on nitrogen in forage species) of three mountain ranges in Trans-Pecos Texas where desert bighorn sheep have been translocated. We used an explicit nutritional constraint model to estimate carrying capacity on a seasonal basis. Although drought conditions prevailed during the study period, bighorns were not limited by quantity of vegetation. However, forage biomass of high nutritional quality (>1.5% N) was very low (<9 kg/ha in spring; <1 kg/ha in all other seasons). Consequently, there appeared to be inadequate forage of high N content for bighorns to meet reproductive requirements in some seasons. Estimates generated using the explicit nutritional constraint carrying capacity model appeared to be realistic relative to observed densities. Nutritional sampling and modeling can predict potential carrying capacity on areas scheduled for restoration or on ranges already stocked, predict effects of management on carrying capacity, and allow managers to compare among restoration sites. We recommend that desert bighorn managers focus on monitoring the abundance of high-quality (%N) forage species, especially during periods of drought or higher nutritional requirements (e.g., lactation, post-weanling growth).
