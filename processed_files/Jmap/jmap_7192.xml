Vertical distribution and abundance of arthropods from white sand soil of a Neotropical Campinarana forest during the rainy seasonAbout 74,000 arthropods per m2 soil were extracted in a dryland forest on white sand soil (campinarana) near Manaus, Brazil, during the rainy season in early 1986. About 58% of all arthropods lived in the top 3.5 cm, 16% underneath (3,5â€“7 cm depth), and only 6% in 7â€“14 cm depth. Acari and Collembola represented nearly 80% of the total catch. Disregarding these two orders, Formiâ€cidae, Pauropoda, Diplura and Protura amounted to more than 50% of the total catch. Decreasing arthropod abundance with greater soil depth corresponded with data already known from other neotropical dryland forests, but was not significantly correlated with increasing soil humidity. No indication is found yet that arthropods of Central Amazonian dryland forests migrate to the mineral subsoil as a response to changing abiotic factors in the organic layer due to seasons, as reported from forests in the seasonal tropics.
