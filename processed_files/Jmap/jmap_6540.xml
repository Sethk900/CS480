The association between residual chlorophyll and grassy taste in black teaThe ‘grassy’ taste in some South African and Central African black teas is not up to tea tasters' and buyers' standards. It has been shown by a number of researchers that this taste is associated with volatiles in the tea leaves. In this study it was shown that grassy taste found by tea tasters is also connected with residual chlorophyll in processed black tea.
