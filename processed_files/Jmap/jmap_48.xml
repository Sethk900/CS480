Restoration of Species-Rich, Nutrient-Limited Mountain Grassland by Mowing and Fertilization.Mowing and management to reduce nutrient levels have often been successfully used to restore species-rich grasslands in various parts of Europe. However, such treatments have failed to restore the species-rich Central European mountain grasslands dominated by <em>Polygonum bistorta</em>. <em>P. bistorta</em> builds an extensive underground rhizome system that monopolizes available nutrients in these nutrient-poor grasslands, enabling this species to persist at high densities even in the presence of mowing. Therefore, we tested a restoration approach using a factorial combination of fertilization and mowing, as well as a litter removal treatment. The experiment was run over 5 years and species composition response to these treatments was recorded at two spatial scales.
