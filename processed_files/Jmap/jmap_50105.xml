Patterns of asymmetry in body traits and genitalia in two distant populations of a Neotropical scorpionThe ability of a genotype to control the stable development of a phenotype under different environmental conditions may explain the level of developmental instability. An indicator to developmental instability is Fluctuating Asymmetry. Traits under pressures of sexual selection exhibit greater values of asymmetry that others. These traits have more physiological requirements during morphogenesis and a more complex development. The aims of this work are to analyze asymmetry patterns of genitalic and somatic traits in the scorpion Bothriurus bonariensis (Bothriuridae) and to compare these values between central and peripheral populations of its distribution. We observed that types of asymmetry in genitalic traits differed in both populations. Also, traits of the hemispermatophores (two halves that constitute the spermatophore) showed the highest levels of fluctuating asymmetry, particularly in those characteristics with important role for insemination success. This work offers fundamental baseline knowledge for further works focused on asymmetry of genitalia and mating success in scorpions.
