Ecosystem productivity can be predicted from potential relative growth rate and species abundance.We show that ecosystem-specific aboveground net primary productivity (SANPP, g g<sup>-;1</sup> day<sup>-;1</sup>, productivity on a per gram basis) can be predicted from species-level measures of potential relative growth rate (RGR<sub>max</sub>), but only if RGR<sub>max</sub> is weighted according to the species' relative abundance. This is in agreement with Grime's mass-ratio hypothesis. Productivity was measured in 12 sites in a French Mediterranean post-agricultural succession, while RGR<sub>max</sub> was measured on 26 of the most abundant species from this successional sere, grown hydroponically. RGR<sub>max</sub> was only weakly correlated (<em>r</em><sup>2</sup> = 0.12, <em>P</em> < 0.05) with field age when species abundance was not considered, but the two variables were strongly correlated (<em>r</em><sup>2</sup> = 0.81, <em>P</em> < 0.001) when the relative abundance of species in each field was taken into account. SANPP also decreased significantly with field age. This resulted in a tight relationship (<em>r</em><sup>2</sup> = 0.77, <em>P</em> < 0.001) between productivity and RGR<sub>max</sub> weighted according to species relative biomass contribution. Our study shows that scaling-up from the potential properties of individual species is possible, and that information on potential and realized species traits can be integrated to predict ecosystem functioning.
