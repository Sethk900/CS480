Laboratory and field measurements of the modification of radar backscatter by sandOver the last two decades, the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to address geologic problems has expanded as new applications for radar have been developed. One of the earliest and perhaps most surprising results from orbital SAR images of the Sahara was that, under certain conditions, radar signals penetrated up to several meters of sand to reveal subsurface features such as ancient river channels. Subsequent studies of radar penetration of arid sand deposits have dealt with factors that govern the ability of radar to penetrate a sand cover. This paper presents results from a laboratory experiment in which radar backscatter from a surface of rocks was measured under controlled conditions as a function of frequency, polarization, incidence angle, and sand cover thickness. The sand used in the experiment had a moisture content of 0.28 vol.% and caused calculated average attenuations of 4.2Â±1 dB/m for C-band and â¼11Â±2 dB/m for X-band. Results from the experiment were compared to field measurements of sand thickness during acquisition of airborne radar images. In AIRSAR images, the extent of dry sand in a dune field appears best in C-band because longer wavelength L- and P-band signals penetrate thinner sand deposits. Images of wet sand (4.9 vol.%) suggest that L-band was able to penetrate thin sand even though that sand was wet. Together, these laboratory and field measurements contribute towards a better understanding of how a sand cover modifies the radar backscatter of a surface.
