Tardigrades from Ecuador, with the Description of Two New Species: Mixibius ornatus n. sp. and Diphascon (Adropion) onorei n. sp. (Eutardigrada, Hypsibiidae)Seven species are reported from Ecuador, South America, two of which, Mixibius ornatus and Diphascon (Adropion) onorei, are new to science. Mixibius ornatus n. sp. differs from Mixibius saracenus (Pilato 1973) and from M. fueginus Pilato & Binda 1997 by having a sculptured cuticle, broader claws, lunulae present, stylet supports inserted on the buccal tube in a more caudal position, and shorter placoids. Diphascon (A.) onorei n. sp. has an elongate pharyngeal bulb with small apophyses, three rod-shaped macroplacoids, a granular microplacoid, and septulum; claw bases enlarged, smooth (first three pairs of legs) or crenate (outer claws on the hind legs); a cuticular bar is present near the inner claws on the first three pairs of legs. Other species reported are Echiniscus aliquantillus Grigarick, Schuster & Nelson 1983; Minibiotus intermedius (Plate 1888); Macrobiotus coronatus De Barros 1942; Macrobiotus danielae Pilato, Binda, Napolitano & Moncada 2001, and Astatumen bartosi Weglarska 1959.
