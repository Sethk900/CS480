Three new species of the genus Paramesochra T. Scott, 1892 (Copepoda: Harpacticoida: Paramesochridae) from Yellow Sea, Korea with a redescription of Paramesochra similis Kunz, 1936Three new species of Paramesochridae are described from the subtidal zone off Pungdo Island, west coast of Korea. Paramesochra parasimilis sp. nov. is closely related to Paramesochra similis. However, the new species is clearly distinguished by the characteristic seta IV of the caudal rami. Paramesochra pungdoensis sp. nov is characterized by five setae in antennary exopod and seta IV, which is longer than the caudal ramus. Paramesochra mirabilis sp. nov. has a laterally bent caudal seta V in the female. These three new species are placed in the dubia-group by the inner seta on the endopod of leg 3 and leg 4. Also, a redescription of Paramesochra similis Kunz, 1936 is provided, and an updated key to the species of Paramesochra is suggested. http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:F017D873-6A34-4976-A7EA-589038E1A9A3
