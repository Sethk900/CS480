ESTIMATION OF ROOT RESPIRATION RATE IN A MATURE FOREST ECOSYSTEMSoil respiration was measured throughout the year before and after clear-felling in a mature red pine (Pinus densiflora) forest in Hiroshima Prefecture, west Japan. The same environmental conditions as those before the felling such as light intensity, soil temperature and soil moisture content were maintained after the felling by using a frame box covered with sheets of black netting to observe soil respiration. The difference in soil respiration rates between pre- and post-felling was considered to roughly indicate the contributions of root respiration, because the root system of the pine dies and its respiration ceases after felling. Taking into consideration CO2 evolution due to the decomposition of roots which died as a result of the felling and the change of soil organic C flows after the felling, the proportion of root respiration rate in the soil respiration rate was estimated at 47-51% annually, which closely coincided with the value estimated indirectly by the cycle of soil C observed in primeval forests. This root respiration probably occupies about half of soil respiration in the mature forest ecosystem irrespective of the type of forest.
