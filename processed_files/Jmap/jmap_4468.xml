Spatial distribution of selected chemical properties of soils situated close to an abandoned manganese mineAbstract This study aimed at understanding the spatial distribution of the base saturation percentage (PSB), cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH(water) and electrical conductivity (EC) in soils situated close to the abandoned Kgwakgwe Mn oxide ore mine, Botswana. Four hundred soil samples were collected from a 4 km2 area close to the abandoned mine. Data obtained for these soils was processed using the statistical package for social science (SPSS), geographic information system (GIS), and Remote Sensing (RS) techniques with the integrated Land and Water Information System (ILWIS), Geosoft Oasis Montaj and ArcGIS software packages. Distribution patterns of the above parameters were complementary to one another.
