Future atmospheric CO2 leads to delayed autumnal senescence.Growing seasons are getting longer, a phenomenon partially explained by increasing global temperatures. Recent reports suggest that a strong correlation exists between warming and advances in spring phenology but that a weaker correlation is evident between warming and autumnal events implying that other factors may be influencing the timing of autumnal phenology. Using freely rooted, field-grown <em>Populus</em> in two Free Air CO<sub>2</sub> Enrichment Experiments (AspenFACE and PopFACE), we present evidence from two continents and over 2 years that increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> acts directly to delay autumnal leaf coloration and leaf fall. In an atmosphere enriched in CO<sub>2</sub> (by &sim;45% of the current atmospheric concentration to 550 ppm) the end of season decline in canopy normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) - a commonly used global index for vegetation greenness - was significantly delayed, indicating a greener autumnal canopy, relative to that in ambient CO<sub>2</sub>. This was supported by a significant delay in the decline of autumnal canopy leaf area index in elevated as compared with ambient CO<sub>2</sub>, and a significantly smaller decline in end of season leaf chlorophyll content. Leaf level photosynthetic activity and carbon uptake in elevated CO<sub>2</sub> during the senescence period was also enhanced compared with ambient CO<sub>2</sub>. The findings reveal a direct effect of rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, independent of temperature in delaying autumnal senescence for <em>Populus</em>, an important deciduous forest tree with implications for forest productivity and adaptation to a future high CO<sub>2</sub> world.
