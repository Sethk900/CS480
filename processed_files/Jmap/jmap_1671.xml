Reproductive phenology over a 10-year period in a lowland evergreen rain forest of central Borneo.<ol><li>The aim of this study was to document patterns in tree reproductive phenology in a rain forest of central Borneo and examine relationships between phenology and climatic patterns.</li><li>A 10-year data set (1990-2000) of monthly observations of flowering and fruit production of 171 trees (including 39 members of the Dipterocarpaceae) at Barito Ulu, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, showed that most trees (73%) underwent reproductive activity on a supra-annual timescale.</li><li>There were three general flowering (GF) events, in 1991, 1994 and 1997, which were preceded by major drought periods (30-day sliding total rainfall of less than 100 mm for more than 10 days) in which at least 40% of dipterocarps and at least 18% of all other trees underwent synchronized reproductive activity; there was also a minor event in 1990. Around 1.3% of trees flowered and 3.8% produced fruit in months outside of these four events.</li><li>At the community level, the strongest negative correlation was found between the percentage of flowering individuals and total rainfall in the preceding 150 days.</li><li>Within three genera of dipterocarps examined in more detail (<em>Dipterocarpus</em>, <em>Shorea</em> and <em>Vatica</em>) there were clear and consistent patterns of sequential flowering with certain species flowering early in the GF events and others towards the end of these events.</li><li>Our results confirm the importance of large-scale climatic fluctuations (El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation) on plant reproductive phenology in South-east Asian tropical forests and indicate that drought may be a more important cue than low night-time temperatures.</li></ol>
