Dietary variation and overlap in D’Orbigny’s slider turtles Trachemys dorbigni (Duméril and Bibron 1835) (Testudines: Emydidae)Although D’Orbigny’s slider (Trachemys dorbigni) is the most abundant freshwater chelonian species in southern Brazil, little is known about its feeding habits. Our goal was therefore to evaluate this species’ dietary composition and niche variation there. For this, we collected road-killed animals (n = 73) on a federal highway (BR 392) between 2002 and 2003, and analysed their gut contents. We identified 26 different dietary items, and our results indicated that D’Orbigny’s slider is omnivorous in this area. Total food volume, as well as the degree of herbivory and carnivory, were similar between males and females. However dietary composition of plants was different: although both males and females fed on underwater plant matter, only females consumed surface macrophytes. This finding suggested differential microhabitat usage between males and females throughout the swamps.
