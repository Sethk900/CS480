The spectrum-based learner: A new local approach for modeling soil vis–NIR spectra of complex datasetsThis paper shows that memory-based learning (MBL) is a very promising approach to deal with complex soil visible and near infrared (vis–NIR) datasets. The main goal of this work was to develop a suitable MBL approach for soil spectroscopy. Here we introduce the spectrum-based learner (SBL) which basically is equipped with an optimized principal components distance (oPC-M) and a Gaussian process regression. Furthermore, this approach combines local distance matrices and the spectral features as predictor variables. Our SBL was tested in two soil spectral libraries: a regional soil vis–NIR library of State of São Paulo (Brazil) and a global soil vis–NIR library. We calibrated models of clay content (CC), organic carbon (OC) and exchangeable Ca (Ca++). In order to compare the predictive performance of our SBL with other approaches, the following algorithms were used: partial least squares (PLS) regression, support vector regression machines (SVM), locally weighted PLS regression (LWR) and LOCAL. In all cases our SBL algorithm outperformed the accuracy of the remaining algorithms. Here we show that the SBL presents great potential for predicting soil attributes in large and diverse vis–NIR datasets. In addition we also show that soil vis–NIR distance matrices can be used to further improve the prediction performance of spectral models.
