A comparison of LiDAR-based DEMs and USGS-sourced DEMs in terrain analysis for knowledge-based digital soil mappingWhile LiDAR-based digital elevation models (DEM) are more accurate and precise than the USGS-sourced DEM that are widely used in soil mapping in the US, their high cost and other problems prohibit an easy decision of adopting them in service-oriented soil mapping conducted by a government agency like USDA-NRCS. This study compares the performances of LiDAR-based DEM and the USGS-sourced DEM in calculating slope gradient as an input for knowledge-based digital soil mapping (KBDSM), aiming to provide scientific evidence and more importantly, propose a scientific approach to evaluating the two types of DEM for KBDSM. We conducted the comparison by evaluating how closely the DEM-based slope gradient values match the field-measured values. For a small watershed in northern Vermont, US, we prepared three DEM, including a 10-m DEM interpolated from the 7.5-minute USGS topographic map, a 1-m DEM based on LiDAR points, and a 5-m DEM resampled from the 1-m DEM. When calculating slope gradient, we applied two neighborhood sizes (10 m and 30 m), two neighborhood shapes (square and circular), and three slope gradient algorithms (Evans–Young, Horn, and modified Zevenbergen–Thorne) to the three DEM. We then compared the calculated slope gradient values with the values measured by soil scientists at 159 sample locations in the study area. Statistics show that across all the tested settings, the LiDAR-based DEM perform significantly better than the USGS-sourced DEM. We conclude that LiDAR-based DEM may considerably improve the quality of inputs for KBDSM. We also find that the results from the 1-m LiDAR-based DEM and the resampled 5-m DEM do not show considerable and consistent differences.
