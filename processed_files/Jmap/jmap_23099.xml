Redescription and molecular characterization of Placobdella cryptobranchii (Johnson & Klemm, 1977) (Glossiphoniidae, Hirudinida)Abstract Placobdella cryptobranchii (Johnson & Klemm, 1977) was originally described from specimens collected from Ozark Hellbenders (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis bishopi) from the North Fork of the White River in Missouri, U.S.A. Leeches collected during August 2009 to August 2011 from five localities in Missouri (including the type locality) facilitated a redescription and molecular characterization of Placobdella cryptobranchii. Placobdella cryptobranchii has a rusty, reddish-brown dorsum with 2 lateral rows of unpigmented papillae, two unpigmented nuchal bands, unpigmented patches, and pair of four pre-anal papillae. Molecular comparison of CO-I sequence data from Placobdella cryptobranchii revealed a 93–94% similarity to Placobdella ornata and 10–17% difference among other species of Placobdella.
