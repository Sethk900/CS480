Diversity and abundance of frugivorous drosophilids and their parasitoids in Bogor, IndonesiaThe diversity, abundance and association of frugivorous drosophilids and their parasitoids were studied in Bogor, Indonesia (tropical region), and compared with the results in Iriomote-jima (subtropical region) and Tokyo (temperate region). Among the adult drosophilid flies collected in traps baited with banana in wooded areas, the number of commonly observed frugivorous drosophilid species (i.e. species that occupied more than 0.5% of total drosophilid samples) was 10 in Bogor and nine in Iriomote-jima, more than in Tokyo (six species), probably reflecting the high diversity and abundance of fruits. The rate of parasitism was very high in Bogor, especially in species of the Drosophila ananassae and immigrans species groups. The diversity of parasitoids attacking frugivorous drosophilids was higher in Bogor and Iriomote-jima than in Tokyo, possibly because of the high species diversity of host drosophilids. Parasitoids generally showed wider latitudinal distributions than drosophilids. No remarkable difference was observed in the host range among tropical, subtropical and temperate parasitoids.
