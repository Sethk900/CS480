Three species of Procyrnea Chabaud, 1958 (Nematoda: Habronematoidea: Habronematidae) from raptors in Beijing, China, with descriptions of two new speciesThree species of Procyrnea collected from raptors at the Beijing Raptor Rescue Centre, Beijing, China are described and illustrated by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Procyrnea beveridgei sp. nov. can be distinguished from related species in having symmetrical caudal alae, in the shape and length of the spicules, and in the shape of the gubernaculum. Procyrnea sinica sp. nov. is very similar to Procyrnea monoptera in having a barb on the distal end of the left spicule, but differs from the latter in the origin and length of lateral ala, and in the length of the left spicule. Procyrnea excisiformis (Yamaguti, 1935) is redescribed. The general morphology of our specimens is in agreement with the original description. However, two barbs on the distal end of the left spicule were observed in the present study whereas just one barb was described in the original description.
