Cavitation Potential of Flow on Stepped SpillwaysAbstractCavitation on spillways has proven to be an undesirable condition. The formation of vapor-filled bubbles and cavities and their eminent collapse has led to significant damage to major spillway components and appurtenant structures worldwide. Although stepped spillways are thought to be less prone to cavitation damage than smooth spillways, designers continue conservative practices regarding specifying stepped spillways at many sites. Using laboratory experiments in a specialized reduced ambient pressure chamber, cavitation was shown to form on stepped geometries that are representative of typical stepped spillways currently in service. Experiments in a nonaerated closed conduit revealed the strength and extents of the highly intense shear layer that forms above the step tips, and the friction characteristics were determined and compared with results from previous researchers. Advanced techniques for detecting cavitation characteristics along with high-speed videography have given additional insight into the flow features that drive the formation of cavitation. Finally, a correlation between the critical cavitation index and the common friction factor is shown, extending the data that also includes shear layers resulting from uniformly distributed roughnesses, jets, and wakes.
