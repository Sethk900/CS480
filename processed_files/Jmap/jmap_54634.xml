Variations in chemical composition of the soil solution over a four-year period at an upland site in southwest ScotlandSoil solution chemical composition was monitored over a period of almost four years in a peaty soil in the Loch Dee catchment, southwest Scotland. Solutions were acidic with mean pH of 4.2 in the surface 20 cm and of 4.7 at 60 cm. The increase in pH was associated with increased Ca concentrations but no increase in Al. Annual cycles in solution concentrations were identified, with winter peaks in Cl, Na and Mg, and a late summer peak in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and Fe. Variations in DOC were related to temperature and rewetting of dry soil. Maximum DOC and Fe followed the drought summer of 1984 with concentrations of 60 and 13 mg 1âˆ’1 respectively at one sampler. Variations in Al concentrations were partly related to DOC and partly to pH. Inorganic monomeric forms of Al were predominant. DOC also contributed significantly to the overall ionic balance.
