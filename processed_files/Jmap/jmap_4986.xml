Temporal organization patterns of epigean beetle communities (Coleoptera: Carabidae, Tenebrionidae) in different successional stages of eastern Mediterranean maquisThis two-year study explores the community structure and temporal dynamics of carabid and tenebrionid beetles in five eastern Mediterranean juniper maquis formations in relation to successional stage. Based on vegetation cover, density and soil pH, the successional stage in two of the sites (Crete, Cyprus) was an earlier state compared with the other three (Attiki, Naxos, Samos), as a result of intense goat grazing. Diversity indices and abundance distributions were compared using morphoecological surrogates of the taxa. Temporal dynamics were regulated more by cumulative species richness than by sharp phenological patterns. The higher values of niche pre-emption parameter and species turnover imply better adaptation of endemic tenebrionids to the rapid change of environmental conditions, compared with carabids. Significantly lower abundance and biomass, and higher evenness and temporal turnover for both families in Crete and Cyprus are ascribed to the reversed course of succession caused by overgrazing.
