Variaciones temporales y distribución horizontal del zooplancton en algunos cauces secundarios del rio Paraná MedioAbstract The object of this work was to determine the principal characteristics of the Zooplankton of several secondary rivers of the Middle Paraná River. Special emphasis was given to the influence of the most important physical factors relation to the hydrologic cycle. Transparency, depth, pH, temperature, and speed stream data were obtained in the field. Data on hydrometric level and discharge of the Santa Fe and Correntoso rivers were also available. A summary of physical and chemical data is shown. With respect to the Zooplankton the following aspects were analyzed: density; biomass; specific diversity; equitability, faunistic distance.
