Mineralogical comparison of agriculturally acidified and naturally acidic soilsSoil acidification and accelerated mineral weathering as a result of N fertilization may result in a soil solution silica activity that favors the formation of short-range-order aluminosilicates, thereby sequestering Al. Furthermore, soils formed in alluviums of differing lithology may partition Al3+ into different pools. We hypothesized that parent material silica content controls solution silica concentrations and short-range-order aluminosilicate formation, thereby controlling solution Al3+ activity. As a result, we expected mineralogy to follow alteration pathways toward the minerals found in weathered naturally acidic (acidic) soils. To test this hypothesis, we compared the mineral assemblages in nonacidified (NA), agriculturally acidified (AA) and acidic soils formed in sialic, mafic, and mixed alluvium. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the clay fraction bulk mineralogy of AA soils is similar to their NA counterparts, but in every case, clay activity, as measured by CEC/clay, was reduced by the acidification process, a trend consistent with mineral alteration trajectories toward the acidic, weathered soils. A combination of selective dissolution and CEC measurements suggested that precipitation of short-range-order hydroxy-Al and aluminosilicates were the dominant mechanisms that control solution Al. In the AA soil derived from sialic parent material, hydroxy-Al was the largest Al pool. In the agriculturally acidified soil derived from mafic parent materials, the short-range-order aluminosilicate fraction was the dominant Al pool. Aluminum sinks in AA soils with mixed lithology were dominated by hydroxy-Al and exchangeable Al. We speculate that â€œfreeâ€ (noninterlayer) hydroxy-Al may be a significant Al sink in the AA soils. Our results suggest that short-range-order aluminosilicates play some role in controlling soil solution Al activity, but the higher silica content of the parent material did not correlate directly with increased abundance of short-range-order aluminosilicate compounds in acidified soils. This research on soil acidification provides new information on how ammonium fertilization affects the chemical aspects of soil quality, in particular, the partitioning of Al to solid phases that may not be in equilibrium with the bulk clay mineralogy.
