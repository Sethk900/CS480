An updating of the genus Leprolochus (Araneae: Zodariidae)The type specimens and all available material of the species belonging to the spider genus Leprolochus Simon were examined. The taxonomic position of this genus is discussed briefly, and data concerning its natural history are reviewed. Three species appear to belong to the genus, i.e. L. spinifrons Simon (L decorants Chickering is a junior synomym), the type species, L parahybae Mello‚ÄLeit√£o, and L birabeni Mello‚ÄLeit√£o. The latter species is very widespread with an area of distribution ranging from northern Brazil to central Argentine. L parahybae is known only from the type locality Campina Grande in Brazil, whereas L spinifrons occurs in a restricted range along coastal regions of Central and northern South America.
