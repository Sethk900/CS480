Systematics of Mabuya frenata cochabambae Dunn, 1935 (Reptilia, Sauria, Scincidae) from Inner-Andean Dry Valleys of BoliviaA combined analysis of 523 bp and 402 bp sequences of the mitochondrial 16S and 12S rRNA genes, respectively, suggests Mabuya frenata cochabambae being regarded a full species, M. cochabambae Dunn, 1935. It is phylogenetically closely related to M. dorsivittata rather than to M. frenata. Mabuya cochabambae is only known from inner-Andean dry valleys of central Bolivia, Departments Cochabamba and Santa Cruz, at elevations of 1300â€“3800m above sea level.
