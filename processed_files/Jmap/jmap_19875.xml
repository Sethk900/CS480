Retrofitting Gallinaceous Guzzlers to Enhance Water Availability and Safety for WildlifeThousands of wildlife water developments, commonly known as gallinaceous guzzlers or guzzlers, have been installed throughout the western United States. In general, these units collect runoff from a concrete or other impervious surface and store that water in underground tanks. Water availability is limited to wildlife able to enter a small opening (approx. 20 cm in height) and crawl or walk down a sloped surface to the level of stored water. This design precludes use by large mammals. Moreover, wildlife occasionally may become entrapped in storage tanks, potentially fouling stored water. We developed a method of modifying gallinaceous guzzlers that allows large animals to access stored water and simultaneously decreases the probability of wildlife becoming entrapped in those guzzlers.
