Seed germination of five mountain steppe species of Central Asia.This paper presents data on the germination traits of five perennials (Allium polyrrhizum, Agropyron cristatum, Arenaria meyeri, Artemisia frigida and Artemisia santolinifolia) widespread in the mountain steppes of southern Mongolia. Germination and seed viability were assessed at three alternate temperatures (8/4 °C, 20/10 °C, 32/20 °C), three levels of osmotic stress (deionized water; -;0.5 MPa, -;1 MPa Mannitol solution), and under conditions of alternate light/darkness versus complete darkness. The results of a factorial ANOVA with treatments and species as main effects showed that all five species germinated best at higher temperatures, with only Agropyron cristatum showing some seed mortality. Osmotic stress reduced seed viability and total germination in all five species. Darkness had no influence on viability, but positively affected seed germination of Allium polyrrhizum and Agropyron cristatum. We therefore conclude that, in the field, germination of all five species is mainly controlled by ambient temperatures and water availability, both of which drop towards the end of summer when dispersal takes place and effectively delay seedling recruitment until the next vegetation period.
