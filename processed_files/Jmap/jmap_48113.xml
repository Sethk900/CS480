Description of the biology and immature stages of Pagyris ulla (Hewitson) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Ithomiini) in the Colombian AndesThe biology and immature stages of Pagyris ulla (Hewitson, [1857]) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Ithomiini) are described for the first time. The speciesâ€™ host plant is established to be Brugmansia candida Pers. (Solanaceae). The life cycle from eggs to adult under laboratory conditions and ambient temperature took approximately 47 days, and the larvae passed through five instars. The larvae are gregarious, feed at night, and rest during the day in nests made by joining leaves near the apex of the plant stem.
