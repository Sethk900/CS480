Two new species of Stenochironomus Kieffer (Diptera, Chironomidae) from Zhejiang, ChinaTwo new species of Stenochironomus Kieffer (Diptera: Chironomidae: Chironominae), S. brevissimus sp. n. and S. linanensis sp. n., are described from China and the male imagines are illustrated. S. brevissimus sp. n. can be separated from the so far known species by having very short and small, spatulate superior volsella with two long setae, whereas S. linanensis sp. n. is easily separated from the other species of Stenochironomus by the following characters: wings transparent, body yellow, superior volsella finger-like, with nine long setae, elongated inferior volsella with four long setae and one well developed terminal spine; tergite IX with 10âˆ’15 long setae medially. A key to the males of Stenochironomus occurring in China is given.
