Taxonomic revision of some lepraliomorph cheilostome bryozoans (Bryozoa: Lepraliomorpha) from Rio de Janeiro State, BrazilLepraliomorph-grade ascophorans are the dominant group of bryozoans in most modern faunas. Here we describe five new species (Parasmittina alba sp. nov., Microporella proxima sp. nov., Reteporella antennata sp. nov., Stephanollona robustaspinosa sp. nov. and Turritigera buski sp. nov.) and record an additional five lepraliomorph species [Watersipora subovoidea (d'Orbigny, 1852), Schizoporella errata (Waters, 1878), Arthropoma cecilii (Audouin, 1826), Celleporina diota (Marcus, 1938) and Reteporellina evelinae Marcus, 1955] from the coastal waters off Rio de Janeiro State in Brazil. This increases the biodiversity of the bryozoan fauna from Brazil, and the number of species known from Rio de Janeiro State now totals 79.
