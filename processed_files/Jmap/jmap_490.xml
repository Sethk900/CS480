Large-Scale Zostera marina (eelgrass) Restoration in Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, USA. Part I: A Comparison of Techniques and Associated Costs.The Chesapeake Bay, like many other temperate estuaries, has exhibited dramatic declines in the abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) during the later half of the twentieth century. Because of the functions SAV serve in maintaining a healthy estuarine ecosystem, SAV restoration has become an important component of Chesapeake Bay restoration. Specifically, recent water quality improvements in areas from which populations of <em>Zostera marina</em> (eelgrass) have been extirpated have suggested that <em>Z. marina</em> restoration could succeed. Early restoration efforts involved transplanting <em>Z. marina</em> plants from healthy source beds to restoration locations, but this was labor intensive, time consuming, expensive, and potentially detrimental to donor beds. This multi-year project investigated new techniques for large-scale <em>Z. marina</em> seed collection and processing and compared two seed dispersal methods to evaluate cost effectiveness. Tens of millions of mature <em>Z. marina</em> seeds were collected through snorkeling, SCUBA, or with a mechanical harvester. Seed storage conditions and processing techniques were manipulated in order to maximize seed yield. Seeds were dispersed using two methods: spring seed buoys and fall seed broadcasts. Our costs for planting 1 ha of bottom with <em>Z. marina</em> seeds ranged from $6,674 to $165,699 depending on seeding density and dispersal method used. The average cost per <em>Z. marina</em> seed was $0.17. Interannual variations in seed collection yield and seed viability after summer storage had great impact on final costs. Our results suggest that the use of seeds for large-scale <em>Z. marina</em> restoration offers a competitive advantage to more traditional transplanting methods.
