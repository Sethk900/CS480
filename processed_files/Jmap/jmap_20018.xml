Effect of the droplet activation process on microphysical properties of warm cloudsThis study investigates the effect of the droplet activation process on microphysical characteristics of warm clouds represented by correlation statistics between cloud droplet effective radius re and cloud optical thickness τc. The conceptual adiabatic model is first employed to interpret satellite-observed re–τc correlation statistics over two different regions and to reveal distinctively different increasing patterns of droplet number concentration between these regions. This difference is attributed to a different behavior of the droplet activation process induced by differing microphysical conditions of aerosols. Numerical experiments of changing aerosol size spectrum are then performed with a spectral bin microphysics cloud model. The results show that the slope of the size spectrum controls the re–τc relationship through its effect on increasing pattern of droplet number concentration due to the activation process. The simulated results are also found to reproduce the re–τc correlation statistics closely resembling those observed when the slope parameter and the aerosol amount are appropriately chosen. These results suggest that the re–τc correlation statistics observed by remote sensing studies contains a signature of how the droplet activation process takes place in the real clouds.
