Identification and Classification of Restoration Interdependencies in the Wake of Hurricane SandyAbstractThis paper introduces the new concept of restoration interdependencies that exist among infrastructures during their restoration efforts after an extreme event. Restoration interdependencies occur whenever a restoration task in one infrastructure is impacted by a restoration task, or lack thereof, in another infrastructure. This work identifies examples of observed restoration interdependencies during the restoration efforts after Hurricane Sandy as reported by major newspapers in the affected areas. A classification scheme for the observed restoration interdependencies is provided that includes five distinct classes: traditional precedence, effectiveness precedence, options precedence, time-sensitive options, and competition for resources. This work provides an overview of these different classes by providing the frequency they were observed, the infrastructures involved with the restoration interdependency, and a discussion of their potential impact on interdependent infrastructure restoration. The analysis is important because it provides a new understanding of how the restoration efforts of infrastructures are linked across systems and motivates the need for potential information-sharing in interdependent infrastructure restoration.
