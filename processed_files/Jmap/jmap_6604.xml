Reciprocal differences in intraspecies crosses of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.)Reciprocal differences in a diallel cross experiment with air-cured tobacco strains were found to be significant for certain characteristics, but relatively small compared to differences between strains in general combining ability. A factorial analysis designed to detect maternal effects in the same material failed to substantiate significance for these characteristics. A separate experiment with flue-cured tobacco strains involving genome transfer by backcrossing, gave no indication of a cytoplasmic contribution to variation in the characteristics measured.
