The distribution of the vascular plants on the North Frisian Island, AmrumAbstract Amrum is a small barrier island on the north-west coast of Germany. The distribution of vascular plants was examined by surveying their 1km2 grid square occupancy across the whole island. These data were used in a study on the recent vegetation change in the island. These data include 3786 observations of 450 taxa collected in two surveys in 2007 and 2008.
