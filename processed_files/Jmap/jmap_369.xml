Factors Affecting Landscape Occupancy by Fishers in North-Central British Columbia.To better understand distribution and density of fishers (<em>Martes pennanti</em>) in industrial forests of north-central British Columbia, Canada, we examined factors affecting the probability of a potential home range being occupied by 10 radiotagged resident fishers in the Sub-Boreal Spruce biogeoclimatic zone between 1996 and 2000. Percentage of a home range in wetlands and recently logged (within past 12Â yr) best predicted likelihood of occupancy by each fisher. Probability of a home range area being occupied by a resident fisher decreased with increasing amounts of wetlands and recent logging present in the area. We estimated that a 5% increase in wetlands or recent logging decreased the relative probability of occupancy of a potential home range by 50%. The accelerated rate of timber harvest in forests affected by mountain pine beetle (<em>Dendroctonus ponderosae</em>) infestations may have substantial implications for the ability of the landscape of central British Columbia to support sustainable populations of fishers.
