FLOWERS ARE PRODUCED ON STEMS SHORTER THAN ONE METER IN THE DESERT SHRUB OCOTILLO (FOUQUIERIA SPLENDENS)The minimum of stem required for production of flowers in the C(3) desert shrub ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens) has been widely accepted as I in since 1943. Long-term studies in the Chihuahuan Desert. indicate that this threshold is no longer acceptable. During 2003-2006, 15 ocotillo Steins shorter than 1 m produced 1-32 flowers each. The shortest. stein oil which flowers were produced was 62 cm long. Although fully capable of producing flowers, the contribution of stems <1 m long to overall production of flowers was small, accounting For only 0.49% of all flower-bearing stems. Stems <1 m long, can no longer be excluded from studies of allocation to reproduction in ocotillo because of their assumed inability to produce flowers.
