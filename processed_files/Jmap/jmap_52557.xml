The genus is characterized by the lateral margin of the clypeus projecting as subtriangular lobe; lateral lobes of fourth tarsomeres distinctly longer than mesal lobes; fore wing vein 3r-m absent; hind wing vein 2-1A absent or vestigial; and first metasomal tergite with a basolateral tooth. It occurs from Mexico to southern Brazil. Nine species are recognized, of which six are described as new: L. dodecius Santos et Aguiar, L. duckei Santos et Aguiar, L. exius Santos et Aguiar, L. ichilus Santos et Aguiar, L. tenuis Santos et Aguiar, and L. venezuelanus Santos et Aguiar. The type species, L. australis Townes, and L. multicolor Kasparyan et Ruíz-Cancino are redescribed, and a diagnosis is provided for L. unicolor Kasparyan et Ruíz-Cancino, not examined. All studied species are illustrated and distribution records are mapped. An identification key for the species of Loxopus is presented.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:5B73E8B4-1288-4FD9-AABD-845B5085FFE3
