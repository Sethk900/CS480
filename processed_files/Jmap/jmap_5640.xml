On three new species of Mesochra Boeck, 1865 (Harpacticoida: Canthocamptidae) from IcelandThree new species of Mesochra Boeck, 1865, were found during two surveys in southâ€western Iceland of the feeding ecology of juvenile lumpsucker Cyclopterus lumpus Linnaeus, 1758, in floating seaweed and the seasonality of harpacticoids in a low intertidal pool. Only two species of the genus, M. lilljeborgi Boeck, 1864 and M. rapiens (Schmeil, 1894), have been found in previous studies in Iceland. The three new species, Mesochra ingolfssoni sp. nov., Mesochra snoppa sp. nov., and Mesochra freyri sp. nov. resemble M. stellfeldi Jakobi, 1954 in the normal (not dwarfed) outer seta of both male and female P5 EXP, but differ in that M. stellfeldi possesses unequal inner baseoendopodal setae on the female P5. The three new species resemble M. pygmaea (Claus, 1863) in the equal inner baseoendopodal setae of the female P5, but differ in the dwarfed outer seta of the male and female P5 EXP present in M. pygmaea, and can be easily separated by shape of the rostrum, female P6, number of pinnate elements on the second antennular segment, general shape of the antenna and shape of the lateral and distal inner spines, among other character states.
