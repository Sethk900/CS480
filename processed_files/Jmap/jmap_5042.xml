Ptycholaimellus ocellatus sp. nov. is characterized by the presence of ocelli, an abruptly narrowing anterior cervical region, a cuticle with transverse rows of punctations, a lateral differentiation with two longitudinal rows of thick elongate dots, and voluminous ventral gland with a large ampulla. Prochromadorella gracila sp. nov. is characterized by the combination of lateral differentiations in the anterior pharyngeal region, a small conical stoma with outstretched teeth, slit-like amphidial fovea, and five pre-cloacal supplements.
