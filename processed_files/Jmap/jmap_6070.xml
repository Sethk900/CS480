Effect of zinc carrier on mobilisation of foliar-applied zinc above and below the point of application in ‘Kakamas’ peach seedlingsIn a pot trial using coarse sand as a potting medium and modified (low zinc) Hoagland solution as a nutrient source, single mid-shoot leaves of mildly zinc deficient ‘Kakamas’ peach seedlings were periodically dipped into aqueous solutions, prepared at 20 times the normal spray concentration, of the zinc carriers zinc oxide, Zinc Metalosate and Zincmax, and of the zinc-containing fungicides Dithane M-45 and Polyram. Relative to the control (water), Dithane M-45 and Polyram significantly (p > 0.05) increased the levels of zinc in the tissues of the shoot, both above and below the dipped leaf. Dithane M-45 also increased the shoot manganese levels. Increases in tissue zinc levels were not related to the concentrations of zinc in the dip solutions.
