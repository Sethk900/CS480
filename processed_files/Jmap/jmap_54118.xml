Quantitative relationships between morphology and current soil hydrology in some Alfisols in semiarid tropical AustraliaThe shallow groundwater hydrology of a sequence of red, yellow, and grey earths (Paleustalfs, Plinthustalfs and Ochraqualfs of â€œSoil Taxonomyâ€) was monitored over a 9-year period (1973â€“1982) along a drilled transect of 30 boreholes near Torrens Creek, in northeastern Australia. Climatic analysis shows an aridic soil moisture regime under which soil water surpluses should not occur, and thus significant hydromorphism would not be expected in the soils. The present study has demonstrated, however, that profile saturation and groundwater tables may be expected to develop at various depths in the soils as often as 1 year in 3. Besides, strong linear relationships were found between a number of morphological features of the soils and various hydrological regimes currently active in the profiles: the depths to the upper limits of brown, brownish red, or red mottles, to the upper limit of ironstone gravels, and to the maximum content of clay are all most closely related to the mean position of the shallowest water tables observed; the depths to grey mottles and to mottles with chromas of two or less are most directly related to the depths at which the soils are saturated for 5 weeks; the depth to the maximum content of ironstone gravels and to the base of the solum are most closely associated with the depth at which the soils are saturated for 10 to 15 weeks; and dominantly grey colours in the strongly mottled subsols are best related to profile saturations for at least 21 weeks. The results indicate that the gley features present in the soil profiles could have developed, at least in part, in response to the current soil hydrological regime.
