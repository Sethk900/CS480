Temporal changes in burrow structure of the thalassinidean ghost shrimps Trypaea australiensis and Biffarius arenosusThe thalassinidean ghost shrimps Trypaea australiensis and Biffarius arenosus are dominant burrowing macroinvertebrates of softâ€sediment habitats in Western Port, Victoria, Australia. Burrow structure has been described for both species but little is known about how the burrows change over time. This study used resin casting to investigate temporal variation by making burrow casts each month over a 12â€month period. It was found that the overall burrow morphology of both T. australiensis and B. arenosus was consistent over time, but in the warmer months (summer and spring), both species constructed burrows that were deeper and of greater volume than burrows constructed in winter and autumn. Possible reasons for this variation are discussed.
