Studies of the genus Enchodelus Thorne, 1939 (Nematoda, Nordiidae) from Arctic polar deserts. 1. Species with long odontostyle: E. makarovae sp. n. and E. groenlandicus (Ditlevsen, 1927) Thorne, 1939, with an identification key to the species of the E. macrodorus groupAbstract Two nematode species of the genus Enchodelus Thorne, 1939, one new and one known from Arctic polar deserts were studied. Enchodelus makarovae sp. n. is an amphimictic species, characterised by females with body length of 1.57–2.00 mm, lip region 15–17.5 µm wide, amphid duplex, odontostyle 38–43 µm long or 2.3–2.8 times lip region diam. Odontophore with flanges, 1.2–1.4 times as long as odontostyle; pharynx length 320–377 µm, pharyngeal expansion 113–130 µm long or 32–37% of total pharynx length; female genital system amphidelphic, uterus tripartite, pars refringens vaginae with two trapezoid sclerotisations, vulva a transverse slit (V=45–51%); tail bluntly conoid (25–35 µm, c=45.8–70.3, c’=0.6–0.9 in females, and 29–33 µm, c=46.4–58.9, c’=0.7–0.8 in males). Males with 65–74 µm long spicules and 10–12 spaced ventromedian supplements. Additional information for Enchodelus groenlandicus is provided, this being a new geographic record for the Putorana Plateau, Russian Arctic.
