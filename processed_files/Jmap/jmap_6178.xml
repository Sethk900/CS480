Development of integrated control strategies for wattle. 1. Utilization of wattle, control of stumps and rehabilitation with pasturesTwo integrated control strategies were developed for areas where wattle infestations could be utilized. Costing analyses were determined for initial control and four follow-up control operations using chemical control and fire. Efficacy of all treatments was high. Costs were significantly reduced during follow-up control operations. Rehabilitation of the cleared areas with pasture species stabilized the top soil and increased the carrying capacity of the land. The pastures could be maintained or allowed to revert to neighbouring veld (grassland) species, depending on the aims of the land manager. The financial returns from conversion of wattle infestations to pastures required 1 or 7 years utilization (grazing) to cover the costs of control, depending on the production system used. Control costs of these trials were compared with contract-based costs at the Kouga Work for Water project in the Eastern Cape.
