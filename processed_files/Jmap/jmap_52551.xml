Comparison of the species composition of Gamasina mite communities (Acari: Mesostigmata) in selected caves of the Kraków-Częstochowa Upland (southern Poland) and their immediate surroundingsThis paper presents the results of a study performed in eight caves located in the area of the Kraków-Częstochowa Upland. In total, 586 samples (400 cm3 each) were taken from the caves and sites located up to one metre from the main entrances of the caves. Of 109 species belonging to 13 families that were identified, four were species new for Polish fauna. In this study, cluster analysis and correspondence analysis were used to compare the species composition of mite communities living in the caves and their immediate surroundings. We also examined the possibility of isolating troglophilic species based on IndVal analysis. Those results showed distinct differences between Gamasina mites living in two distinct habitats. We also established indicator species for the examined caves.
