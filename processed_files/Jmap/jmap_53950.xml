Clay mineral distribution in two toposequences of tropical soils of IndiaThe clay fractions of the soils of two toposequences derived from gneissic rocks (Peninsular gneiss) in southern India consist chiefly of kaolinite and amorphous ferrialuminosilicates (AFAS). The cation exchange capacity of the amorphous constituents, ranging between 21.4 and 107.6 mequiv./100 g, has been explained on the basis of a structural model. Considerable amounts of smectite were present in the clays of soils on the toeslopes. Two hypothetical pathways for the formation of the clay minerals are proposed.
