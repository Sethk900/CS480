Aenictus yangi sp. n. â€“ a new species of the A. ceylonicus species group (Hymenoptera, Formicidae, Dorylinae) from Yunnan, ChinaIn this study we present a taxonomic update for the Aenictus ceylonicus group. A recent survey of the leaf litter ant fauna of Xingshuangbanna (Yunnan, China) yielded material of a hitherto unknown member of the group, which we describe here as Aenictus yangi sp. n. The new species is clearly distinguishable from the other species of the A. ceylonicus group based on differences in mandibular dentition, the development of the metanotal groove, the shape of the propodeum and subpetiolar process, as well as surface sculpture on the mesosoma and waist segments. In order to integrate A. yangi sp. n. into the taxonomic system created by Jaitrong and Yamane (2013) we provide an update to the identification key provided in the latter revision, as well as a diagnostic discussion and high-quality illustrations of important species and morphological characters.
