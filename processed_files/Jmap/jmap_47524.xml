Trophic interactions between the fish Geophagus brasiliensis (Cichlidae) and the benthic macroinvertebrate communityThe aim of this study was to analyze the trophic interactions between the population of the native fish Geophagus brasiliensis and the benthic macroinvertebrate community in the Broa Reservoir, SÃ£o Paulo State, Brazil. The data obtained showed that the macroinvertebrates are used frequently as a source of food by the G. brasiliensis population, but that plant remains and fish eggs are also present in high amounts, thus characterizing this species, in this water body, as omnivorous for feeding habit and benthivorous for feeding behavior. In its feeding pattern, this species showed high selectivity for dipteran larvae of the family Chironomidae.
