Key constraints and problems affecting the inland fishery value chain in central MexicoAnthropogenic activities have been the major cause of watershed deterioration in many parts of the world, negatively impacting inland fisheries. In Mexico, freshwater fishing represents a source of protein, income, and employment for rural communities; however, in the national fisheries statistics they only account for 3% of the total production, and increases have not taken place since the 1990s. Demand is higher than supply because the national market can only provide 50% of consumption, and these fisheries are currently passing through a complex situation that prevents an increase in production levels and fishers’ incomes. This study examined the main production constraints and problems that prevent production from increasing to satisfy national demand. We considered value chain analysis and fish catch dynamic approaches. Fieldwork was conducted in 2 periods during 2011 and 2012 in 4 riparian communities near Lake Chapala and Lake Yuriria. The methodological approach considered socioeconomic factors and temporal variability of catch volume in both lakes. Results showed that production constraints are the result of watershed and fisheries mismanagement. Catch levels were strongly related to the environmental conditions of the lakes, which have shown instability and decline that affect fishers’ livelihoods. In addition, illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing and the ineffectiveness of institutions to rule the actions of all actors who intervene in the management and use of these resources allow destructive strategies toward the fisheries. Finally, inland fisheries management is not considered part of watershed management policies, resulting in ill-adapted water allocation policies that affect fisheries production levels.
