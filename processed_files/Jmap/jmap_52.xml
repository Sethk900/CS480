Lemmas and endosperms significantly inhibited germination of Leymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzvel. (Poaceae).The mechanism of seed dormancy in Leymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzvel. has not been fully understood. In particular, the role of mechanical resistance offered by glumes remains unclear, and this study sought to investigate that role. Glumes (including lemmas and paleas) and endosperms were removed partly or fully and the effect of so treating the seeds on germination was assessed. Germination was significantly higher (95%) in seeds in which the lemmas had been removed than that observed in intact seeds (72%) but was not significantly different from that in seeds from which the glumes had been removed. These results show that lemmas and not paleas play a critical role in germination of L. chinensis. There was no significant difference in germination percentage between the treatments in which the glumes were removed and that in which the glumes were removed and put back again in their original position. The endosperm also significantly influenced germination: seeds in which a quarter or a half of the endosperm had been removed recorded almost 100% germination. Dormancy in L. chinensis thus appears to be controlled by the lemma and the endosperm.
