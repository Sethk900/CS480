Nest return times in response to static versus mobile human disturbance.We delivered standardized stimuli to incubating hooded plovers (<em>Thinornis rubricollis</em>) to examine the influence of human movement on disruption of incubation. The probability of plovers returning to nests within 60min was higher in our treatment that mimicked mobile (e.g., walking) humans (85.7%) than in our treatment that mimicked static (e.g., sunbathing) humans (9.5%; <em>n</em>=20 pairs). Thus, temporary beach closures that reduce or eliminate static but not mobile disturbances are likely to be effective at reducing disruption to incubation caused by human disturbance.
