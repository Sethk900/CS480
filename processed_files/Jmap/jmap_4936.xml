Habitat selection by small mammals in Brazilian Pampas biomeThe use of microhabitats by small mammals was investigated in an area of Pampas in southern Brazil. We used 10 transect lines with 12 live-traps during six fieldwork sessions between June 2009 and April 2010. Sixteen environmental variables measured were summarized by a principal component analysis (PCA). Richness, total abundance and abundance of each species captured were correlated with the first two PCA axes. The environmental variables were also correlated with the small-mammal abundance through a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The first axis was related to variables that characterize forest environments, such as canopy cover and number of trees, and the second axis (with which the species richness and abundance were associated) was related to water, arthropods and herbaceous vegetation. The CCA and PCA showed a significant effect of microhabitat variables on species occurrence. In view of the great variability of environments in the study area and the correlation of the species with the environment variables measured, the degree of heterogeneity seemed to be an important factor associated with the small-mammal variation among microhabitats.
