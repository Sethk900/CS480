Watershed assessment along a segment of the Rio Conchos in northern Mexico using satellite imagesSatellite images were used to illustrate the usefulness of such data in evaluating the ecological impacts of precipitation and land use on selected segments of the lower Rio Conchos in northern Mexico. Variations in the size and turbidity of impounded reservoirs, riparian vegetation, soil salinity and land use within the Rio Conchos basin were analysed using four Landsat TM images over a period of 10 years. A variety of image enhancements were applied to determine subtle changes between the images. These, when combined with precipitation and historical land-use data as well as one time water quality and soil EC, provided useful interpretation of the images, and therefore, in the monitoring of the basin.
