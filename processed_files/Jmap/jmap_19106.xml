Management effects on soil CO2 efflux in northern semiarid grassland and croplandSoil respiration is a process influenced by land use, management practices, and environmental conditions. Our objectives were to evaluate relationships between management-induced differences in soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil CO2 efflux from continuous no-till spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), spring wheat-fallow under no-till, and a native mixed-grass prairie with grazing near Mandan, ND. A Wemer-Sen-Chama soil complex (Entic Haplustoll, Typic Haplustoll, and Typic Calciustoll) was present at the grassland site and a Wilton silt loam (Pachic Haplustoll) at the cropping sites. Soil chambers were used to measure Soil CO2 effluxes about every 21 days starting 14 May 2001 to 1 April 2003. Soil water and soil temperature were measured at time of CO2 efflux measurements. Soil organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and above and belowground plant biomass were measured in mid-July each year. Root biomass to 0.3 m depth of the undisturbed grassland was significantly greater (12.3 Mg ha(-1)) than under continuous wheat (1.3 Mg ha-1) and wheat-fallow (0.3 Mg ha(-1)). Grassland SOC content of 84 Mg ha(-1) to 0.3 m soil depth was 1.2 times greater than continuous wheat and 1.3 times greater than wheat-fallow. The MBC of the grassland was 2.2 Mg ha(-1), or 3.6 times greater than continuous wheat and 7.2 times greater than wheat-fallow treatments. Soil CO2 efflux averaged 2.8 g CO2-C m(-2) day(-1) for grassland, compared to 1-9 9 CO2-C m(-2) day(-1) for wheat fallow and 1.6 g CO2-C m(-2) day(-1) for continuous wheat treatments. Although these CO, efflux rates were based on measurements made at intervals of about 21 days, the differences among treatments with time were rather consistent. Differences in Soil CO2 efflux among treatments could be attributed to differences in SOC and MBC, suggesting that land use plays a significant role in soil CO2 efflux from respiration.
