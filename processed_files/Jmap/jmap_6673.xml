The effect of reduced tillage on soil organic carbonThe organic carbon contents of the 0–15-cm and 15–30-cm layers of conventionally tilled, stubble-mulched and no-tilled soils were compared. Samples from four localities in the Transvaal and Orange Free State were analyzed for organic C by means of two methods. Only in one case did stubble-mulch tillage unquestionably result in an increase (38%) in organic C content of the top layer, when compared with conventional tillage. It is suggested that sampling times, sampling depths and number of samples taken, receive greater attention in future studies.
