Nutritive Quality of Highbush Blackberry (Rubus argutus) Exposed to Tropospheric Ozone.Numerous studies have examined the impacts of ground level O<sub>3</sub> on plants that are important for human consumption, but native species that are important for wildlife have received less scrutiny. During May-August 2004 we examined the effects of O<sub>3</sub> on biomass production and nutritive quality of highbush blackberry (<em>Rubus argutus</em> Link), an important forage for white-tailed deer (<em>Odocoileus virginianus</em> Zimmerman) and other herbivorous mammals. Plants were fumigated in open-top chambers with three levels of O<sub>3</sub> in a randomized-block experiment with three replicates of each treatment. Our three experimental treatments were carbon-filtered air, characteristic of clean air quality; nonfiltered air, representative of air quality in Auburn, AL; and air with double (2Ã—) the ambient concentration of O<sub>3</sub>. Although biomass production was not influenced by O<sub>3</sub> exposure, nutritive quality of plants was associated negatively with O<sub>3</sub> concentration. Specifically, neutral detergent fiber was greater and relative feed value was less in plants exposed to elevated levels of O<sub>3</sub>. Similarly, in vitro dry matter digestibility tended to be less in plants exposed to elevated O<sub>3</sub>. Nutritive quality of regrowth vegetation followed a similar pattern, where neutral detergent fiber was greater and relative feed value was less in plants exposed to elevated levels of O<sub>3</sub>. These data suggest that elevated levels of ground level O<sub>3</sub> could have implications for diet selection of herbivorous mammals.
