Method of Supplementation May Affect Cattle Grazing Patterns.Supplement placement can be used to manipulate livestock grazing patterns. The objective of this case study was to compare the effect of low-moisture blocks (LMB) and range cake (barley-based cylindrical cubes, 2 cm in diameter, and 2 to 8 cm long) supplementation on cattle grazing patterns in Montana foothill rangeland. One group of nonlactating cows (<em>n</em>=79) was fed cake 3 times per week (1.8 kg·cow<sup>−1</sup>·feeding<sup>−1</sup>), and the other group (<em>n</em>=81) had continuous access to LMB in separate pastures using a crossover design. Movement patterns of cows were recorded with global positioning system collars during four periods (2 wk·period<sup>−1</sup>) during autumn. Range cake was fed on accessible areas, and LMB were placed in higher and steeper terrain. Intake of LMB averaged (mean±SE) 318±50 g·d<sup>−1</sup>. Cows fed LMB (8.07°±0.20°) were observed on steeper slopes (<em>P</em>=0.08) than cows fed range cake (6.96°±0.19°). Forage utilization decreased as slope increased to a greater degree when range cake was fed than when LMB was fed (<em>P</em>=0.001). Cows spent more time (<em>P</em>=0.05) within 100 m of LMB (274±23 min·d<sup>−1</sup>) than at range cake feeding sites (67±24 min·d<sup>−1</sup>). Strategic placement of LMB on high, steep terrain appears to be a more practical and effective approach than traditional hand-feeding range cake on intermediate terrain to improve uniformity of cattle grazing on rugged rangeland.
