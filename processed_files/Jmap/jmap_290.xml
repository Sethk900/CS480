Effects of satellite transmitters fitted to breeding Cory's shearwaters.We studied the effects of a new technique to fix satellite transmitters on the feeding behavior and chick body growth of the Cory's shearwater (<em>Calonectris diomedea</em>). Transmitters did not significantly affect the breeding bird's body mass or diving performance. However, on average, pairs with ?1 adult equipped with a transmitter brought a lighter meal (54.8±18.9g) to nestlings than did control birds or the same pair with the transmitter removed (77.4±8.3g) leading to a decreased chick body growth. However at fledging, chicks in control and treatment groups had similar body mass whether parents were equipped with a PTT or not. Our method of transmitter attachment could therefore be an appropriate alternative for studying the ecology of procellariiforms weighing <1kg given that birds are fitted with transmitters for <2 weeks and restricted to 1 parent only. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.
