Review of Chinese littoral Thalassaphorura (Collembola: Onychiuridae), with the description of two new speciesThe present paper is the third contribution to the knowledge of littoral Collembola of China. Species of the genus Thalassaphorura occurring in sandy and shingly beaches in China are reviewed. Descriptions of two new species, Thalassaphorura brevisetosa sp. nov. and Thalassaphorura hainanica sp. nov. are provided. Thalassaphorura duplopunctata and Thalassaphorura lifouensis are recorded for the first time from China, and T. duplopunctata is re-described mainly based on Chinese specimens. Thalassaphorura brevisetosa sp. nov. is characterized by having strongly reduced unguiculus and very short body chaetae. Thalassaphorura hainanica sp. nov. resembles Thalassaphorura pomorskii from which it differs by 2 + 2 pso on Abd. IV, absence of chaetae on Th. I sternum and four chaetae on subcoxa 1 of leg I, among other characters.http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:B8AC3DB3-DF12-47E2-ACEE-969D72C594C8
