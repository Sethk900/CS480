Utilizati√≥n de refugio por Liolaemus nigromaculatus: compromiso entre riesgos de predati√≥n y necesidades termorregulatoriasMicrohabitat use by a population of the iguanid Liolaemus nigromaculatus was analyzed. It was found that adults use different sites for refuge during the day. In the night, they refuge under the sand in the neighbourhood of shrubs but during mid‚Äday, they refuge under sand in the center of shrubs. The role of spacial availability, predation and thermoregulation in determining this pattern are discussed.
