The effect of tillage system and rate and time of nitrogen application on maize performance on a sandy Avalon soilFour nitrogen fertilizer regimes were superimposed on a tillage trial on a sandy Avalon soil at Dundee in 1985 in order to investigate whether the rate and time of N fertilizer application influenced the poor early-season growth and reduced yields found to occur in the treatments receiving least tillage. The tillage treatments were conventional tillage, chisel plough followed by off-set disc, chisel plough alon√© and no-till, each split for rate (50 or 200 kg N ha-1) and time (all N at planting, or split applications at planting and 6 weeks later) of N application. Both tillage method and rate of N application significantly influenced maize grain yield, plant stand and leaf N content, but time of N application appeared to have no significant effect on any of the parameters measured. Regression analysis of leaf N content at ear initiation, silking and early dent stage with grain yield indicated that the latter was most strongly correlated with N nutrition at silking.
