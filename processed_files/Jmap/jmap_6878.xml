Leaf-cutting ant nests in temperate environments: mounds, mound damages and nest mortality rate in Acromyrmex lobicornisThe mounds of ant nests have been characterized as structures that facilitate the colonization of habitats subject to extreme temperatures. My objective was to investigate the importance of the mound of Acromyrmex lobicornis (Formicidae, Attini) in this process. In the most climatically rigorous environment that this ant genus lives (northwestern Patagonia), I determined (1) the temperature range within Acromyrmex lobicornis nest-mounds, (2) the influence of mound damages on the mortality or abandonment rate of Acromyrmex lobicornis nests, and (3) compared, from the existing literature, the distribution limits between the species of Acromyrmex that do and do not construct mounds. The mounds of A. lobicornis function as 'thermal buffers' by diminishing the effects of external thermal variations, and previous mound damage increased mortality or abandonment only of colonies with nest mounds constructed on bare ground. Mounds constructed on tussock plants increased their diameter faster and recovered better from perturbations. This may be due to the structural support of plant stems facilitating repair. At a larger scale, the species of Acromyrmex with mounds have more southerly range limits than species that do not construct mounds, indicating an important function of this nest structure for the colonization of temperate environments.
