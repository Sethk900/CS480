Morphology of Eogystia sibirica (Alphéraky) (Lepidoptera: Cossidae) attacking Asparagus officinalis in northern China with descriptions of its immature stagesThe carpenter moth Eogystia sibirica (Alphéraky) (Lepidoptera: Cossidae) is a serious pest of the garden asparagus Asparagus officinalis (family Liliaceae) in northern China, with its larvae boring in the stem and roots, frequently causing significant damage to the plant. All the life stages of the pest, including egg, larva, pupa and adult, are described and illustrated in detail. The ovoid egg is covered with a reticulate meshwork of ridges on the chorion. The eruciform larva possesses only three stemmata on each side of the head; the reduced abdominal prolegs on segments III–VI each bear 35–55 uniordinal crochets arranged in two transverse bands; the short anal prolegs each bear five to seven uniordinal crochets in a transverse band. The pupa is adecticous and obtect, without cremaster. The reduction of larval stemmata and the invagination of the adult pterosterna are briefly discussed.
