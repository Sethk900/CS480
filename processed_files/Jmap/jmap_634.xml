Significance of temperature and soil water content on soil respiration in three desert ecosystems in Northwest China.It is crucial to understand how abiotic factors influence soil respiration and to determine, in a quantitative manner, the site variation of abiotic regulators in desert ecosystems. In this study, soil respiration was measured using an automated CO2 efflux system (LI-COR 8100) in 2005 and 2006. Additionally, the effects of soil temperature, moisture and a short-term precipitation manipulation on the rate of soil respiration were examined in Haloxylon ammodendron, Anabasis aphylla and Halostachys caspica in three distinct desert ecosystems. The difference in soil respiration among sites was significant. Air temperature explained 35-65% of the seasonal changes in soil respiration when an exponential equation was used. The effect of temperature on soil respiration and temperature sensitivity was stronger at sites with higher soil moisture. Soil respiration was significantly positively correlated with soil moisture. Amounts of variation in soil respiration explained by temperature and gravimetric water content were 41-44% in H. ammodendron, 62-65% in A. aphylla and 67-84% in H. caspica sites. Artificial rainfall treatments of 5 mm, 2.5 mm and 0 mm (control) were conducted. Soil respiration increased in a small pulse following rainfall. Temperature dominantly influenced soil respiration and soil water content enhanced the response of respiration to temperature.
