Abundance, habitat and body measurements of the rare Long-clawed Mouse (Pearsonomys annectens) in the coastal temperate rainforest of southern ChileBased on rodent trappings in eight localities from 1998 to 2005 (14,984 trap-nights), we provide detailed information on abundance, habitat and additional body measurements of the Long-clawed Mouse (Pearsonomys annectens), a rare rodent in the Valdivian temperate rainforest. The Long-clawed Mouse was collected in three localities only in both highly fragmented and continuous forests, including forestry plantations. The sites had relatively mature and closed vegetation and deep soils covered with leaf litter. Males appeared to be larger and heavier than females. Sexually active individuals were found in spring. We conclude that small and geographically restricted populations, low population densities, microhabitat specialization, and dependence on southern temperate forest make long-clawed mice vulnerable to the disappearance of the forest.
