Milk fat depression syndrome and the particular case of grazing cows: A reviewThe milk fat depression (MFD) syndrome is a phenomenon consisting in a reduction of milk fat content below the expected values according to stage of lactation and production level, even at levels below milk protein content, which is the opposite of the normal situation. Typical diets inducing MFD include the provision of significant quantities of concentrate or lipids inclusion. In grazing animals it is possible to observe MFD at certain critical times of the year, without the intervention of concentrated diets or external supply of lipids. There are particular circumstances, especially at the beginning of spring and autumn, or in grazing systems that favor a high selection in pasture by cows, that promote the appearance of MFD without the use of concentrated diets or lipid supplementation. In such circumstances a low level of fiber in pasture (or in the portion consumed by livestock) and a significant consumption of unsaturated fatty acids is expected, characteristic of young pastures, which have a higher proportion of leaves and lower levels of structural carbohydrates. This paper gives an account of the conditions that promote the syndrome and examines the mechanisms involved, under the situation of grazing cows.
