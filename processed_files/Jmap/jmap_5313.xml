Predatory soil nematodes (Nematoda: Mononchida) in major land-use types across IrelandThe distribution of predatory soil nematodes (Mononchida) across Europe is well described. However, in Ireland knowledge of mononchids is limited to a single study. The Cr√©Beo project was the first systematic survey of soil biodiversity in the major land-use types across the Republic of Ireland. Nematodes were sampled from 61 locations with an extensive geographical spread including arable, pasture, broadleaf forest, coniferous plantation, rough grazing and peatland sites. This study resulted in 11 first records of mononchid species from Ireland (of which 2 are new records for Britain and Ireland). We discuss the mononchid species found and aspects of their distribution across major land uses.
