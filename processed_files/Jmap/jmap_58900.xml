Chemical Characterization of PM10 for Metals in Ambient Air of Chennai, IndiaAbstractThe study was undertaken to assess the effect on ambient air concentration of PM10 and metals attributed to various localized activities at different land-use locations in Chennai City, India. The study for PM10, toxic metals, and correlation of metal and source apportionment analysis has been carried out at industrial, commercial and residential locations in the city. The monthly PM10 levels showed a significant variation among locations, and annual averages of PM10 were below the CPCB standards. Among the metals analyzed, Zn was found to dominate in all the monitoring locations. The source apportionment studies have indicated that oil burning emissions, waste incinerators and resuspension of road dust are major sources of PM10 in the study region.
