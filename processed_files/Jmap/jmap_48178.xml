Life history aspects of Phalloceros anisophallos Lucinda, 2008 (Osteichthyes, Poeciliidae) from Córrego Andorinha, Ilha Grande (RJ, Brazil)Life history traits of Phalloceros anisophallos from Córrego Andorinha, Ilha Grande (RJ, Brazil) were examined and the following parameters were evaluated: superfetation, matrotrophy, brood size, reproductive season, length–weight relationship, female weight and brood size relationship. Males were smaller and less abundant than females. According to the temporal variation of the gonadosomatic index, reproduction occurred throughout the year, with a reduction around April. We did not register superfetation among reproductive females, but there was significant increase of dry weight of developing embryos, indicating substantial matrotrophy. Such a combination of reproductive features seems to be rare in the family Poeciliidae but common in the genus Phalloceros. More studies on the other species of the genus are necessary to confirm this pattern.
