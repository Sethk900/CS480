An avian survey of a coastal scrub area, St. Kitts, West IndiesThe resident avifauna of a coastal scrub community on St. Kitts, West Indies, was surveyed in 1982 in order to examine what factors may be influencing its composition. Fifteen species were observed, three of which (Dendroica petechia, Tiaris bicolor and Columbina passerina) accounted for over 61% of the total observations. The results are briefly discussed in light of some current theories on avian community structure.
