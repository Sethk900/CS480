Population dynamics and reproductive status of Microcosmus savignyi Monniot, 1962 (Thermaikos Gulf, Eastern Mediterranean): a preliminary assessmentThe ascidian Microcosmus savignyi, a suspensionâ€feeding species, is among the prominent biota of hard substratum benthic communities in Thermaikos Gulf, showing increased population density on biogenic substrata. Considering that the biology of this species is not adequately studied, a oneâ€year study was carried out to provide information on population structure, growth parameters and reproductive status of M. savignyi stocks in Thessaloniki Bay. Population density showed a steady seasonal trend. Microcosmus savignyi experienced faster axonometric growth and reaches the maximum asymptotic length slowly, having a life span over one year. Lengthâ€frequency distributions analysis revealed the presence of two cohorts. Gonadâ€somatic index and gonad histology showed that the species is a protandrous hermaphrodite, with an expanded spawning season, lasting from the end of summer, when the release of spermatozoa begins, to the end of winter, when the release of oocytes is completed. The ecological implications of this reproductive mode are not well understood, however they may prevent selfâ€fertilization, increasing the fitness of the population to its environment.
