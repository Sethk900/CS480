Increasing Stream Geomorphic Stability Using Storm Water Control Measures in a Densely Urbanized WatershedAbstractThis study used previously established unit critical discharges, annual allowable erosional hours, and annual allowable volume of eroded bed-load standards to evaluate two types of storm water control measures (SCMs): low-impact development (LID) practices and a large detention SCM (wet pond). Nine initial scenarios modeled in PCSWMM incorporated different combinations of wet ponds, green roofs, rainwater harvesting systems, permeable pavement, and rain gardens to determine the best scenario for reducing stream erosion potential within a highly urbanized watershed in Chapel Hill, NC. The best-case scenario to reduce annual erosional hours and eroded bed load within the stream consisted of an aggressive utilization of LID practices in combination with an undersized wet pond. Although this scenario did not meet the annual erosional hour standard for rural reference streams, 0.35  h/ha/year, it did reduce erosional hours and eroded bed-load sediment by factors of 2.4 and 2.5, respectively, improving the existing condition. An alternative wet pond outlet structure that used two elevations of small drawdown orifices was explored to determine if current wet pond design practices could be improved to include stream stability. The new configuration provided a modest reduction in the number of erosional hours, a factor of 1.3, but increased the volume of eroded bed load by a factor of 1.2 when compared with the normal wet pond. However, adding widespread LID practices to the alternative outlet design reduced erosional hours and bed load transport by factors of 1.8 and 1.2, respectively, when compared with the normally configured wet pond. The failure to meet the erosional standards in all scenarios demonstrated the difficulty of requiring highly urbanized watersheds (60% impervious) to meet such strict stream protection measures.
