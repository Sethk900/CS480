Cleavage and polycondensation of pyrogallol and glycine catalyzed by natural soil claysThe ability of soil clays (<2 μm) in soil and associated environments in influencing the abiotic transformations of polyphenols and amino acids is not fully understood. The objective of this study was, thus, to investigate the catalytic power of natural soil clays in the abiotic cleavage of pyrogallol and glycine and their polycondensation. The results indicate that the ring cleavage of pyrogallol, its polymerization, the deamination of glycine, and its polycondensation with pyrogallol were enhanced by the catalysis of soil clays, and were increased with increasing temperature from 4 to 75 °C, indicating that these reactions observed in the systems were of the Arrhenius type. The main transformations of pyrogallol and glycine observed in this study are attributed to the catalysis of the layer silicates and oxides of Fe, Al, and Mn present in the natural soil clays.
