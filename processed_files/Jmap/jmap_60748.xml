Global estimates of the landâatmosphere water flux based on monthly AVHRR and ISLSCP-II data, validated at 16 FLUXNET sitesNumerous models of evapotranspiration have been published that range in data-driven complexity, but global estimates require a model that does not depend on intensive field measurements. The PriestleyâTaylor model is relatively simple, and has proven to be remarkably accurate and theoretically robust for estimates of potential evapotranspiration. Building on recent advances in ecophysiological theory that allow detection of multiple stresses on plant function using biophysical remote sensing metrics, we developed a bio-meteorological approach for translating PriestleyâTaylor estimates of potential evapotranspiration into rates of actual evapotranspiration. Five model inputs are required: net radiation (Rn), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), maximum air temperature (Tmax), and water vapor pressure (ea). Our model requires no calibration, tuning or spin-ups. The model is tested and validated against eddy covariance measurements (FLUXNET) from a wide range of climates and plant functional typesâgrassland, crop, and deciduous broadleaf, evergreen broadleaf, and evergreen needleleaf forests. The model-to-measurement r2 was 0.90 (RMS=16Â mm/month or 28%) for all 16 FLUXNET sites across 2Â years (most recent data release). Global estimates of evapotranspiration at a temporal resolution of monthly and a spatial resolution of 1Â° during the years 1986â1993 were determined using globally consistent datasets from the International Satellite Land-Surface Climatology Project, Initiative II (ISLSCP-II) and the Advanced Very High Resolution Spectroradiometer (AVHRR). Our model resulted in improved prediction of evapotranspiration across water-limited sites, and showed spatial and temporal differences in evapotranspiration globally, regionally and latitudinally.
