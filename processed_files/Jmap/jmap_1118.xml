Fourwing Saltbush Seed Yield and Quality: Irrigation, Fertilization, and Ecotype Effects.Clones of superior pollen- and seed-producing plants of 4 fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens [Pursh] Nutt.) ecotypes were planted in a seed orchard in west-central Texas to determine if seed production and quality could be enhanced by irrigation and fertilization. Subplots of nitrogen (N) at 112 kg/ha, phosphorous (P) at 112 kg/ha, N+P at 112+112 kg/ha, or no fertilizer were superimposed on irrigated or dryland main-plots. Neither irrigation nor fertilization affected estimated seed yields or utricle fill during the third growing season after planting. Fertilization did not affect seed germination of any of the saltbush ecotypes on irrigated plots or that of the 2 more xeric ecotypes (Grandfalls and Valentine) on dryland plots. Fertilizer N on dryland plots increased germination of the San Angelo ecotype, and N+P increased germination of the Texon ecotype. Estimated gross value of the first seed crop was about $4â€Š648/ha even though the superior reproductive traits of parental pis...
