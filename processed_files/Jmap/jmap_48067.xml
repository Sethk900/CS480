Two new species of hyperbenthic calanoid copepods (Crustacea: Calanoida: Arietellidae) from South KoreaTwo new calanoid copepods, Paramisophria sinjinensis sp. nov. and Paramisophria koreana sp. nov., were collected from shallow waters of South Korea. Male P. sinjinensis can be easily distinguished from its congeners by the following characteristics: gnathobase of mandible with three teeth, lack of endopod on left leg 5 and second exopodal segment on right leg 5 hollow on inner distal margin. Paramisophria koreana is most similar to Paramisophria cluthae but differs in the presence of a seta on the first exopodal segment of right leg 5 of males, and one short and four long spines on the praecoxal arthrite of the maxillule. In the exopodal segment of female leg 5, the distal spine is approximately 2.5 times longer than the subdistal spine. The results of cladistic analysis based on morphological characters revealed that the two new species are closely related to Paramisophria ammophila Fosshagen, 1968 and P. cluthae T. Scott, 1897. http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:38DBB79D-2C21-45B1-B5AD-80A4603DCF6B
