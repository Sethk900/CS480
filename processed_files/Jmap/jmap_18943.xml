Soil CO2 evolution in Quercus variabilis and Q. mongolica forests in Chunchon, Kangwon Province.Infrared gas analysis (IRGA) method was used to measure soil CO2 evolution at the soil surface in three natural deciduous oak forests (Quercus mongolica Fish. stand and two Q. variabils B1. stands) in Chunchon, Kangwon Province. Soil moisture and soil temperature were measured concurrently with soil CO2 evolution. There were strong positive correlations of soil CO2 evolution with soil temperature in all study stands, but no significant correlations between soil moisture and soil CO2 evolution. The seasonal fluctuations in soil CO2 evolution increasing in summer and decreasing in winter, corresponded to changes in the soil temperature. Peaks in seasonal soil CO2 evolution occurred in July and August. Annual mean soil CO2 evolution ranged from 0.51-0.52 g CO2/m2/hr for Q. variabilis stands to 0.57 g CO2/m2/hr for the Q. mongolica stand. The Q10 values ranged from 3.9-4.0 for Q. variabilis stands to 5.3 for the Q. mongolica stand. In summer (June-August), soil CO2 evolution was greater in Q. mongolica stand than in Q. variabilis stands but the reverse was true for the other seasons. In the study site, soil respiration during summer was above 50% of annual total soil respiration (Q. variabilis stands; 51.8-52.7%, Q. mongolica stand; 58.8%). Annual total soil respiration was 31.45-34.84 t CO2/ha/yr for the Q. variabilis stands, and 34.17 t CO2/ha/yr for Q. mongolica stand, respectively.
