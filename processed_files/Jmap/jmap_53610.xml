Two new related oodine genera in the Oriental Region, with remarks on the systematic position of the genera Hololeius and Holosoma (Coleoptera, Carabidae)Two new genera of Oodini LaFerté-Sénectére, 1851 are described: Bamaroodes gen. n. (type species: Hololeius cyaneus Facchini, 2011) for Bamaroodes cyaneus (Facchini, 2011), comb. n., here placed in tribe Oodini and removed from Chlaeniini Brullé, 1834; and Thaioodes gen. n. (type species: Thaioodes piceus sp. n.) for Thaioodes piceus sp. n. (type locality: Khon Kaen, Thailand). The new genera are closely related and belong to the same lineage as evidenced by the following combination of characters: body shape semi-elongate; discal setiferous pore lacking in interval 3 of elytra; mesocoxa without lateral seta; tarsomere 5 setose ventrally; joints of the claws of tarsomere 5 parallel, situated closely to each other. The two genera are readily distinguished from one another by a number of distinct characters.  Further, the tribal position of two other genera is reconsidered. The monospecific Hololeius LaFerté-Sénectére, 1851 is redescribed and its current placement within Chlaeniini is confirmed, though it might be distantly related to the two new genera. Analysis of character states in species of Holosoma Semenov, 1889 leads me to transfer the genus from Oodini to Chlaeniini. Pictures of the taxa dealt with here are provided, including habitus, external characters, and genitalia. In addition, all the genera of the Oodini from the Oriental Region, including genera of Oriental Chlaeniini with oodine facies, are keyed for the first time.
