A limnological reconnaissance of the Falkland Islands; with particular reference to the waterfleas (Arthropoda: Anomopoda)Fortyâ€eight freshwater bodies on the Falkland Islands, including 33 lakes and pools, and 12 rivers and streams, were sampled for freshwater invertebrates. This study yielded 129 species of invertebrates (79 Rotifera, 34 Arthropoda, six Platyhelminthes, three Gastrotricha, two Nematoda, two Annelida, two Mollusca, and one Tardigrada) plus two fish species bringing the known Falkland Islands freshwater fauna to more than 170 species. While the presence of fishes, molluscs, amphipods, caddis larvae, waterboatmen, parasitic cercaria, and truly planktonic rotifers make the Falkland Islands fauna markedly richer than any subantarctic, or maritime Antarctic island, it is nevertheless sparse when compared with other temperate and tropical locations.
