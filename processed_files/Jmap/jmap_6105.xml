The effect of clone type and method of transportation on oil yield from vegetative material of Eriocephalus punctulatusEriocephalus punctulatus, also known as, ‘Kapok Bos’, belongs to the Asteraceae family. It is an attractively scented woody shrub, that reaches a height of about one metre. It produces a highly priced essential oil with a dark blue colour and an attractive fresh fruity fragrance. The most profitable time to harvest this crop in the Eastern Cape is during the months of October and November when the plants have reached the full flower/seed set stage. However, there is a major reduction in oil yield, per kilogram of vegetative material, during transportation from the cultivation fields to the extraction facility, particularly if the wind speeds exceed 50 km/h. Oil yield was increased if the material was processed a few days after harvest.
