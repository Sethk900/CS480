Te phytal of the alga Amphiroa fragilissima (Linnaeus) Lamouroux, 1816Abstract The annual fluctuation of the animal community on the densely branched calcareous alga Amphiroa fragilissima is described. The density of this phytal was compared with the other phytals of the world. A. fragilissima showed a rich fauna. This richness is due partly to high adsorption coefficient of the alga.
