Teratological changes in tick morphology in ticks feeding on exotic reptilesThe paper describes 13 teratological cases of anomalies in the morphology of exotic ticks from three species: Amblyomma latum, Amblyomma flavomaculatum and Hyalomma aegyptium. The ticks parasitized reptiles (Python regius, Varanus exanthematicus, Testudo marginata), that were imported into Poland from Africa and suthern Europe for the purpose of breeding in terraria. General anomalies were found that were related to the asymmetry and bifurcation of the idiosoma and local anomalies, which are related to structures on the surface of the body: oligomely of the porose area, anomaly in the form and course of the anal groove, and anomalies of the legs: heteromorphism, oligomely and atrophy of the leg, as well as cases of complex anomalies. Knowledge of cases of morphological anomalies in ticks can help to greatly reduce taxonomic errors in determining the species affiliation of the teratologically altered tick.
