On the Austral-Antarctic stenothoids Proboloides, Metopoides, Torometopa and Scaphodactylus (Crustacea Amphipoda) Part 2: the genus Proboloides, with description of two new genera and the transfer of two nominal species to MetopoidesAbstract This is the second part of a revision of the most plesiomorphic genera in the amphipod family Stenothoidae sensu lato (see Krapp-Schickel and Koenemann 2006 for an overview and Krapp-Schickel 2008 for the first part). 41 species not belonging to Metopoides were plotted in a matrix using the same 61 characters as in the first part. The resulting group of Proboloides species (most probably not existing in the Austral-Antarctic region) is discussed, a key for the members given and two new genera erected. Some species described as Proboloides are redescribed and 2 species transferred to Metopoides. A key for all actual members of. The remaining species, i.e. those actually being in the genera Torometopa and Scaphodactylus, will be dealt with in the final part of this series, together with a key to all of them.
