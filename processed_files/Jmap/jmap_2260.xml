Spatial and Seasonal Patterns of Bird Communities in Italian Agroecosystems.Despite agricultural landscapes covering almost 60% of the total land area of Italy, knowledge of the effects of agriculture and its intensification on bird communities is still scarce. I analyzed the effects of land uses on bird diversity and community structure in different farmland habitats of lowland northwestern Italy. I surveyed breeding and overwintering birds with a hierarchically nested sampling design and used generalized linear and mixed models to investigate the relationships between the diversity and abundance of birds and habitat or landscapes attributes. The effects of agriculture on &alpha; avian diversity varied with season and spatial scale, whereas nonagricultural habitats (long-term fallows or woodlands) had a generally positive effect that was constant throughout time and space. As the amount of woodland habitat increased, spatial turnover (&beta; diversity) of breeding birds decreased. Arable landscapes supported low levels of avian diversity throughout the year but were favored by emblematic farmland birds that have declined severely in Europe and in the study area. Farmland birds (40% of which are experiencing population declines) were more abundant or foraged more frequently in the less-disturbed habitat types such as fallows, grasslands, and winter stubbles and tended to avoid the prevailing cultivations (maize, vineyard, and wheat). Landscape simplification, the expansion of maize cultivation, winter plowing practices, and the conversion of highly diverse grasslands to tilled lands are likely to be responsible for the local decline of most farmland species (Skylark<em>[Alauda arvensis</em>], Starling<em>[Sturnus vulgaris</em>], buntings<em>[Emberiza </em>spp.], and wagtails<em>[Motacilla </em>spp.]) and for the increase of birds that are turning into agricultural pests (Hooded Crow<em>[Corvus corone cornix</em>]).
