Low temperature treatment advances flowering in Clivia miniata (Lindley) RegelClivia miniata plants were exposed to a cold treatment of 7.5–10 °C for 14 days in the dark from 24 April 2000. Compared to the non-cold treated control plants, the cold-treated plants started flowering four weeks earlier resulting in 80% of the cold treated plants being ready for sale before or during the first week in August as compared to 76% of the control plants that were marketable by the last week of August.
