Revision of the fern genus Orthiopteris (Saccolomataceae) in Malesia and adjacent regionsA taxonomic revision of the Old-World representatives of the fern genus Orthiopteris is presented. We recognize eight species, one of which is newly described (Orthiopteris samoensis), and five varieties, of which two are newly described (O. campylura var. insularis and O. campylura var. laxa). Orthiopteris acuminata, O. caudata, O. minor and O. kingii are all reduced to varieties of O. campylura.
