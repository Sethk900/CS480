Structure and pore system in differently managed clayey surface soil as described by micromorphology and image analysisWater infiltration is a crucial process for functioning of vegetated buffer zones (BZ). Structure of a clayey surface soil of three differently managed BZs, i.e., 1) natural with no treatment, 2) harvested once a year and 3) grazed by cattle was investigated in this study. Soil macro pores (> 50 μm) were characterized by qualitative description and quantitative image analysis of soil thin sections in order to assess their capability to water infiltration. Less than 10% of the macro pores consisted of rounded and irregular pores smaller than 300 μm indicating root activity. Instead, macro porosity was clearly dominated by elongated pores characterized by irregularity, expressing the complexity of the pore system. This pore pattern appeared in thin sections as weak or moderate ped separation suggesting good water infiltration when initially dry. Partial accommodation of pores may result in decrease of hydraulic conductivity, as these pores tend to close upon wetting and swelling. In the grazed site a platy structure was observed due to hoof pressure, which may further impair the hydraulic properties of soil. Moisture and temperature related processes (shrink–swell, freeze–thaw, and water saturation) are thought to be conducive to the aggregation and rearrangement of soil structure around the year, resulting in a complex pore system with low intra-aggregate porosity. In addition, wet periods typical of boreal soils result in clay dispersion and formation of aggregate-related pedofeatures of dense infillings, described as fine clay intrusions.
