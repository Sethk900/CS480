Assessment of Abilities of White-Tailed Deer to Jump Fences.There is a need for insight into fence heights required for impeding white-tailed deer (<em>Odocoileus virginianus</em>). We evaluated the ability of wild-caught deer to jump progressively taller fences and documented deterrence rates of 0% for fences ?1.5 m followed by increasing deterrence rates of 14% at 1.8 m, 85% at 2.1 m, and 100% at 2.4 m. We documented 100% deterrence rates during 5 additional experiments with different deer and the test fence at 2.4 m, a common height of fences at captive deer facilities. Our results will be valuable to those managing spread of wildlife diseases, deer-vehicle collisions, and agricultural damage.
