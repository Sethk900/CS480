Mapping incident photosynthetically active radiation from MODIS data over ChinaPhotosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is a key input parameter for almost all terrestrial ecosystem models, but the spatial resolution of current PAR products is too coarse to satisfy regional application requirements. In this paper, we present an operational system for PAR retrieval from MODIS data that is based on an idea proposed by [Liang, S., Zheng, T., Liu, R., Fang, H., Tsay, S. -C., & Running, S. (2006). Estimation of incident photosynthetically active radiation from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer data. Journal of Geophysical Research, 111, D15208. doi:10.1029/2005JD006730]. However, the operational system for PAR retrieval described here contains several improvements. The algorithm utilizes MODIS 1B data combining MODIS land surface products and BRDF model parameters products to directly estimate diffuse PAR, direct PAR and total PAR. Times-series data interpolation removes the noise and cloud contamination of land surface reflectance. PAR is retrieved by searching look-up tables calculated using a radiative transfer model. The system can automatically process MODIS 1B data to generate instantaneous and daily PAR. The instantaneous PAR products are compared with observational data from seven ChinaFLUX stations, and daily total PAR estimates are compared with those estimates of global radiation from 98 meteorological stations over China. The results indicate that this approach can produce reasonable PAR estimates, although this method overestimates PAR for low values of PAR.
