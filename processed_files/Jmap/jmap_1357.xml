Polytrichum Strictum as a Solution to Frost Heaving in Disturbed Ecosystems: A Case Study with Milled Peatlands.Substrate instability is a common problem in many disturbed ecosystems. In the case of milled harvested peatlands, the pioneer moss <em>Polytrichum strictum</em> is commonly found; it is well adapted to tolerate the harsh microclimatic conditions and peat instability of these sites. A field experiment was used to determine the effectiveness of <em>P. strictum</em> against frost heaving, a major type of disturbance on bare peat. Wooden dowels and fir trees (<em>Abies balsamea</em>) placed in a <em>P. strictum</em> carpet experienced almost no frost heaving, whereas heaving was severe on bare peat. Reintroduced <em>P. strictum</em> fragments thinly spread on bare peat reduced but did not eliminate frost heaving. Straw mulch (a protective cover often required in peatland restoration) effectively reduced heaving in the fall, but was less effective in the spring because it had partially decomposed. The <em>P. strictum</em> carpet, <em>P. strictum</em> fragments, and straw mulch reduced frost heaving by reducing the number of freeze-thaw cycles, by slowing the rate of ground thaw in the spring, and by reducing the unfrozen water content of the peat during the spring thaw. Different species of <em>Polytrichum</em> mosses should be considered for the restoration or regeneration of disturbed ecosystems where soil stability is problematic.
