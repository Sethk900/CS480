The development of harvesting schedules and post-harvesting management practices relative to oil yield of Eriocephalus punctulatusThe first phase in the domestication programme of Eriocephalus punctulatus involved establishing how this crop could be harvested without adversely affecting plant vigour and longevity. The second phase of the domestication programme was the development of harvesting schedules that would result in high yields of oil without affecting the longevity of the plants. Highest oil yield occurred in mature plants once they had reached the flowering stage. For optimum oil recovery, harvested material must be processed within seven days. Other post- harvesting management practices such as the effect of drying plant material before distillation were also evaluated.
