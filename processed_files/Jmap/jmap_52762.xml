Irrigation, a productive tool for food security â€“ a reviewWater scarcity in agriculture is becoming a major problem due to increasing demand from nonagricultural uses and intensive crop management on existing croplands to meet the needs of an expanding global population. Efficient use of the available irrigation water is therefore of important concern. Even though intensive research in the areas of crop physiology, irrigation engineering, agronomy and agricultural economics has developed several ways to improve the efficiency of irrigation water, a multidisciplinary approach is often regarded as the best future path to achieve further enhancements in meeting the forthcoming challenge of producing more and safety foods. Failure of irrigation production has profound effects on the welfare of all those employed in it and also their customers. Indeed, the scale of the industry is such that world food prices will be influenced by the overall performance of the irrigation farmers, but low food prices are essential to the welfare of the poorest people. The contribution of irrigation and water management to increased food production must come through both expansion of irrigation and improved management of existing water supplies. This review presents the past, current and future panorama of irrigation as a viable tool in ensuring food security on the globe. Considering past trends, this review empathizes that future irrigation technologies should be focused on providing the leadership and capacity to capture, develop and promote new irrigation practices and management systems to optimize production.
