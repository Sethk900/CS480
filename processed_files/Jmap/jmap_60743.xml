A voxel-based lidar method for estimating crown base height for deciduous and pine treesThe overall goal of this study was to develop methods for assessing crown base height for individual trees using airborne lidar data in forest settings typical for the southeastern United States. More specific objectives are to: (1) develop new lidar-derived features as multiband height bins and processing techniques for characterizing the vertical structure of individual tree crowns; (2) investigate several techniques for filtering and analyzing vertical profiles of individual trees to derive crown base height, such as Fourier and wavelet filtering, polynomial fit, and percentile analysis; (3) assess the accuracy of estimating crown base height for individual trees, and (4) investigate which type of lidar data, point frequency or intensity, provides the most accurate estimate of crown base height. A lidar software application, TreeVaW, was used to locate individual trees and to obtain per tree measurements of height and crown width. Tree locations were used with lidar height bins to derive the vertical structure of tree crowns and measurements of crown base height. Lidar-derived crown base heights of individual trees were compared to field observations for 117 trees, including 94 pines and 23 deciduous trees. Linear regression models were able to explain up to 80% of the variability associated with crown base height for individual trees. Fourier filtering used for smoothing the vertical crown profile consistently provided the best results when estimating crown base height.
