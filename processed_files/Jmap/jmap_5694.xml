Phylogenetic analysis of the subgenus Lampetis (Spinthoptera) (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) of North and Central America, and the West IndiesPhylogenetic relationships between species of Lampetis (Spinthoptera) of North and Central America and the West Indies were analysed by cladistic methods, based on 65 characters from the external morphology and male genitalia. Eleven species of different generic groups of the subtribe Dicercina were considered as outgroups, including also species of Lampetis (Lampetis) and one South American species of L. (Spinthoptera). The monophyly of Lampetis (Spinthoptera) is supported by two synapomorphies, but this subgenus appears to be more closely related to species of Psiloptera rather than to Old World species of Lampetis (Lampetis), suggesting that Lampetis (Spinthoptera) may be segregated from Lampetis as a different genus. The species of Lampetis (Spinthoptera) from North and Central America and the West Indies do not represent a monophyletic taxon, because L. (S.) tucumana (South American outgroup) is nested within them. Comparison of these results with a previous panbiogeographic analysis indicate that several generalized tracks possess species from different clades, thus suggesting an ancient radiation of this taxon in Mesoamerica and the Mexican Transition Zone.
