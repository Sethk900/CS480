A comparison of three methods of determining the cation exchange capacity of calcareous soilsThree widely used methods for cation exchange capacity determination, viz. sodium acetate, Bascomb's and 45Ca isotopic dilution methods have been compared. Sodium acetate and Bascomb's methods gave similar values for most of the samples. Though some correction for the organic matter and calcium carbonate content are of concern for the 45Ca method, the results do not preclude use of the latter for the cation exchange capacity determination. In the 45Ca method organic matter contributed mostly to the cation exchange capacity, whereas for the other two methods the relative contribution of clay was found to be higher. The lowest contribution of calcium carbonate to the cation exchange capacity was observed in Bascomb's method. Simple and multiple regression relationships between cation exchange capacity and organic matter, clay and calcium carbonate are discussed.
