Availability and toxicity of exogenous lanthanum in a haplic acrisolsThe availability and toxicity of exogenous lanthanum in a haplic acrisols were studied through laboratory incubation and pot culture experiments. The soil was collected from the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Red Soil Ecological Experimental Station, located in Jiangxi Province, southern China and sampled from croplands which have been used to grow rice and rape in rotation for 3 years. The available La in soil was extracted by 0.05 mol lâˆ’1 HCl and determined by a double focusing type of inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and toxicity of La was determined by the evaluation of relative luminosity of Photobacterium phosphoreum T3. The exogenous La was highly available in soil, and the average available La accounted for 56.6% of exogenous La after 1 week of incubation. However, the availability of exogenous La in soil had a tendency to decrease with the prolonged incubation time. La in aqueous solution was biologically toxic, and there was a significant negative correlation (p<0.01) between the relative luminosity of P. phosphoreum T3 and the concentration of La in water solution. La was biologically toxic in soil, and a significant negative correlation (p<0.01) was observed between the relative luminosity of P. phosphoreum T3 and exogenous La, indicating that the excessive exogenous La in soil may produce harmful effects to soil microbial community.
