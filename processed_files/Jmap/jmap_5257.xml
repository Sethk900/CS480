The copepod Balaenophilus manatorum (Ortíz, Lalana and Torres, 1992) (Harpacticoida), an epibiont of the Caribbean manateeThe harpacticoid copepod Balaenophilus manatorum (Ortíz, Lalana and Torres, 1992) was originally described based on a few specimens collected from a single manatee in Cuba. Since its description it has been recorded exclusively as a symbiont of sea turtles worldwide; there were no further records of this species from the manatee and this association remained unconfirmed. During a long-term survey on the biology and ecology of the manatee Trichechus manatus manatus L. in Mexican waters of the western Caribbean, epibionts were collected from 54 individuals, including males, females and juveniles. Many specimens of B. manatorum were recorded from several manatees and analysed morphologically; a comparison is made with specimens from turtles of the Mexican Pacific. Manatees captured in two different bay systems were examined, but only those from Chetumal Bay were positive for copepods. Infestation comprised 14 manatees (26%), eight females and six males; incidence was higher than that previously found for other crustacean epibionts. Copepods were found as soft yellowish masses arranged along skin folds and wrinkles of the muzzle, the base of the fins, and the nipple area; there was no evidence of skin damage caused by the copepod. The presence of B. manatorum on manatees is confirmed and the first data are provided on the prevalence of this epibiont in one of the main populations of this mammal in the western Caribbean.
