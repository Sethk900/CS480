Coupled Data-Driven Evolutionary Algorithm for Toxic Cyanobacteria (Blue-Green Algae) Forecasting in Lake KinneretAbstractCyanobacteria blooming in surface waters have become a major concern worldwide, as they are unsightly, and cause a variety of toxins, undesirable tastes, and odors. Approaches of mathematical process-based (deterministic), statistically based, rule-based (heuristic), and artificial neural networks have been the subject of extensive research for cyanobacteria forecasting. This study suggests a new framework of linking an evolutionary computational method (a genetic algorithm) with a data driven modeling engine (model trees) for external loading, physical, chemical, and biological parameters selection, all coupled with their associated time lags as decision variables for cyanobacteria prediction in surface waters. The methodology is demonstrated through trial runs and sensitivity analyses on Lake Kinneret (the Sea of Galilee), Israel. Model trials produced good matching as depicted through the results correlation coefficient on verification data sets. Temperature was reconfirmed as a predominant parameter for cyanobacteria prediction. Model optimal input variables and forecast horizons differed in various solutions. Those in turn raised the problem of best variables selection, pointing towards the need of a multiobjective optimization model in future extensions of the proposed methodology.
