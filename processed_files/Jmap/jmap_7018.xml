Contribuci√≥n al conocimiento de la dieta del pato picazo (Netta peposaca) en cultivos de arroz (Oryza sativa) (Prov. Santa F√©, Argentina)Food selection of 24 captured Rosy‚Äbilled Pochards, which had visited rice fields in the alluvial valley of the Paran√° river in Argentine during the months from March to May in 1989, has been studied in order to compare the results with others from natural settings. A qualitative‚Äquantitative analysis provided the typical herbivorous pattern with grains of the rice (Oryza sativa) and other grain‚Äbearing species, i.e. Panicum sp., Polygonum sp., Paspalum sp. and Echinochloa sp. with rice being the pre‚Ädominant species. The quantitative results are given in the tables.
