Recent species of the Family Candonidae (Ostracoda, Crustacea) from the ancient Lake Biwa, Central JapanSampling of Lake Biwa between November 1997 and February 2007 has revealed a diverse Candonidae fauna consisting of 18 species. Eleven are previously undescribed species, belonging to the genera Fabaeformiscandona (nine species), Pseudocandona (one species) and Cypria (one species), and 10 of these are potentially endemic to the lake. In total there are 12 Fabaeformiscandona species in the lake belonging to two subâ€groups based on the number of setae on the mandible palp, the fabaeformisâ€group (10 species) and the acuminataâ€group (two species). Including the new Fabaeformiscandona species described herein, Lake Biwa is home to 19% of the approximately 62 described living species of this genus known globally. Although, the new Fabaeformiscandona species are potentially endemic, they do not show a microevolutionary pattern similar to that suggested for the Tanganyikan Cyprideis species flock.
