Biased estimates of fitness consequences of brood size manipulation through correlated effects on natal dispersal.<ol><li>Dispersal of parents and offspring in relation to manipulated brood size were analysed in the great tit <em>Parus major</em> (L.) to study the potential confusion between dispersal and survival. The study area consisted of eight woodlots interspersed with nonbreeding habitat. The maximum distance between nestboxes was 10 km.</li><li>The brood size of pairs with similar clutch size and laying date was manipulated in 3 years when chicks were 2 days old (1995, 1997 and 1998). Three nestlings were removed from one and added to another brood while a third was kept as a control. Offspring were measured, weighed and marked and breeding birds were captured and marked to allow dispersal estimates.</li><li>For the offspring, dispersal was estimated as the distance between the natal nestbox and the nestbox of first breeding (natal dispersal distance) and, for the parents, as the distance between breeding boxes in two subsequent seasons (breeding dispersal distance).</li><li>Natal dispersal distance was positively affected by brood size manipulation. This effect was more pronounced in males than in females. Breeding dispersal distance was not affected by manipulation.</li><li>The practical consequence of this finding is that fitness estimates used to measure selection on brood size did depend on the spatial scale of the study area. For the Lauwersmeer population measured selection pressure changed from positive to stabilizing when I restricted the spatial scale of recovery. Other brood size manipulation experiments may suffer from similar biases in their fitness estimates.</li><li>The biological consequence of this finding is that, if clutch size has a heritable component, local adaptation of clutch size will depend on the spatial heterogeneity of the habitat.</li></ol>
