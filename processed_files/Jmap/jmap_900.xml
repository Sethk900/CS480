The relative importance of different seed dispersal modes in dry Mongolian rangelands.Nomadic livestock husbandry is the main form of land use in Mongolia. Grazing impact on plant productivity has frequently been studied, but effects on dispersal modes are largely unknown. We assessed the relative importance of zoochorous dispersal for several species but focused on the dominant fodder grasses Agropyron cristatum and Stipa krylovii. We searched for seeds in the fur of goats and sheep, but also experimentally attached diaspores and monitored retention. Endozoochory was tested by incubating faecal samples under standardised conditions. Lab experiments on zoochory, anemochory and hydrochory supplemented the field studies.
