A new species of Paratubana from the Atlantic Forest of Brazil and a key to males of the genus (Insecta: Hemiptera: Cicadellidae: Cicadellini)Paratubana serrana, a new species from the Atlantic Forest of the states of Rio de Janeiro and Paran√°, Brazil, is described and illustrated based on male and female specimens. The new taxon can be distinguished from the seven known species of Paratubana Young, 1977 by features of the male genitalia and color pattern (especially the dark red forewings with two broad longitudinal yellowish-brown to whitish stripes, one along the costal margin and another along the inner claval margin). The female genitalia of a Paratubana species are described in detail for the first time. A key to males of eight known species of the genus is added. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:EAC7DDC6-F963-4A93-AA2C-AEE47B2439CE
