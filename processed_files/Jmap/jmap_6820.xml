Factors affecting the activity of atrazine in plants and soilAvailable research findings concerning (he activity of atrazine in the plant and soil are presented in a brief review. The role of the environment is emphasized. This review is supplemented by recent research results of the University of Pretoria concerning evaluation of soil characteristics as a norm for the prediction of atrazine activity in turf soils, the comparison of a few maize hybrids with respect to their resistance towards atrazine and the influence of moisture and temperature on atrazine activity in light-textured soils. Guidelines for future research and for the use of atrazine are given. S. Afr. J. Plant Soil 1984, 1: 67â€“72
