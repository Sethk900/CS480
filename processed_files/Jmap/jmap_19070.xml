Soil and root respiration in mature Alaskan black spruce forests that vary in soil organic matter decomposition ratesClimate warming at high latitudes is expected to increase root and microbial respiration and thus cause an increase in soil respiration. We measured the root and microbial components of soil respiration near Fairbanks, Alaska, in 2000 and 2001, in three black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill) B. S. P.) forests. We hypothesized faster decomposition correlates with greater amounts of both root and microbial contributions to soil respiration. Contrary to our prediction, the site with the coolest summer soil temperatures and slowest decomposition (site identification "high-np") had significantly (p < 0.05) greater growing season soil respiration (485 g C.m(-2).year(-1)) than the two other sites (372 and 332 g C.m(-2).year(-1)). Spruce C allocation to root respiration was significantly greater, and fine-root N concentration was 10% and 12% greater (p < 0.05) at high-np than at the other two sites. High-np spruce foliage was also more enriched in C-13 and depleted in N-15, suggesting either lower available moisture or slower N turnover. Either factor could drive greater C allocation to roots; however, a literature review suggests moisture deficit corresponds to greater C allocation to roots in black spruce forests across the boreal ecosystem. Controls on spruce C allocation need to be resolved before making the generalization that soil respiration will increase with warming in this forest type.
