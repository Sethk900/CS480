The effect of rootstock cultivar on the yield and fruit quality of ‘Packham's Triumph’, ‘Doyenne du Comice’, ‘Forelle’, ‘Flamingo’ and ‘Rosemarie’ pearsProduction data and questionnaire results concerning the long-term effects of various rootstocks on pear (Pyrus communis L.) yield indicated that BP1 and BP3 are currently the preferred rootstocks in the South African industry. Yield records of ‘Packham's Triumph’ pears indicated that BP3 and Old Home × Farmingdale 97′ (OH×F97) rootstocks were superior to other rootstocks. Yield of ‘Doyenne du Comice’ was highest on ‘Quince A’ (QA) and BP3. The yield and fruit quality of blushed pear cultivars, Rosemarie, Flamingo, and Forelle, were evaluated in replicated trials on different rootstocks in different areas, planted in 1996 and 1997. Parameters measured included trunk growth, yield, fruit quality, and fruit mineral content. ‘Rosemarie’ showed indications of incompatibility with QA and ‘Quince C51’ (QC51), but produced good initial yields on BP1 and QA with a ‘Beurre Hardy’ interstem. BP1 induced a slightly larger tree. ‘Flamingo’ on QA and QC51 produced the best yields. ‘Forelle’ on BP1, BP3, and QA produced similar yields up to the fourth leaf. Further long-term studies are needed.
