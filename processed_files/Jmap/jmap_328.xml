Maned Wolf Density in a Central Brazilian Grassland Reserve.The maned wolf (<em>Chrysocyon brachyurus</em>) inhabits the savannah-like Cerrado of Brazil. Although 80% of this biome has already been affected by human activity, little is known about maned wolf abundance. Using mark-recapture models, we obtained the first density estimate from central Brazil, the core of maned wolf distribution. With 5.19 individuals/100 km<sup>2</sup>, even large reserves support only small maned wolf populations. Therefore, long-term conservation of the maned wolf depends on land management outside of reserves.
