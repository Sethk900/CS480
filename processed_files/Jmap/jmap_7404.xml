A study about the Coelom of four Haementeria Filippi, 1849 species (Glossiphoniidae, Rhynchobdellae, Hirudinea)Abstract Six types of coelomic sinuses arranged in five longitudinal stems (one median, two paramedian and two lateral) and a system of transversal branches were observed in adult and young individuals of Haementeria depressa and H. lutzi, and in adult forms only in H. tuberculifera and H. vizottoi. Some information about the relative position of the different sinuses as referred to the body segments and to other systems of organs is given, as well as about the internal structure and the connections linking the sinuses to one another. In H. depressa and H. lutzi, a relationship between the hypodermic sinuses and the circular muscle fibres of the body is reported. An account of the figurative elements of the coelom, and the relationship between acid cell size and organisms maturity is also given.
