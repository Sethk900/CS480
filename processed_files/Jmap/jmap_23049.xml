Review of Canadian species of the genus Dinaraea Thomson, with descriptions of six new species (Coleoptera, Staphylinidae, Aleocharinae, Athetini)Abstract Twelve species of the genus Dinaraea Thomson are recognized in the Nearctic region, ten of which occur in Canada, all east of the Rocky Mountains. Six species are herein described as new to science: Dinaraea bicornis Klimaszewski & Webster, sp. n.; Dinaraea curtipenis Klimaszewski & Webster, sp. n.; Dinaraea longipenis Klimaszewski & Webster, sp. n.; Dinaraea quadricornis Klimaszewski & Webster, sp. n.; Dinaraea worki Klimaszewski & Jacobs, sp. n.; and Dinaraea piceana Klimaszewski & Jacobs, sp. n. Four formerly described species are confirmed in Canada: Dinaraea angustula (Thomson), Dinaraea backusensis Klimaszewski & Brunke, Dinaraea borealis Lohse, and Dinaraea pacei Klimaszewki & Langor. The previously unknown male of Dinaraea borealis Lohse and female of Dinaraea backusensis are described. All species are illustrated with colour habitus images and black and white images of the median lobe of the aedeagus and spermatheca, and tergite VIII and sternite VIII of both sexes. New habitat and distribution data are presented and a key to all Nearctic species of the genus is provided.
