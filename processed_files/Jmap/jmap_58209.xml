Coupling a Regional Climate Model and a Distributed Hydrological Model to Assess Future Water Resources in Jinhua River Basin, East ChinaAbstractInvestigating the impact of climate change at regional scales is of importance for adaption purposes. In this study, a regional climate model PRECIS is for the first time run for East China on a spatial resolution of 25 km using two global climate models (GCMs) ECHAM5 and HadCM3 as boundary data under A1B emission scenario. The baseline period is 1961–1990. An upgraded quantile mapping method is used to correct the bias of PRECIS outputs for providing reliable future climate change projections (2011–2040). The regional climate model is then coupled with a mesoscale distributed hydrology soil vegetation model (DHSVM), to investigate the impact of climate change on future water resources in the Jinhua River Basin, East China. The hydrological model is calibrated and validated on a daily basis and show reasonable performance. The results show that under both GCMs, statistically, no significant changes in future annual runoff are projected. However, large changes in seasonal and monthly runoff are projected. ECHAM5 projects large decreases in summer (−11.8%) and autumn (−54.7%) and slight increases in spring and winter whereas HadCM3 projects large decreases in autumn (−65%) and large increases in spring (28.7%) and winter (60%). The seasonal changes in precipitation in this region are the main driving force for the changes in future runoff.
