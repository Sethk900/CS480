Evaluation of soil quality for agricultural production using visible–near-infrared spectroscopySoil quality (SQ) assessment has numerous applications for agricultural management. Conventional quantification of SQ is based on laboratory analysis and integrative indices that can be costly and time consuming to obtain. A rapid, quantitative method using soil spectra, following the successful process of soil characterization by visible (VIS)–near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, can provide a robust approach for soil monitoring.
