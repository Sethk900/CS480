Dynamics of nitrous oxide in groundwater at the aquatic-terrestrial interface.Few data are available to validate the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) emission factors for indirect emissions of nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O). In particular the N<sub>2</sub>O emissions resulting from nitrogen leaching and the associated groundwater and surface drainage (EF5-g) are particularly poorly characterized. <em>In situ</em> push-pull methods have been used to identify the fate of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-;</sup> in the groundwater. In this study, we adapted a previously published <em>in situ</em> denitrification push-pull method to examine the fate of <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>O introduced into the subsoil-groundwater matrix. Enriched <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>O was manufactured, added to groundwater via a closed system in the laboratory, and then introduced into the groundwater-subsoil matrix in an upland-marsh transition zone of a salt marsh and a forested alluvial riparian zone. Conservative tracers (SF<sub>6</sub> and Br<sup>-;</sup>) and <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>O were injected into the groundwater and left for 1-4 h after which the groundwater was sampled. Added <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>O behaved in a conservative manner at one site while the other site showed variability with some injections showing significant consumption (3-8 &mu;g N<sub>2</sub>O-<sup>15</sup>N kg<sup>-;1</sup> soil day<sup>-;1</sup>) of <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>O. Our results show that the fate and dynamics of N<sub>2</sub>O in groundwater are complex and variable and that these dynamics should be considered in the development of improved IPCC inventory calculations.
