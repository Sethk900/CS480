Redescription of arenicolous dipluran Parajapyx pauliani (Diplura, Parajapygidae) and DNA barcoding analyses of Parajapyx from ChinaAbstract Littoral dipluran Parajapyx pauliani Pag√©s, 1959 was redescribed based on the specimens collected in Hainan Island, South China. The littoral habitat was confirmed for the species, as the first report of arenicolous dipluran in China. DNA barcoding fragment was sequenced for five Parajapyx species (18 individuals) from China, and this is the first report on DNA barcodes used for dipluran identification. The mean intra- and interspecific divergencesare 1.9% and 19.1% respectively. Synonymy of Parajapyx paucidentis and Parajapyx isabellae was confirmed.
