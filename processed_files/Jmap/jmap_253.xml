Effects of Recreational Cabins, Trails and Their Removal for Restoration of Reindeer Winter Ranges.Conservation efforts have secured the partial recovery of Europe's wild reindeer, although only in 24 separate fragments of their original range, now separated by resorts and roads. Full recovery of the original range will require restoration of migration routes across developed or disturbed areas. We analyzed distribution of around 3500 <em>Rangifer tarandus tarandus</em> (reindeer) during winters (1984-2005) in relation to 10 alpine resorts and prior to and following relocation of ski trails and cabins in Norway done to restore use of former habitat.
