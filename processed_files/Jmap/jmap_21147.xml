Review of the Eospilarctia yuennanica group (Lepidoptera, Erebidae, Arctiinae) from the Indo â€“ Himalayan region, with description of two new species and one subspeciesAbstract Twonew Eospilarctia species and one new subspecies from China, Myanmar and Vietnam, respectively, are described. Superficially the new species Eospilarctia maciai sp. n., Eospilarctia naumanni sp. n. and Eospilarctia yuennanica fansipana ssp. n. resemble related congeners but they can be distinguished by the differences in wing pattern, genitalia and distribution provided. Eospilarctia yuennanica guangdonga Dubatolov, Kishida & Wang, 2008 is upgraded to species level. A checklist of the genus Eospilarctia and a key to the Eospilarctia yuennanica (Daniel, 1943) species-group, based on external characters and male genitalia, is presented.
