The South African Germplasm Collection of Groundnut, Arachis hypogaea L., and its utilityGroundnut is an important crop for both the commercial and developing farmer in South Africa, providing a source of plant protein and oil. Commercial production varies from 80 000 to 200 000 tons per annum. The only research institute in the country that is involved with groundnut breeding is the ARC Grain Crops Institute in Potchefstroom. This is also where the only groundnut germplasm collection in South Africa is stored, maintained and documented. The collection comprises 849 accessions which are renewed in a five year cycle. The collection is well documented and the characteristics of many of the accessions are recorded in detail. The collection has served as the genetic pool for the groundnut breeding program since the 1940s and has been the basis of all the commercially grown groundnut varieties in this country.
