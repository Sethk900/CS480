A new species of Fabricinuda Fitzhugh, 1990 (Fabriciinae: Sabellidae: Polychaeta) from the Caribbean, with an emendation of the genusDuring a survey of the infauna of seagrass meadows in Venezuela, several specimens of an unknown species of Fabriciinae were collected. The species could not be assigned to any genus of the subfamily, although it was most closely allied to Fabricinuda Fitzhugh, 1990. However, the absence of pseudospatulate inferior notochaetae on chaetiger 8 prevented assignment of the specimens to this genus since their presence on chaetigers 3 to 8 is one of its diagnostic apomorphies. In order to decide whether to establish a new genus for the species or to redefine Fabricinuda, a phylogenetic analysis of the subfamily was made on the basis of a preâ€existing character matrix. Twentyâ€two anatomical characters were analysed for 59 species including the new one, and from the resulting consensus tree it was clear that the new species must be included within Fabricinuda and consequently an emendation of the genus is provided herein.
