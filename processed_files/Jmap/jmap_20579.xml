An analysis of respiratory activity, Q(10), and microbial community composition of soils from high and low tussock sites at Toolik, AlaskaHigh latitude microbial communities, incurring increased global warming, are a potential major source of respiratory CO2 contributing to an enhanced greenhouse effect. Data on respiration and microbial density are presented for a moist, high tussock site compared with a low, water saturated site. The density of bacteria and eukaryotic microbes was nearly equivalent at both sites and potentially could yield substantial release of respiratory CO2 with continued warming. Respiratory rates for soil from the high site were greater than the low. The Q(10) of 2.4 for the high tussock sample was approximately 1.3 x that of the low site sample (Q(10) of 1.7).
