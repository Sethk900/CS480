Actividad locomotriz de Orchestoidea tuberculata (Amphipoda, Talitridae) sobre la superficie de una playa arenosa del Sur de Chile (Mehu√≠n, Provincia de Valdivia)Abstract With the purpose to know the diurnal and nocturnal activity of O. tuberculata on the surface of a sandy beach of Southern Chile (Mehu√≠n, Valdivia Province), 26 hours samples were made in the 1974 spring and 1975 summer and winter. Activity was measured by traps placed on transections between the cliff that limits posteriorly the beach and the low tide level. Each two hours the captured animals were taken and counted. Adults showed activity preferably in night hours, sub‚Äadults in sunset and night hours and youngs during the 24 hours dayreatest activity was registered in the summer samples and lowest in the winter samples. Nocturnal activity is interpreted as a means to avoid predators (littoral birds). This interpretation is applied preferably to adults. Also environmental condition (temperature, humidity) would have influence on the differences in activity between day and night. Differences between seasonal samples are interpreted in relation to the beach dynamical factors and to environmental factors.
