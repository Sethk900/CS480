Fractional determination of functional groups of humic acids by conductometric titrationThe conductometric replacement titration proposed in a previous report disclosed that the functional groups of humic acids are fractionated into three clusters of different dissociation constants, designated as VW, W and S clusters. In this paper, the method was examined to ascertain the relationship between the concentration of a sample and the amounts of fractionated clusters. The total amounts of fractionated clusters as well as the amount of the S cluster were directly proportional to the concentration of the sample, whereas the amount of the VW cluster decreased a little as concentration increased. The same method, applied to various types of humic acids in Japan, showed that the sums of the functional groups and the ratios of the S cluster to the sums likewise decreased in the order of A type > B and P types > Rp type. The total acidities determined by conductometry were nearly equal to the sums of carboxyl determined by Blom's method and phenolic hydroxyl determined by Folin's method.
