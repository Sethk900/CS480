Molecular size evaluation by gel filtration of humic acids from two sludges and from LeonharditeMolecular size distribution of humic acids on Sephadex gel from two sewage sludges, one aerobic and the other anaerobic, were compared with those from leonhardite. The humic acids had wider ranges of molecular sizes in the sludges than in the leonhardite. The size for the sludges ranged from less than 50,000 to more than 150,000 with a slight difference between the pair. For leonhardite the range extended from less than 50,000 to more than 100,000 but did not exceed 150,000. The difference between the sludges and leonhardite indicates greater complexity of humic acids in the former. The difference is attributed to the much longer period of humification for the leonhardite and possibly a less heterogeneous source material.
