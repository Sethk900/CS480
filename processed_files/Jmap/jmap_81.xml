Responses of heather moorland and Mediterranean mouflon foraging to prescribed-burning and cutting.We assessed the effects of prescribed burning and cutting on mouflon (<em>Ovis gmelini musimon</em>&times;<em>Ovis</em> sp.) spring habitat using an experimental design (17.28ha) of 2 burned, 2 cut, and 2 untreated plots within a homogeneous stand dominated by heather (<em>Erica cinerea</em> and <em>Calluna vulgaris</em>). Overall, we found a shift in treated plots from ligneous species to herbaceous species with high digestive and energetic values for mouflon. We also found a consistently higher number of mouflon feeding on these treated habitats compared to untreated plots. Such effects were still apparent 4 years after habitat modifications. Our approaches could be used by managers to improve and maintain the range of mouflon populations experiencing habitat loss (e.g., woody plant encroachment) and for which the condition of an animal has often a high economical value through trophy hunting.
