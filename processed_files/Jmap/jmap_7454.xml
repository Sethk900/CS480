Studies on Spirostreptoid Millipeds. XIII.Summary Exospermastix robustus Verhoeff, 1951 (Mato Grosso, nr Cuiaba) is regarded as a species of Urostreptus; the gonopods of the type specimen are illustrated and their structure discussed. The species is in many ways similar to U. camerani and U. paxillatus, but is much larger than either. The status of the generic and specific names Stenostreptus hassleri Carl is reviewed after a study of the type material, and the previous estimate of hassleri as a species of Urostreptus is reaffirmed. New drawings made from the lectotype of hassleri are given. The gonopods of a species identified as U. borelli by F. Silvestri, the author of that name, are illustrated, and the suggestion made that borelli may be found to be a senior synonym of hassleri.
