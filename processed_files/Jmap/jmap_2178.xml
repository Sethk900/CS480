Wood composition and energy content in a poplar short rotation plantation on fertilized agricultural land in a future CO2 atmosphere.To study the influence of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and nitrogen (N) fertilization on wood properties and energy, <em>Populus</em>&times;<em>euramericana</em> trees were exposed to ambient CO<sub>2</sub> (about 370 &mu;mol mol<sup>-;1</sup> CO<sub>2</sub>) or elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (about 550 &mu;mol mol<sup>-;1</sup> CO<sub>2</sub>) using Free Air CO<sub>2</sub> Enrichment (FACE) technology in combination with two N levels. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> was maintained for 5 years. After three growing seasons, the plantation was coppiced, one half of each experimental plot was fertilized and secondary sprouts were harvested after two growing seasons. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of wood revealed significant effects of both elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and N fertilization on wood chemistry, in particular, significant increases in lignin and decreases in N content. These results were corroborated by chemical analysis. Neither elevated CO<sub>2</sub> nor N fertilization affected the calorific value of wood, which was 19.3 MJ kg<sup>-;1</sup>. N fertilization enhanced the energy production per land area by 16-69% because of higher aboveground woody biomass production than on nonfertilized land. Estimates indicate that high yielding poplar short rotation cultivation may significantly contribute as an alternative feedstock for energy production.
