Ultrastructural changes caused by post-emergence herbicides in leaves of bengal wandering jew (Commelina benghalensis L.)The leaf surface morphology of C. benghalensis and the ultra structura I changes in C. benghalensis leaves caused by herbicide treatments in combination with adjuvants were studied with electron microscopes. The study indicated u It ra structural changes in treated leaves. All treatments caused changes in infrastructure in parenchyma cells. Three days after treatment, thylakoids in parenchyma cells were swollen and disrupted chloroplast envelopes were visible. The chloroplasts appeered swollen and were spherical in shape and also lacked starch grains.
