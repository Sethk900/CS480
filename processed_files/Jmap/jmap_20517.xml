Reconstruction of the depositional environment upstream of Potanin Glacier, Mongolian Altai, from pollen analysisThis study analyzed pollen in snow pits dug in September 2008 and September 2009 upstream of Potanin Glacier in the Mongolian Altai Mountains, which is a summer accumulation-type glacier, to investigate the environment for recent snow deposits. The snow pit observations in both years were carried out at sites 0 and 4, which are 3752 and 3890 m above sea level, respectively. Seasonal layers of the pits were identified according to the taxon of pollen scattered during different seasons. In the 2007 and 2008 layers, concentration peaks of pollen taxa scattered from spring to summer were found at the same depth. Thus, the summer melt reached the spring layer such that pollen grains in the melted layer became concentrated on the summer melt surface and caused the pollen peaks. In contrast, the concentration peaks associated with each season appeared at different depths in the 2009 layer, suggesting that the degree of melting in 2009 was less than that in 2007 and 2008. This interpretation was supported by summer temperature data (June–August) for this region. Deviations in summer air temperatures from mean monthly temperatures for the summers of 1990–2009 were negative in 2009, whereas they were positive in 2007 and 2008.
