Contrasting Activity Patterns of Sympatric and Allopatric Black and Grizzly BearsThe distribution of grizzly (Ursus arctos) and American black bears (U.\namericanus) overlaps in western North America. Few studies have detailed\nactivity patterns where the species are sympatric and no studies\ncontrasted patterns where populations are both sympatric and allopatric.\nWe contrasted activity patterns for sympatric black and grizzly bears\nand for black bears allopatric to grizzly bears, how human influences\naltered patterns, and rates of grizzly-black bear predation. Activity\npatterns differed between black bear populations, with those sympatric\nto grizzly bears more day-active. Activity patterns of black bears\nallopatric with grizzly bears were similar to those of female grizzly\nbears; both were crepuscular and day-active. Male grizzly bears were\ncrepuscular and night-active. Both species were more night-active and\nless day-active when <= 1 km from roads or developments. In our\nsympatric study area, 2 of 4 black bear mortalities were due to grizzly\nbear predation. Our results suggested patterns of activity that allowed\nfor intra-and inter-species avoidance. National park management often\nresults in convergence of locally high human densities in quality bear\nhabitat. Our data provide additional understanding into how bears alter\ntheir activity patterns in response to other bears and humans and should\nhelp park managers minimize undesirable bear-human encounters when\nconsidering needs for temporal and spatial management of humans and\nhuman developments in bear habitats.
