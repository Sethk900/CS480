Spiders on bark in a tropical rainforest (Panguana, Peru)Spiders found on bark in the Peruvian neotropics are listed (Table 1) and the occupation of a niche by spiders on bark is described. The most frequent spiders were pholcids (62 %), followed by pisaurids (13,5 %) and uloborids (9,5 %). The remaining 15 % spread over seven families. Webâ€building spiders like araneids, cyrtaucheniids, diplurids, pholcids, tetragnathids and uloborids were not bound to a certain type of bark. Ambushers like hersiliids, pisaurids and selenopids preferred smooth bark without vegetation. Salticids are found on rough bark as well as on smooth bark overgrown with epiphyts. Further ecological datas as diversity and abundance of spiders on trunks are discussed.
