Preliminary investigation on the potential of Clivia miniata Regel as a cut flowerClivia miniata Regel is widely cultivated as a garden ornamental and a pot plant. It occurs in many attractive shades of orange, red, yellow and pink but little information exists regarding its use as a cut flower. The possibility of picking cut flowers when all the flowers on the inflorescence are still closed and forcing flowers to open in distilled water and in Chrysal AKC™ was examined. A forcing temperature of 21 ± 2°C and an irradiance of 22 ± 3 μmol photons m2s−1 was used. After 190 hours, in both distilled water and Chrysal AKC™, more than 90% of flowers had opened and developed normal coloration. However, after 96 hours, 90% of inflorescences held in distilled water and 10% of those in Chrysal had developed peduncle splitting. The mechanism involved in the prevention of splitting is unknown but it is suspected that sucrose may have caused this.
