A review of the solitary entoprocts reported from sponges from Napoli (Italy), with designation of a neotype of Loxosoma pes Schmidt, 1878A number of solitary entoprocts were described from sponges found near the Stazione Zoologica, Napoli, at the end of the nineteenth century, but types are probably not existent. The identity of some of the species has been in doubt because the original descriptions are in some cases insufficient. Three species can be recognized with reasonable certainty, Loxosomella raja (Schmidt), L. cochlear (Schmidt) and L. tethyae (Salensky), whereas L. pes (Schmidt) is more or less unrecognizable, and L. alata (Barrois) is based on a misidentification. New material from Napoli has been identified as L. pes, which is redescribed and a neotype designated to secure the identity of the species.
