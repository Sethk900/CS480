Screening of some South African maize (Zea mays L.) cultivars for acetochlor toleranceAcetochlor containing a safener is registered for pre-emergence use on maize to control mainly annual grasses. It is applied at rates of between 0.49 and 1.89 kg ai ha-~ on soils with a clay content from <10% to 55%. Some cases of acetochlor injury to maize have occurred in the field despite the correct application rates being used. A randomised complete block design trial was conducted in a glasshouse set at 28/18°C day/night to screen 21 maize cultivars for their tolerance to acetochlor (WENNER 700 S EC®). Maize was planted in pots containing a sandy loam soil (15% clay). Five acetochlor rates (0, 0.74, 1.47, 2.94 and 5.88 kg ai ha ~) were applied the next day and leached into the soil. Characteristic symptoms of acetochlor phytotoxicity occurred, particularly at higher application rates. Most cultivars showed significant decreases in both plant height and dry mass at the recommended application rate. Significant differences were noted between cultivars, with slight variations in results for seedling height and dry mass. cultivars were grouped into tolerant, intermediate and sensitive classes based on their reaction to the herbicide. Most cultivars were rated as intermediate, although both tolerantand sensitive cultivars were found, so proving the existence of cultivar differences with respect to acetochlor tolerance.
