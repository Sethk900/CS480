Superparasitism of Eoxenos laboulbenei De Peyerimhoff (Strepsiptera: Mengenillidae) by Idiomacromerus gregarius (Silvestri) (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea) in southern SpainA female puparium of Eoxenos laboulbenei De Peyerimhoff (Strepsiptera: Insecta) found in Mula, Murcia, Spain was parasitized by five larvae of Idiomacromerus gregarius (Silvestri) (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea: Torymidae). The parasitized puparium was kept in the laboratory until the following summer, when four I. gregarius adults emerged from it. This species of chalcidoid is rarely found. It was first described in 1943 from Italy by Silvestri and the present report is the first record from Spain. Here we re-examine and redescribe the newly discovered specimens of I. gregarius, add further details about its morphology and give a brief account of its biology including a new record (the mengenillid E. laboulbenei).
