Effectiveness of Air Stripping, Advanced Oxidation, and Activated Carbon Adsorption-Coupled Process in Treating Chlorinated Solvent–Contaminated GroundwaterAbstractChlorinated solvents are the most prevalent organic contaminants in groundwater because of their extensive and widespread use as cleaning agents and metal degreasers, and they have become a significant threat to groundwater supplies. Groundwater contamination by chlorinated solvents has proven difficult and costly to remedy because of the physicochemical properties of the solvents. This study was conducted to examine the effectiveness of treating contaminated groundwater containing chlorinated solvents using air stripping, advanced oxidation, and activated carbon adsorption processes. The results showed that the stripping instrument could effectively transfer chlorinated solvents into the gas phase within several minutes at an airflow rate of 5.0  L/min and a temperature of 298 K. The residual chlorinated solvents were further oxidized into harmless by-products by the subsequent O3/H2O2 process, and the off-gas generated from the previously-mentioned processes were collected and absorbed by four types of activated carbon [i.e., Shanghai coconut, Shanghai fruit, Taixi coal (12*40) and Taixi ZJ-15 (cylinder)]. Shanghai coconut exhibited the greatest adsorption capacity, at 0.5  g/g. Two types of contaminated groundwater containing chlorinated solvents from contaminated sites were successfully treated by the coupled process at bench scale with the effluent concentrations of chlorinated solvents complying with the target values standard for groundwater regulated by the Dutch Ministry of Public Housing. Overall, the study found that the proposed coupled process is a viable method for efficiently and effectively remediating shallow contaminated groundwater containing chlorinated solvents in southern China.
