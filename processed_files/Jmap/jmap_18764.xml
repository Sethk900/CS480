Comparative soil CO2 evolution, litter decay, and root dynamics in clearcut and uncut spruce-fir forestAn investigation was conducted in a northern spruce-fir forest to examine the impact of forest clearcutting on soil CO2 efflux, litter decay, and root dynamics in the first year following harvesting. During a 6-month sampling period from May-November, clearcut plots released 16% more carbon dioxide than did uncut spruce-fir reference plots. Aboveground litterfall was much greater in the uncut site: however, unit decay rates for O-i horizon surface litter in cut and uncut sites were similar. Thus, excess CO2 efflux from the harvested site did not result from increased decomposition of litter and forest floor organic matter. Fine root(less than or equal to 3 mm) biomass and necromass varied over the sampling period between cut and uncut sites, and live root biomass declined steeply over the growing season in the clearer plots. Fine root decomposition in the O horizon of harvested plots equalled 35% of the initial standing crop of fine root biomass + necromass in the forest floor of the cut site, and accounted for about one-third of total soil CO2 efflux from the clearcut site during the study period.
