Restoration Ecology of an Endangered Plant Species: Establishment of New Populations of Cirsium pitcheri.We determined the effects of shade, burial by sand, simulated herbivory, and fertilizers on the survival and growth of artificially planted population of <em>Cirsium pitcheri</em>-an endangered plant species of the sand dunes along Lake Huron. Sand burial experiments showed that greenhouse grown plants should optimally be transplanted into areas receiving 5 cm of sand deposition: burial at this depth maximized emergence, survivorship, and below-ground biomass. Under field conditions, simulated herbivory of up to 50% of the plant height produced a slight increase in biomass after one year of growth. Field observations showed that when white-tailed deer removed more than 50% of the transplant's leaf tissue, the plant died. The application of a 20:20:20 (N:P:K) water-soluble fertilizer produced a significant increase in the dry leaf biomass, total leaf area, and total dry biomass relative to control plants. We also tested for the presence or absence of a persistent seed bank. Few seeds were recovered from soil samples collected from Pinery Provincial Park and Providence Bay. However, <em>C. pitcheri</em> has the ability to form a persistent seed bank under field conditions but only at soil depths of â‰¥15 cm. <em>Cirsium pitcheri</em> seeds are able to germinate and seedlings can emerge from a burial depth of up to 6 cm. Thus, seeds planted in open, sunny areas will probably maximize emergence, growth, and survivorship of seedlings. Populations of <em>C. pitcheri</em> can be restored by planting seeds at shallow depths, transplanting greenhouse-grown plants, applying water soluble fertilizers, and protecting plants from herbivores.
