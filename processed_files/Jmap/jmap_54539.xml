Equilibrium and kinetic controls on the subsurface migration of radioactive contaminantsIntegrated experiments were designed in order to identify key chemical controls on the migration of 237Np and 241Am in natural systems. The methodology used includes many independent tests using site-specific porous materials taken at various potential disposal sites. Differences in the observed patterns are discussed and interpreted in terms of a different chemical speciation of radionuclides and redox conditions. Description of the experimental data was found to improve by combining a kinetic and an equilibrium model.
