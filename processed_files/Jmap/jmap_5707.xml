Systematic review of the land snail genus Neocepolis Pilsbry, 1891 (Pulmonata: Camaenidae) from north VietnamBy examination of the shell, radula and genital morphology and comparison with type material of the two known species, we reassess the status of Neocepolis Pilsbry, 1891, a poorly known genus of Vietnamese camaenids. Previously recognised solely on the basis of shell characters, we identify features of genital morphology that confirm the specific status of Neocepolis meracha (Mabille, 1888) and N. morleti (Dautzenberg and d'Hamonville, 1887) and the validity of Neocepolis as a distinct genus within a clade that includes Camaena and Camaena (Camaenella).
