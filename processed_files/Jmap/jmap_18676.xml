DETRITAL ORGANIC-MATTER AND SOIL CO2 EFFLUX IN FORESTS REGENERATING FROM CUTTING IN WEST-VIRGINIAMeasures of forest floor, soil organic matter, fine roots, and soil CO2 efflux were made on regrowing hardwood forests ranging in age from 6 months to 23 yr (cuts) and compared with measures from uncut forests (controls) to determine if detrital organic matter is lost following cutting and to estimate the period over which loss occurs. Mean organic matter contents of the forest floor were 35% lower on the cuts compared to the controls. The loss of forest floor was rapid during the first 10 yr following cutting with minimal change to year 23. No overall difference was observed between cuts and controls with respect to organic matter content of the soil A horizon (to a 10 cm depth) or live or dead root masses. On the cuts < 10 yr old, CO2 efflux was 13% higher and soil temperatures were 6% higher than their controls indicating that the loss of forest floor was a result of increased decomposition. Detrital organic matter in the forest floor and mineral soil was 873 g m-2 lower on the cuts which was equal to 11% of the total detrital organic matter in the profile.
