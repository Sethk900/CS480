The female genitalia of Gonioctena, subgenus Spartoxena (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)The taxonomy of the eight species of Gonioctena Chevrolat belonging to the subgenus Spartoxena Motschulsky is mostly based on male genitalia due to the unsuitability of external characters (i.e. coloration patterns) for identification. In order to provide similar diagnostic characters for both genders, the female genitalia of the eight species are described and illustrated. Considering the lack of spermathecae within the genus, the shapes of tergite 8, and sternites 8 and 9 have been explored as possible diagnostic characters. These structures present marked differences between taxa and simultaneously stability among individuals of each species, and thus they are very useful for taxonomic purposes. A key to the females of the subgenus Spartoxena is provided, and figures of tergite 9, and sternites 8 and 9 of each species are included.
