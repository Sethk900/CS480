A review of the genus Gibbasilus Londt, 1986 in southern Africa (Diptera, Asilidae)Gibbasilus Londt, 1986, a small genus of asiline Asilidae endemic to the Western Cape Province of South Africa, is taxonomically revised. Three species are described for the first time (alboala, condylus, crinitus) and added to those already known (arenaceus, brevicolis, centrolobus). A key for the identification of species is provided. Little is known of their biology, but a close association with species of Restionaceae, a dominant element of the Cape Floristic Region, has been observed. It is suspected that females, which possess long, laterally compressed, knife-like ovipositors, use these plants as oviposition sites.
