Estimation of soil clay and calcium carbonate using laboratory, field and airborne hyperspectral measurementsThis paper examines how reflectance spectrometry used in the laboratory to estimate clay and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) soil contents can be applied to field and airborne measurements for soil property mapping. A continuum removal (CR) technique quantifying specific absorption features of clay (2206Â nm) and CaCO3 (2341Â nm) was applied to laboratory, field and airborne HYMAP reflectance measurements collected in 2003 (33 sites) and 2005 (19 sites) over bare soil sites of a few meters within the La Peyne Valley area, southern France. Nine intermediate stages from the laboratory up to HYMAP sensor measurements were considered for separately evaluating the possible degradation of estimation performances when going across scales and sensors, e.g. radiometric calibration, spectral resolution, spatial variability, illumination conditions, and surface status including roughness, soil moisture and presence and nature of pebbles.Significant relationships were observed between clay and CaCO3 contents and CR values computed respectively at 2206Â nm and 2341Â nm from reflectance measurements at the laboratory level with an ASD spectrophotometer up to the HYMAP spectro-imaging sensor. Performances of clay and CaCO3 estimations decreased from the laboratory to airborne scales. The main factors inducing uncertainties in the estimates were radiometric and wavelength calibration uncertainties of the HYMAP sensor as well as possible residual atmospheric effects.
