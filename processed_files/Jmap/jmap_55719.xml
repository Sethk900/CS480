Prediction of vertical soil organic carbon profiles using soil properties and environmental tracer data at an untilled siteSoil organic carbon (SOC) has considerable spatial and temporal variability both at the hillslope and catchment scale as well as down the soil profile. In recent years the distribution of SOC down the soil profile has become an area of interest in the understanding of the carbon sequestration potential of soils. Most studies however have concentrated on highly disturbed agricultural sites with little data available for untilled locations. In this study the vertical distribution of SOC is examined at a grassland site in the Young River area of Western Australia that has remained undisturbed by human activity for 50 years. Soil physical properties (texture, rock content) as well as the distribution of the environmental tracers 137Cs and 210Pb were assessed with the aim of better understanding the transport processes which produce the observed vertical distribution of SOC. While no consistent relationship was found between SOC and soil physical properties significant relationships were found between the distribution of SOC and the environmental tracers, 137Cs and 210Pb. Finite element simulations based on a diffusion/convection/decay model showed that the transport of 137Cs and 210Pb down the soil profile is likely to be driven by the same (primarily diffusive) processes. The same model used in conjunction with plant input and decay data generated from the RothC-26.3 soil carbon model revealed that transport of SOC down the soil profile, while also a diffusion process, was significantly slower indicating that different processes and/or pathways are involved in SOC transport at this site.
