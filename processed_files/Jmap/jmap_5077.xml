A new species of the genus Beameria (Hemiptera: Cicadidae) from North AmericaCicadas of the genus Beameria Davis are small, grass dwelling species found across much of western North America. We provide the first detailed description of the genus and describe the new species Beameria ansercollis sp. nov. Sanborn and M. Heath with this work. The morphology, biogeography, song parameters and thermal tolerances of the new and known species of Beameria are described and comparisons between the species are made. There are significant statistical differences in morphology, song parameters and thermal tolerances between the species of the genus. The biogeography of all species is illustrated. A key to the species of Beameria is provided.
