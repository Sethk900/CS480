Population dynamics of Pseudocalanus minutus elongatus in the Gulf of Gdansk (southern Baltic Sea) – experimental and numerical resultsThe seasonal and spatial distribution of the pelagic calanoid copepod Pseudocalanus minutus elongatus was studied in the Gulf of Gdansk (southern Baltic Sea) between January 2006 and December 2007 based on experimental data (from six stations) and numerical simulations. Numerical calculations were performed using a structured zooplankton population model that was adapted to this species and coupled to the ecosystem model. Spatiotemporal distribution of this species depends on salinity as a masking factor. Highest abundances at station J23, an open sea site, were observed in July 2006 and March 2007 (10,050 and 11,000 ind. m−3, respectively) and resulted from the large numbers of earlier copepodites C1–C3 in 2006 and nauplii in 2007. In shallow stations abundances declined. Our results show that only one complete generation of this copepod species developed during the year in this region. Differences in development between the experimental and numerical data are analysed.
