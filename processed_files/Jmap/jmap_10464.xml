Effect of sea salt and l-ascorbic acid on the seed germination of halophytesEffects of l-ascorbic acid and sea salt solutions on the seed germination of Atriplex stocksii, Arthrocnemum macrostachyum, Haloxylon stocksii, Suaeda fruticosa, Desmostachya bipinnata and Aeluropus lagopoides were studied. Increasing concentration of sea salt inhibited seed germination of all species with comparatively more adverse effect on A. stocksii and S. fruticosa than others. Pretreatment of seeds with l-ascorbic acid alleviated the sea salt effects only in these species, i.e. A. stocksii and S. fruticosa, where as A. macrostachyum, H. stocksii, D. bipinnata and A. lagopoides remained unaffected. This indicates the variability of metabolic responses to salinity effects during seed germination.
