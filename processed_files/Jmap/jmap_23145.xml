Three new species of the genus Probles Förster (Hymenoptera, Ichneumonidae, Tersilochinae) from South KoreaAbstract Three closely related species of the genus Probles Förster, P. fulgida sp. n., P. korusa sp. n. and P. rukora sp. n., belong to the subgenus Euporizon Horstmann and differ from other Palearctic species of the genus by a combination of long and apically weakly sinuate ovipositor and short temple. These three species are assigned to a newly designated fulgida species-group, and a portion of the key for identification of this species-group is provided. Based on the shape of the ovipositor apex, the fulgida species-group resemble members of the subgenus Microdiaparsis Horstmann but are distinct in having a much shorter temple.
