Automated Linear and Nonlinear Reservoir Approaches for Estimating Annual Base FlowAbstractThree automated base flow separation techniques based on linear and nonlinear reservoir approaches are used to identify the seasonal variation of base flow and to quantify the annual base flow for three subwatersheds of the Essex region in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. Significant differences in annual base flow estimated by linear and nonlinear reservoir algorithms are observed. In the nonlinear reservoir approach, the recession parameter is considered to be a seasonally variable parameter. The nonlinear reservoir approach fits streamflow recession better than the linear reservoir approach. The steeper slopes of seasonal flow duration curves in the 90% to 100% flow exceedance range show that the groundwater contribution to streamflow is relatively small in the study area. The precipitation-streamflow relationships show faster response of base flow during the period of high recharge. All of the methods show similar base flow estimation during the period of high evapotranspiration losses. The nonlinear reservoir approach represents the base flow response to precipitation better than the other methods. Therefore, the annual base flow estimated by the nonlinear reservoir approach is considered as the most reasonable estimation for the formulation of water budget of the study area. The method quantifies the occurrence of average annual baseflow as 34% of average annual streamflow.
