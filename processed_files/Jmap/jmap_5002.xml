Three abdominal parasitic isopods (Isopoda: Epicaridea: Bopyridae: Athelginae) on hermit crabs from China and Hong KongThree bopyrid isopods of the subfamily Athelginae parasitizing hermit crabs collected in Chinese waters are discussed and described in this paper. Athelges takanoshimensis Ishii, 1914 is recorded again from China on Pagurus pectinatus (Stimpson) and from Hong Kong on a new host, Pagurus minutus Hess. Parathelges enoshimensis Shiino, 1950 is recorded for the first time from China on a member of the genus Spiropagurus. Pseudostegias setoensis Shiino, 1933 is recorded again from Hong Kong but from a new host, Clibanarius virescens Hess, and for the first time from Hainan Province on a new host Calcinus laevimanus (Randall). A combination of light and scanning electron microscopy is used to investigate the morphology of these species and data on their prevalence with hermit crab hosts are provided.
