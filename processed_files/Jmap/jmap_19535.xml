Effects of simulated nitrogen deposition on soil respiration in a Neosinocalamus affinis plantation in Rainy Area of West ChinaFrom December 2007 to November 2008, an in situ experiment was conducted to study the effects of simulated nitrogen deposition on the soil respiration in a Neosinocalamus affinis plantation in Rainy Area of West China. Four treatments were installed, i.e., 0 (CK), 50, 150, and 300 kg N . hm(-2) . a(-1), and soil respiration rate was measured by infrared gas analyzer. In the test plantation, soil respiration rate had a distinct seasonal fluctuation, with the highest (3.36 +/- 0.20 mu mol . m(-2) . s(-1)) by the end of July and the lowest by the end of February (0.33 +/- 0.07 mu mol . m(-2) . s(-1)). There was a significant exponential relationship (P<0.001) between soil respiration rate and soil temperature, and the temperature at 10 cm soil depth explained 91.6% of the seasonal change of soil respiration. However, less relationship was observed between soil respiration rate and soil moisture content (R-2 = 0.0758). From June to November 2008, the contribution of root respiration to total soil respiration ranged from 46% to 59%. The annual release amount of CO2 in treatments 50, 150, and 300 kg . hm(-2) a(-1) was 23.6%, 46.7%, and 50.5% lower than that in CK (2.17 x 10(4) kg . hm(-2)), and the Q(10) value of soil respiration rate in treatments 0, 50, 150, and 300 kg . hm(-2) . a(-1) was 3.72, 3.51, 2.95, and 2.71, respectively.
