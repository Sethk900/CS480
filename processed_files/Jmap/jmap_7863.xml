Vegetation effects on sediment connectivity and processes in an ephemeral channel in SE SpainHigh sediment delivery due to catchment and channel erosion can impact on waterway health and reservoir sedimentation. Methods that decrease sediment connectivity within the system are needed to address these potential impacts. Vegetation has the potential to decrease channel erosion and sediment transfers in dryland environments by increasing channel bed resistance and roughness. Detailed studies of vegetation and process interactions were undertaken within an ephemeral channel in SE Spain at three scales (channel network, reach and patch) by repeat surveys and mapping after floods. Connectivity mapping showed variations in vegetation type and density along the channel and that these influence sediment retention and channel erosion. Hydraulic calculations of vegetation roughness effects at 25 cross-sections down the channel indicate the influence of different vegetation type and characteristics. Particular attention was paid to the perennial grass Lygeum spartum because of its potential benefits in channel stabilisation. Sedimentation takes place within these reaches, mainly by trapping within and downstream of individual plants. Check dams have a profound influence on vegetation and sediment distribution in this channel but use of vegetated zones may be a more sustainable strategy of sediment control.
