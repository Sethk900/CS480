The joint Swire Institute of Marine Science, Hong Kong, and Natural History Museum, London, Hong Kong Submarine Caves Expedition, 2002: introductionAn investigation of two subtidal caves in the eastern exposed waters of Hong Kong was undertaken in 2002. The geological context and the physical parameters of the cave environments are described. The caves, or zawns, occurring at depths of between −9.3 to −12.4 m C.D. and −1.8 to −18.2 m C.D. at Steep Island and Conic Island, respectively, were probably created at a time of lowered sea levels during the last ice age >19,000 years ago. The caves have subsequently been drowned and each now possesses a floor that is covered in muddy sand. The present paper sets the context for the range of taxonomic and ecological studies undertaken during the 2002 Hong Kong Marine Caves Expedition.
