A diallel study of yield differences among six well-adapted semi-dwarf spring wheatsA diallel study of the variability for yield that remained after an effort to exclude some of the factors known to contribute strongly to yield variation in the Winter Rainfall Region, was done. Overdominance resulted in strong heterosis effects which persisted in the F2. Little or no additive variation was expressed across the five environments sampled, while highly significant specific combining ability effects were evident.
