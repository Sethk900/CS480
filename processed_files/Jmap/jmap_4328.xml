Phytochemical content, antioxidant capacity and physicochemical properties of pomegranate grown in different microclimates in South AfricaWe investigated the antioxidant and physicochemical properties of pomegranate (Punica granatum cv. Bhagwa) fruit grown in three microclimates in South Africa. The physicochemical properties of fruit peel and arils differed among the growing locations, including weight and redness color of both peel and arils. Contents of vitamin C, anthocyanin and total phenolics were 0.67–1.41 mg ml−1, 0.07–0.16 mg ml−1 and 8.54–13.91 mg ml−1, respectively. Fruit grown in locations with high light intensity had higher vitamin C content and lower phenolic content than those of fruit from low-altitude locations and high light intensity. The pH of juice did not significantly differ among locations, whereas significant variation was observed in total soluble solids (TSS), titratible acidity (TA) and TSS:TA ratio. Fruit from locations with low rainfall had high TSS and low TA. Principal component analysis was used successfully to classify fruit by growing location on the basis of antioxidant and phytochemical contents.
