Haploids in barley breedingHaploids are organisms which possess the gametic chromosome number in their somatic tissues. They may arise spontaneously or be induced in a number of ways. Since 1970 haploids have been used as a method of producing pure lines in barley breeding. In this study it was found that the matemal genotype influences the number of haploids produced from the interspecific cross with Hordeum bulbosum L. The results of crosses on pure cultivars are not, however, a reliable criterion for the choice of parents for matemal F1 hybrids. The application of haploid technology in barley breeding in South Africa is discussed.
