Changes in glacier extent in the eastern Pamir, Central Asia, determined from historical data and ASTER imageryHistorical surveys and recent satellite imagery are used to map and assess glacier recession in the eastern Pamir over the last three decades. For this study we used topographic maps of 1:100000 scales published in 1943 and 1970; air photos from 1978 and 1990; space images: from Russian satellites in 1972, 1978, 1980, and 1990 and ASTER data for 2001. Climatic records from the Ã¢Â€ÂœFedtchenkoÃ¢Â€Â glacier station (4156Ã‚Â m a.s.l., 38.83Ã‚Â°N, 72.22Ã‚Â°E) and Ã¢Â€ÂœMurgabÃ¢Â€Â meteorological station (3576Ã‚Â m a.s.l., 38.17Ã‚Â°N, 73.97Ã‚Â°E) are used for analysis of the climate conditions in the region.Changes in the area of 5Ã‚Â glaciers and terminus positions of 44Ã‚Â glaciers in the eastern Pamir reveal an accelerating trend since the end of the 1970s through 2001, as a continuation of glacier wastage and retreat since, at least, the end of the Little Ice Age. The glacier area decreased 7.8% during 1978Ã¢Â€Â“1990, and 11.6% in 1990Ã¢Â€Â“2001. This corresponds with documented changes in other mountain and subpolar regions in the Northern Hemisphere and specifically in Central Asia. Glacier changes in the eastern Pamir are a response to increasing summer temperatures. We find decreases in glacier area and retreat of glacier fronts, increased debris-covered area and the appearance of new lakes.
