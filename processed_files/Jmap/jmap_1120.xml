Early Successional Patterns and Potential Facilitation of Woody Plant Colonization by Rotting Logs in Premontane Costa Rican Pastures.We examined the size, species, location (x and y coordinates), and microsite inhabited by colonizing trees and shrubs in five abandoned pastures in southern Costa Rica. All woody stems greater than 1 m tall in the pastures were measured and mapped, from the overhanging forest edge to 50 m into the abandoned pasture. Species composition of colonists differed substantially among pastures: <em>Croton draco</em> (Euphorbiaceae) dominated one site, two species of <em>Miconia</em> (Melastomataceae) another site, and <em>Verbesina tapentiensis</em> (Asteraceae) a third site. Site 4 had the highest cover of rotting logs (11%), and a four-fold greater density of colonizing woody plants than the site with the next highest colonist density. For all species pooled, and for several individual taxa, density was positively correlated across sites with abundance of log microsites.
