Root-Derived Contributions to Soil Respiration as Influenced by Agricultural Management SystemsAgricultural management practices have the potential to significantly alter soil C storage through changes in C inputs and losses. Plant roots represent a significant, but poorly understood source of C inputs. Corn (Zea mays L.) root C was (13)C-labeled in a field experiment to examine the effects of tillage and fertilization, crop rotation diversity, and fertilizer type on root-derived C cycling in Mollisols in the Upper Midwest. Daily and cumulative root-derived C emissions, their contribution to total soil respiration, and the turnover of root-derived C were quantified during the soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] phase of crop rotations. Over two growing seasons, the average corn root-derived contribution to cumulative soil C emissions was 8.5%, and on average 35% of the initial root-derived C was respired. Environmental conditions were the primary control over daily root-derived C emissions, but management system effects on cumulative growing season emissions were evident. In both seasons organic fertilization led to lower cumulative root-derived emissions and root-derived contributions to cumulative C emissions than synthetic fertilization. In 2005, more intense tillage and synthetic fertilization positively affected cumulative root-derived C emissions and the root-derived fraction of cumulative soil C emissions (moldboard > chisel plow). Root-derived C turnover was negatively affected by rotation diversity in 2006 (2-yr > 4-yr rotation). We suggest that rotation diversity has an important influence on soil C storage and root-derived C turnover through effects on the quantity of root-derived C inputs.
