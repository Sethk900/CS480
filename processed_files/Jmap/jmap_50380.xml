New method for visualization of C-heterochromatin in synaptonemal complex spreadsDAPI staining of the metaphase chromosomes pretreated with barium hydroxide generates a C-like banding pattern. In this work a protocol for visualizing similar pattern at the synaptonemal complex (SC) spreads after immunostaining is suggested. This method was used to visualize centromeric and sex heterochromatin at the SC spreads of guppy fish (Poecilia reticulata Peters, 1859). The efficiency of this method was further confirmed at SC spreads of the northern red-backed vole (Myodes rutilus (Pallas, 1779)), the guinea pig (Cavia porcellus (Linnaeus, 1758)), and the pigmy shrew (Sorex minutus Linnaeus, 1766).
