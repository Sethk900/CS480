Trends in volume migration chronology in spring staging Pacific black brantWe used a robust dataset of count and mark-resighting data for Pacific black brant from 19892004, and a novel mark-recapture model capable of analyzing such data, to calculate the annual variability and timing of brant as they migrated through the ParksvilleQualicum Beach area, a traditional spring staging site in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Our analysis indicated that the date of departure from this site to northern breeding sites advanced between 10 and 20 days over this period because of a combination of earlier arrival and shorter residence times. Given this change in migration behavior, and the potential implications for population dynamics, we recommend that targeted research on brant wintering, migration, and reproductive strategies should be examined within a greater Pacific-wide context. In this way, the consequences of proximate factors (e.g., disturbance, food, and climate) can be understood in terms of individual fitness and population dynamics. Finally, at the local level, conservation actions are needed to ensure the long term sustainability of ParksvilleQualicum Beach as an important spring staging site for Pacific black brant.
