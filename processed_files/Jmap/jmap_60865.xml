Evaluation of MODIS SWIR and NIR-SWIR atmospheric correction algorithms using SeaBASS dataUsing the NASA maintained ocean optical and biological in situ data that were collected during 2002â2005, we have evaluated the performance of atmospheric correction algorithms for the ocean color products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Aqua. Specifically, algorithms using the MODIS shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands and an approach using the near-infrared (NIR) and SWIR combined method are evaluated, compared to the match-up results from the NASA standard algorithm (using the NIR bands). The in situ data for the match-up analyses were collected mostly from non-turbid ocean waters. It is critical to assess and understand the algorithm performance for deriving MODIS ocean color products, providing science and user communities with the important data quality information. Results show that, although the SWIR method for data processing has generally reduced the bias errors, the noise errors are increased due mainly to significantly lower sensor signal-noise ratio (SNR) values for the MODIS SWIR bands, as well as the increased uncertainties using the SWIR method for the atmospheric correction. This has further demonstrated that future ocean color satellite sensors will require significantly improved sensor SNR performance for the SWIR bands. The NIRâSWIR combined method, for which the non-turbid and turbid ocean waters are processed using the NIR and SWIR method, respectively, has been shown to produce improved ocean color products.
