Systematics of the parasitic wasp genus Oxyscelio Kieffer (Hymenoptera, Platygastridae s.l.), part III: African faunaAfrican species of Oxyscelio (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae s.l.) are revised. A total of 14 species are recognized, 13 of which are described as new: O. absentiae Burks, sp. n., O. galeri Burks, sp. n., O. gyri Burks, sp. n., O. idoli Burks, sp. n., O. intensionis Burks, sp. n., O. io Burks, sp. n., O. kylix Burks, sp. n., O. lunae Burks, sp. n., O. nemesis Burks, sp. n., O. pulveris Burks, sp. n., O. quassus Burks, sp. n., O. teli Burks, sp. n. and O. xenii Burks, sp. n. The genus Freniger Szabó, syn. n. is recognized as part of an endemic African species group of Oxyscelio with incomplete hind wing venation, and O. bicolor (Szabó), comb. n. is therefore recognized as the only previously described species of Oxyscelio from Africa. The O. crateris and O. cuculli species groups, previously known from southeast Asia, are represented in Africa by seven and one species respectively.
