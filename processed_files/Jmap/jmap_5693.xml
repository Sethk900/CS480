Diet and feeding behaviour of the Neotropical parrot snake (Leptophis ahaetulla) in northern BrazilSpecimens (289) of Leptophis ahaetulla from northern Brazil and western MaranhÃ£o were examined for the composition of stomach contents. Most prey items were tree frogs, especially those of the family Hylidae (90%). Most of the anurans identified belong to the Scinax ruber species group (27%) and Scinax sp. (25%). Prey size was significantly related to snake length but not to head length. There was no significant difference related to sex in either case. Both sexes preyed on small to mediumâ€sized items (3â€“10% of snake snoutâ€“vent length). Leptophis ahaetulla seems to manipulate captured prey before ingestion since most of the prey items (83.6%) were swallowed headâ€first. Leptophis ahaetulla is primarily diurnal and semiâ€arboreal, inhabits disturbed and undisturbed forest, and forages primarily on the ground and in fallen vegetation, where its prey items are likely to be found at rest. â€ In memoriam.
