A new milliped of the Genus Chonodesmus, with a proposed reclassification of the family Cryptodesmidae (Diplopoda, Polydesmida)Summary Chonodemus gervaisi, n. sp., is described from San Agust√≠n, Colombia. The genus Chonodesmus in many ways provides a link between the three nominal families Cryptodesmidae, Pterodesmidae, and Peridontodesmidae, and it is proposed that the three be combined into a single taxon, Cryptodesmidae, with the other two names retained for subordinate groups. A provisional classification of the family is suggested, including generic synonymy, and the new tribes Lampodesmini, Ophrydes‚Ämini, Dyakryptini, and Trichopeltini are proposed. The family name Otodesmidae is reduced to subfamily rank, and the name Niponiellidae reduced to tribal status. A key is provided for four West African genera of the subfamily Pterodesminae.
