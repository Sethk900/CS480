Environmental changes over the past c. 29,000 years in the Middle Atlas (Morocco): A record from Lake Ifrah.A borehole core from Lake Ifrah (Middle Atlas, Morocco) provided a unique, continuous record of environmental change spanning the past c. 29,000 years cal BP (29 ka). A study of its organic matter, carbonates and magnetic susceptibility allowed us to reconstruct past climate changes and their impact on the lake's catchment area.
