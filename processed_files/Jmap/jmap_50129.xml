Bird community characteristics as indicators of sustainable management in olive grove ecosystems of Central GreeceThe role of breeding birds as indicators of sustainable management in olive groves was investigated. The data revealed significantly higher alpha diversity in organic and abandoned olive groves and maquis than in conventional ones. The highest beta diversity was found between the following pairs: organic olive groves–maquis, and abandoned olive groves–maquis. Breeding bird diversity, Heteroptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera and Coleoptera densities positively influenced bird species richness in organic olive groves and maquis, and additionally, manure application positively influenced bird species richness in organic ones. Bird species richness was negatively influenced by pesticide and inorganic fertilizer application in conventional ones. Moreover, isopod density was unimportant in explaining breeding bird richness in organic olive groves. Finally, our study suggests a difference in bird communities of various olive groves as a result of different management and practices, and concludes that birds might serve as indicators of overall olive grove health. Furthermore, these findings could be used as a tool for prediction of breeding bird species richness probability in different olive grove management systems and maquis. Finally, the results of the present study may contribute to highlighting some aspects of the effect of different farming practices on the dynamics of Mediterranean bird communities.
