The Potential of Cephalophyllum inaequale (L. Bolus) for the Restoration of Degraded Arid Landscapes in Namaqualand, South Africa.The potential of <em>Cephalophyllum inaequale</em> was investigated for use in initiating ecosystem restoration in degraded landscapes of Namaqualand, South Africa. <em>Cephalophyllum inaequale</em>, a perennial shrub, is a member of the succulent Mesembryanthemaceae family, typical of the Succulent Karoo Biome and in particular of the Namaqualand area. A bioclimatic envelope was modeled to establish the area in which this species might feasibly be used. The regional bioclimatic potential for <em>C. inaequale</em> proved to be extensive, covering approximately 17,500 km<sup>2</sup>. An examination of the functional role of <em>C. inaequale</em> showed it to facilitate early seedling survival in this community. A nearest-neighbor study found no evidence of interspecific competition between <em>C. inaequale</em> and its dominant co-occurring species, possibly due to vertical stratification of rooting structures. <em>Cephalophyllum inaequale</em> significantly reduced wind speed and soil erosion. Experiments to test the feasibility of propagating, reintroducing, and establishing this species showed that it easily germinates from seed, and transplanted cuttings have a high survival rate. This study demonstrates that <em>C. inaequale</em> has potential for use in initiating the restoration of degraded lands in South Africa
