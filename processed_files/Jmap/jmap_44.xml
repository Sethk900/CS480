In situ persistence of African wild olive and forest restoration in degraded semiarid savanna.The ability to produce vegetative shoots is a form of persistence in arid and semiarid savannas allowing trees to survive herbivory, fire and cutting. In terms of growth rates and survival, this form of rejuvenation may be more successful than recruitment via seed rain or dormant seeds in the seed bank. For this reason, resprouting could play an important role in the tree canopy and forest microclimate recovery and forest succession.
