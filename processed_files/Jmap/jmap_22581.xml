Allophylastrum: a new genus of Sapindaceae from northern South AmericaAbstract The new genus Allophylastrum (Sapindaceae) is described from Roraima, Brazil and Guyana. Allophylastrum resembles the genus Allophylus in its vegetative morphology but differs by its apetalous flowers with a cupular nectary disc, 5â€“6 unequal stamens, and 4- to 5- porate pollen grains. A key is provided to differentiate Allophylastrum from Allophylus. The new species Allophylastrum frutescens is described and illustrated.
