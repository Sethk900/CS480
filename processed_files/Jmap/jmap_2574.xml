HERBIVORY LIMITS RECRUITMENT IN AN OLD-FIELD SEED ADDITION EXPERIMENT.Environmental variability can promote coexistence by creating establishment sites for rare plants, but low diversity in anthropogenic grasslands suggests that this variability may be eliminated (homogenization hypothesis) or inaccessible (barrier hypothesis). We explore these alternatives on the northern Great Plains, where 11 million hectares have been transformed by multiple environmental changes, but the causes of species loss are unclear. In a degraded grassland, we increased environmental variability by manipulating competition and herbivory along gradients of fertility and disturbance, and we circumvented dispersal barriers by adding 1.2 million seeds of five functionally distinct species at varying densities. The experiment ended after 12 weeks due to the direct and indirect effects of unapparent small native herbivores, which were barriers to population establishment by the added species. The direct cause of recruitment failure was browsing. The indirect cause was associated with competition from invasive plants that appeared to be more tolerant or resistant to herbivory. Variability in fertility, disturbance, propagule pressure, and competition had relatively minor impacts on colonization by the added species because herbivores controlled recruitment in most environments. Recruitment outside the herbivore exclosures was mostly by unpalatable exotics, suggesting a possible link between invasion success and herbivore resistance for some introduced plants.
