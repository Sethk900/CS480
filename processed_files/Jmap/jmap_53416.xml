Impacts of fire severity and post-fire reforestation on carbon pools in boreal larch forests in Northeast ChinaBoreal larch (Larix gmelinii) forests in Northeast China have been widely disturbed since the 1987 conflagration; however, its long-term effects on the forest carbon (C) cycling have not been explored. The objective of this study thus was to quantify the effects of fire severity and post-fire reforestation on C pools and the changes of these forests.
