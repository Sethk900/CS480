Towards a better assessment of the ecological status of coastal waters using satellite-derived chlorophyll-a concentrationsThe application of the new Water Framework Directive (WFD) of the European Union will require a dense and frequent monitoring of chlorophyll-a near the coast. Not counting the transitional water bodies located in the vicinity of estuaries, not less than seventy four coastal water bodies have to be monitored along the coast of the French Atlantic continental shelf and the English Channel. All the available data have to be gathered to implement a comprehensive monitoring scheme. To this purpose, we evaluate the capacity of ocean colour imagery to complete the conventional in situ data set collected in coastal networks. Satellite-derived chlorophyll-a concentration is obtained by the application of a coastal Look-Up-Table to water-leaving radiance of the Sea-viewing Wide Field Instrument Sensor (SeaWiFS) for the 1998â2004 period. Seven years of satellite-derived and in situ chlorophyll-a concentrations are compared at seven representative stations of different water bodies. These comparisons show that the satellite products are reliable in most of the situations studied and throughout the seasons. Then the satellite imagery is used to classify the coastal waters following the eutrophication risk criterion of the WFD. This classification is made according to the percentile-90 of chlorophyll-a calculated during the productive season, from March to October. Despite a lack of sensor coverage over a small fraction of the near shore waters, this work shows that the satellite monitoring can considerably ease the application of the WFD.
