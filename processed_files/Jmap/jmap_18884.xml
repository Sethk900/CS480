Plant biomass and production and CO2 exchange in an ombrotrophic bog1 Above-ground biomass was measured at bog hummock, bog hollow and poor-fen sites in Mer Bleue, a large, raised ombrotrophic bog near Ottawa, Ont., Canada. The average above-ground biomass was 587 g m(-2) in the bog, composed mainly of shrubs and Sphagnum capitula. In the poor fen, the average biomass was 317 g m(2), comprising mainly sedges and herbs and Sphagnum capitula. Vascular plant above-ground biomass was greater where the water table was lower, with a similar but weaker relationship for Sphagnum capitula and vascular leaf biomass. 2 Below-ground biomass averaged 2400 g m(2) at the bog hummock site, of which 300 g m(2) was fine roots (<2 mm diameter), compared with 1400 g m 2 in hollows (fine roots 450 g m(2)) and 1200 g m(2) at the poor-fen site. 3 Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) Of CO2 was measured in chambers and used to derive ecosystem respiration and photosynthesis. Under high light flux (PAR of 1500 &mu;mol m(2) s(1)), NEE ranged across sites from 0.08 to 0.22 mg m(2) s(1) (a positive value indicates ecosystem uptake) in the spring and summer, but fell to -0.01 to -0.13 mg m(-2) s(1) (i.e. a release of CO2) during a late-summer dry period. 4 There was a general agreement between a combination of literature estimates of photosynthetic capacity for shrubs and mosses and measured biomass and summertime CO2 uptake determined by the eddy covariance technique within a bog footprint (0.40 and 0.35-0.40 mg m(2) s(1), respectively). 5 Gross photosynthesis was estimated to be about 530 g m(2) year(1), total respiration 460 g m(-2) year(1), and export of DOC, DIC and CH4 10 g m(2) year(1), leaving an annual C sequestration rate of 60 g m(-2) year(1). Root production and decomposition are important parts of the C budget of the bog. Root C production was estimated to be 161-176 g m(2) year(1), resulting in fractional turnover rates of 0.2 and 1 year(1) for total and fine roots, respectively.
