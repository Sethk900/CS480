Gully erosion in Mangatu Forest, New Zealand, estimated from digital elevation modelsThe methodology and errors involved in determining the amount of sediment produced during two (19·5 and 33·2 year) periods by 11 (c. 0·01 − >0·20 km2) gullies within a 4 km2 area in the headwaters of the Waipaoa River basin, New Zealand, using sequential digital elevation models are described. Sediment production from all gullies within the study area was 0·99 ± 0·03 × 106 t a−1 (2480 ± 80 t ha−1 a−1) during the period from 1939 to 1958. It declined to 0·62 ± 0·02 × 106 t a−1 (1550 ± 50 t ha−1 a−1) during the period from 1958 to 1992, when many of the smaller gullies were stabilized by a programme of afforestation, which commenced in 1960. Both figures are very high by global standards. The two largest (the Tarndale and Mangatu) gully complexes together generated 73 and 95 per cent of the sediment in the specified time periods, but the latter amount is equivalent to only c. 5 per cent of the total annual sediment load of the Waipaoa River
