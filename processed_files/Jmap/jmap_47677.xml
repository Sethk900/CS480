An eyespot that â€œblinksâ€: an open and shut case of eye mimicry in Eumorpha caterpillars (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae)We describe the final instars of two tropical Sphingidae caterpillarsÂ â€“Â Eumorpha phorbas and Eumorpha labruscaeÂ â€“Â from Area de Conservacion Guanacaste, northwestern Costa Rica, whose anal horn has become a posterior eyespot structure capable of rapid palpitation. When approached or harassed, the caterpillars palpitate this eyespot and produce the effect of a blinking vertebrate eye. We propose that this â€œblinkingâ€ is an extension of eye mimicry or at least draws attention to the eyespot, functioning to startle or intimidate would-be predators. As snakes lack eyelids and do not blink, this suggests that the blinking eye represents a more generalized (or possibly mammalian) eye. Eyespot â€œblinkingâ€ is probably controlled by the same musculature used to wave the anal horn in earlier instars. The extent to which this eyespot is perceived as a blinking eye, and the degree of protection from the caterpillarsâ€™ suite of potential predators, remain to be discovered.
