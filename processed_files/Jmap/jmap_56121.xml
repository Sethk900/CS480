Characteristics of eroded sediments from soil under wheat and maize in the North Italian ApenninesIn this paper, different characteristics of runoff and eroded sediments were investigated as well as changes in textural composition of the original soil, on experimental plots. The objectives were to investigate the particle size distribution of the eroded sediments, as a function of soil, crop, and meteorological variables, and changes in texture due to water erosion over time. The study was performed on experimental plots in the Apennines mountain range, in northern Italy, where an automated system for measuring runoff water and sediment was installed. Runoff water, sediment yield and sediment mean diameters were analyzed as a function of land cover, rainfall kinetic energy and stream power. In particular, the study investigated: (a) the sediment particle size distribution using laser diffraction, (b) the effect of rainfall kinetic energy, stream power and crop coverage on runoff, sediment yield and sediment particle size distribution and (c) the changes in soil texture on the cultivated field plots, over a period of 15 years. The results of this study showed: (a) the particle size distribution of the eroded sediment was generally unimodal and the dominant fraction characterizing the eroded sediments was the one with a mean particle diameter ranging from 4.3 to 13.1 Î¼m, comprised in the silt range, (b) the mean particle diameter changed depending on the rainfall kinetic energy and the stream power, with a positive correlation between particle diameter and rainfall kinetic energy under bare soil, and (c) the effect of long-term erosion showed that the original soil textural composition experienced a statistically significant change over a period of 15 years, with a decrease in the silt fraction and a relative increase in the clay fraction, due to losses of silt in the eroded sediments.
