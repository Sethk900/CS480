Systematics of the Protohermes parcus species group (Megaloptera: Corydalidae), with notes on its phylogeny and biogeographyA species group, the Protohermes parcus group of the dobsonfly genus Protohermes, is proposed by the unique male genitalic structures. Five species belonging to the proposed species group from China and Nepal are described and illustrated, including three species new to science. A cladistic analysis is conducted to reconstruct the interspecific phylogeny within the proposed species group based on the morphological data. The biogeography of the proposed species group is also discussed.
