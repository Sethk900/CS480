Street-Crossing Behavior of People with DisabilitiesAbstractPhysical disability is as a multifaceted phenomenon, whose manifestations may be difficult to realize and properly address when designing or improving urban built environments. The mere application of technical requirements cannot account for designing accessible public spaces and infrastructures for pedestrian mobility. In this perspective, unsignalized crosswalks are emblematic. Design recommendations for them are prevalently focused on purely technical aspects, such as pedestrian walking speed and visibility problems. Apprehension and nervousness experienced by pedestrians when attempting to traverse the roadway is usually neglected, but this uneasinesses may weaken the autonomy and comfort of pedestrians with disabilities. Interaction with approaching drivers is a decisive factor. It is known that unimpaired pedestrians attempt hazardous crossings if they realize that drivers do not observe their right-of-way. The question arises of investigating street-crossing behavior of people with different impairments and their interaction with drivers. Field surveys was carried out wherein people with different disabilities were requested to traverse the roadway using unsignalized crosswalks. Survival analyses were then applied on gathered waiting times at the curbside to ascertain the way in which disability status and other characteristics influence the interaction between drivers and pedestrians. However, given the complexity of the examined phenomenon, the analytical approach must act in synergy with qualitative observations and peopleâ€™s concerns for acquiring the most possible complete framework. Street crossing was particularly arduous for people in wheelchairs, while individuals with hearing impairments revealed unexpected versatility against a hostile urban environment.
