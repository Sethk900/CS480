Dung-insect community composition in and zones of south-eastern SpainDung-insect community composition was studied at three sites for 1 year, and for a further 8 months at one site, in an and region of Spain. The insect community was dominated by ants, dung flies and beetles. Ants were abundant and flies relatively scarce at all three sites, whereas beetle diversity and abundance differed among sites and between years. Community composition varied along the year in species richness, abundance and biomass. Although dung-insect communities of and Spain share some traits with dung-insect assemblages in other deserts, diversity and trophic structure of these communities are highly variable, a common but underappreciated feature of communities in and regions.
