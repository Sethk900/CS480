Characterization of the novel Listeria monocytogenes PCR serogrouping profile IVb-v1.The World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Listeria (WHOCCL) has developed in 2004 a multiplex PCR assay that separates the 4 major Listeria monocytogenes serovars (1/2a, 1/2b, 1/2c, and 4b) into distinct PCR serogroups. A new PCR profile has been recently identified, constituted of amplified DNA fragments of prs, ORF2819, ORF2110 and lmo0737. Here we characterize 22 L. monocytogenes isolates of the WHOCCL collection with this PCR IVb variant 1 (IVb-v1) profile. The 22 isolates belong to the clinically predominant serovar 4b, exhibit 6 distinct pulsed-field gel electrophoresis ApaI/AscI combined profiles, and belong to 2 unrelated multilocus sequence types, indicating that the novel profile does not correspond to a recent clonal emergence. We have updated the WHOCCL serogroup-related PCR typing scheme to include this new profile.
