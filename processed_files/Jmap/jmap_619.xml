Pre- and post-dispersal seed loss and soil seed dynamics of the dominant Bulnesia retama (Zygophyllaceae) shrub in a sandy Monte desert of western Argentina.In deserts and semi-deserts dominant plants seldom rely on a persistent seed bank to ensure their recruitment from sexual reproduction, which is generally based on the seeds produced in the last reproductive event. We studied pre- and post-dispersal seed loss of Bulnesia retama, a dominant shrub of the sandy Monte deserts (western Argentina). We hypothesised that pre- and post-dispersal seed depletion in B. retama regulate soil seed density and in turn decrease soil seed reserves. We also hypothesised that spatial patches induced by standing vegetation and other microsites additionally affect post-dispersal seed loss and soil seed density.
