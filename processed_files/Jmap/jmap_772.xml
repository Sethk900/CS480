Factors influencing seed germination of Cyperus capitatus, inhabiting the moving sand dunes in southern Europe.Cyperus capitatus Vandelli (Cyperaceae) is distributed in coastal sandy habitats and mobile dunes of south Europe. Its seed germination ecology is not known, despite its potential to be used in re-vegetation projects. Laboratory experiments were conduced to assess the effects of salinity, light regime, cold stratification and burial on seed germination of this species. Overall, increasing salinity delayed germination, increased seed dormancy and mean time to germination (MTG), and reduced final germination percentage, inhibiting it completely above 1% of salinity; although it did not affect seed viability. C. capitatus seeds exhibited their greatest germination at levels between 0 and 1% in non-stratified seeds, and between 0 and 0.5% for stratified seeds. Thus, the effect of salt was greater for stratified seeds at 5 Â°C. Germination in light/darkness conditions was similar to that in full darkness. Finally, burial in sand of C. capitatus seeds appeared to have a significant effect on cumulative percentage of germination. Seeds buried at depths greater than 2 and 3 cm showed a lower germination success than those on sand surface or buried at shallower depths. Burial also affected the beginning and speed of seed germination.
