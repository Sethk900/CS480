Thermal characterization of a new green ceramic material by heating microscopy, thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysisA new ceramic material ‘‘Vikaflex’’ was developed from industrially pyrolized shale solid residue. Thermal properties of this material were studied by thermal microscopy, TG, DTG and DTA analyses at temperature from 400 to 1,400 C. The thermal expansion coefficient was estimated from the heating microscope images for the solid phase before losing its shape using an improvement of a previous method. The specific heat capacity and mass change between 600 and 1,100 C were detected. This porous solid material shows high thermal stability up to 1,050 C.
