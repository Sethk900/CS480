Chinese species of egg-parasitoids of the genera Oxyscelio Kieffer, Heptascelio Kieffer and Platyscelio Kieffer (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae s.l., Scelioninae)Abstract To date, the known Chinese fauna of egg-parasitoids of the genus Oxyscelio Kieffer encompasses two species from the mainland – Oxyscelio doumao Burks and Oxyscelio nubbin Burks. Here we record eighteen species of Oxyscelio from collections in mainland China: Oxyscelio arvi Burks, Oxyscelio ceylonensis (Dodd), Oxyscelio convergens Burks, Oxyscelio cordis Burks, Oxyscelio crebritas Burks, Oxyscelio cuculli Burks, Oxyscelio dermatoglyphes Burks, Oxyscelio doumao Burks, Oxyscelio florus Kononova, Oxyscelio granorum Burks, Oxyscelio intermedietas Burks, Oxyscelio jugi Burks, Oxyscelio kramatos Burks, Oxyscelio longiventris Burks, Oxyscelio naraws Kozlov & Lê, Oxyscelio perpensus Kononova, Oxyscelio planocarinae Burks, and Oxyscelio striarum Burks. Oxyscelio is primarily found in the tropics, and most of these species are shared with Taiwan and southeast Asia. Three species previously known only from Japan, Oxyscelio arvi, Oxyscelio florus, Oxyscelio perpensus, are shared. The Chinese species are recorded from Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Hebei, Hunan, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Yunnan and Zhejiang as well as additional material from Taiwan. Heptascelio hamatus Masner & Johnson and Platyscelio pulchricornis Kieffer are both recorded from Hainan and Guangdong, as well as records of Platyscelio pulchricornis from Sarawak and Thailand.
