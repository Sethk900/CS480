Male Sage Grouse Responses to Sagebrush TreatmentMale sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) populations on six central Montana strutting grounds were studied in relation to sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) treatment. Populations on 3 strutting grounds within 0.5 km of treated areas increased 28 percent, whereas 2 grounds farther than 4 km from treated areas increased 323 percent. Over a 2-year period, a 31 percent loss of suitable habi- tat within 0.5 km of another strutting ground resulted in a 63 percent decrease in numbers of strutting males
