Small giants from Madagascan caves: autapomorphic giantism in the new cave-dwelling planthopper Tsingya clarkei gen. nov., sp. nov. (Hemiptera: Fulgoroidea: Meenoplidae)A new giant cave-dwelling species of planthopper of the family Meenoplidae (Fulgoromorpha) is described from the Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park in western Madagascar, with information on its distribution and ecology. As the new species could not be placed in any of the previously described genera, a new genus is established. This is the first record of a cavernicolous meenoplid from the Afrotropical Region, and the second cave-dwelling Fulgoromorphan species from Madagascar. It is also the second example of island gigantism in the Fulgoromorpha from Madagascar.
