Basilichthys microlepidotus (Jenyns, 1842) and Basilichthys australis Eigenmann, 1927 (Pisces: Teleostei, Atherinidae): Comments on their morphological differentiationBasilichthys microlepidotus and B. australis are endemic and allopatric fishes in Chile. It is possible to separate both species by morphometric analysis of populations selected through their range of distribution. The number of mediolateral scales shows a consistent pattern of variation to be considered for taxonomic resolution. Species discrimination is not possible by univariate analysis of body ratios, due to strong overlap. However, by multivariate analysis the taxonomic distinction can be achieved. The features used for species differentiation are size, length of predorsal 1st fin, maximum depth, prepelvic distance, and preanal and head length. Osteological comparisons and counts of scales proved to be inconclusive.
