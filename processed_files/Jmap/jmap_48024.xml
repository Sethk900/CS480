A Simple Test for Change in Community StructureThe effect of disturbance on a biological community is commonly measured by a change in an index of community structure. When such an index is calculated from a sample from the community, it is important to assess the statistical significance of an observed change. A simple randomization test is described for testing for change in community structure. The test can be used in conjunction with any measure of community structure based on observed species abundances such as diversity indices. An example is given.
