Breeding Season Movements and Habitat Selection of Male Sage GrouseMovements and habitat requirements of sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) cocks were studied in central Montana during the breeding seasons of 1968 and 1972. Fifteen sage grouse cocks were captured and radio-equipped. Movements of up to 0.8 mile (1.3 km) from the strutting grounds were common, with 82 percent of the locations falling beyond 0.2 mile (0.3 km). Sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) with a canopy coverage of 20-50 percent occurred at 80 percent of the 110 locations mea- sured. Average sagebrush canopy coverage at these sites was 32 percent. Strutting grounds are key ac- tivity areas within wintering-nesting complexes which can be readily identified and delimited, and should be given complete protection from sagebrush removal projects. Results of this and previous studies in this area indicate that this protection should extend to a radius of no less than 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from strutting grounds
