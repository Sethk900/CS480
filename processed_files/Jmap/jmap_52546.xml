Cranchiids of the South Atlantic Mid-Oceanic Ridge: results from the first southern MAR-ECO expeditionCranchiids were the most diverse squid family collected during the first southern MAR-ECO expedition in late 2009, with nine taxa identified to species. A total of 45 young specimens were collected (mantle length 7.4–59.2 mm), allowing a survey of early ontogenetic tentacular morphology in cranchiids using scanning electron micrographs. Paralarval tentacular sucker morphology appeared similar among species within the same subfamily: in the Cranchiinae, the paralarval suckers possess relatively large, narrowly polygonal or ovoid-faced pegs in the innermost ring around the aperture, and the infundibular ring lacks the dentition observed in most taoniin genera. Hook development in Galiteuthis armata appears to vary widely among small individuals. Tissue samples were also collected from five genera (Cranchia, Galiteuthis, Helicocranchia, Leachia and Teuthowenia); phylogenetic trees (maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods) built using these cytochrome oxidase subunit I sequences and others available from GenBank show some support for the subfamilies Cranchiinae and Taoniinae, and that within the latter, the hooked taxa group together. It is hoped that reporting this opportunistic systematic and genetic information may be of eventual assistance in helping to resolve this most problematic of squid families.
