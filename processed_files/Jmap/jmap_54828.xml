Integrated Toposequence Analyses to combine local and scientific knowledge systemsIntegrated Toposequence Analysis (ITA) was used to integrate scientific and local knowledge on land resources and land use systems and to identify factors determining land use and land resource management. The application of ITA at different toposequence types resulted in a nested, geo-referenced information system relevant to different decision-making levels, and demonstrated the variation in soils, land cover/use and cropping systems between landform complexes (macro), unit landforms (meso) and facets (micro) at the Nsukka Agricultural Zone (southeastern Nigeria). The local soil classification was coupled to the World Reference Base for Soil Resources using the results of three toposequences and eight soil profile pits. Despite the overall low soil fertility, distinct differences in cropping systems and cultivation techniques were practised. Local land use and management decisions were guided by the local soil classification and depended on the position in the landscape, the soil texture, occurrence of ironstone and soil colour to tillage depth. The local knowledge provided insights in present management strategies, whereas the scientific information demonstrated the constraints on present land use systems.
