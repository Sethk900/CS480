Mineralogy of two red soil (Alfisol) profiles of mysore state, IndiaQuantitative mineralogical composition of the clay fractions of two red soil (Alfisol) profiles developed on gneissic rocks in Mysore, India, is discussed in relation to the genesis of these soils. Data on the mineralogy of their silt and sand fractions are also presented. Both the silt and clay fractions are kaolinitic and contain considerable amorphous material. A possible weathering sequence of transformation of the minerals, with probable mechanisms involved, is suggested.
