Neoformation of pedogenic carbonates by irrigation and fertilization and their contribution to carbon sequestration in soilThe impact of land use change and farming management on soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil inorganic carbon (SIC), particularly pedogenic carbonates (PC), was assessed in a semi-humid region of China. The SOC and SIC content and stocks were measured, and δ13C values were used to calculate the percentage of PC and lithogenic carbonates (LC) in the total SIC. Over the 39-year period, organic fertilizers at high and low rates (OFH and OFL), mineral fertilizers (MF), and a control site without fertilizers (CK) showed an increase of PC compared to a natural fallow plot (F). The main pathway of SIC accumulation was the neoformation of pedo-atmogenic carbonates contributing to C sequestration of at least 0.38, 0.27, 0.23, and 0.12 Mg C ha− 1 yr− 1 for the OFH, OFL, MF, and CK treatments, respectively. The LC stock remained similar in all treatments except for the CK, where LC was significantly lower than all of the other treatments which suggested dissolution. An increase in OC stocks in response to organic fertilization was not limited to the surface soil, but it continued down the soil profile to a depth of 160 cm. The maximum potential for neoformation of PC depends on Ca2 + and Mg2 + availability; in this study these cations were provided by irrigation water. However, organic and mineral fertilizers modify this potential. Without organic and mineral fertilization, the PC formed at the expense of dissolution and re-precipitation of LC, even when substantial quantities of Ca2 + and Mg2 + were present in the soil. Our experimental results indicate that the neoformation of PC should be considered during estimation of soil carbon stocks and sequestration for the development of optimal fertilization, irrigation and land use practices.13
