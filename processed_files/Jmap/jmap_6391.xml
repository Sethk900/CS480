An automated colorimetric method for the determination of dicyandiamide in 1.0 M KCI soil extractsThe nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (cyanoguanidine, didin or DCD) reacts with 1-naphthol and diacetyl to form a red complex which measures spectrophotometrically at 540 nm. An automated analytical procedure was developed to determine DCD in soils extracted with 1.0 M KCI. The method was optimized and evaluated between 0.2 and 30 mg dm−3 DCD-N. The calibration curve showed a high degree of linearity between 2 and 30 mg dm−3 DCD-N. Accurate and reliable readings were achieved at a sampling frequency of 30 samples h−1. The transmittance between samples was less than 2.00%. A number of ions were tested for possible interference. Interference levels were reduced With the introduction of ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) and mannitol.
