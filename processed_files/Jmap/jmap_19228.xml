Separation of soil respiration into CO2 emission sources using C-13 natural abundance in a deciduous broad-leaved forest in JapanIn determining the soil and ecosystem carbon balance, it is necessary to distinguish between autotrophic respiration and heterotrophic respiration. We attempted to measure the contribution of CO2 emissions from plant roots (R-RHI), from soil organic matter (R-SOM), and from litter (R-L) to CO2 emissions from the forest floor (soil respiration; R-S) in a deciduous forest of oak (Quercus serrata Thunb.) and hornbeams (Carpinus laxiflora Sieb. et Zucc. Bl., Carpinus tschonoskii Maxim. and Carpinus japonica Bl.) on Andosols in Japan, using a C-13 natural abundance technique. The C-13 natural abundances of roots (delta(RHI)), litter (delta(L)) and SOM (delta(SOM)) in the surface soil were -28.9, -30.1 and -24.3 parts per thousand, respectively. This means that the differences between delta(SOM) and delta(RHI) are large enough to calculate the contributions of R-RHI, R-SOM and R-L to R-S based on the mass balance of the CO2 isotope ratios. R-RHI and R-SOM had close relationships with soil temperature, and R-L was influenced by soil temperature and moisture. In summer, under high soil temperatures, R-RHI and R-SOM were the predominant sources of R-S and the proportion of R-RHI to R-SOM to R-L was 51:44:5. In winter, R-L was predominant and the proportion of R-RHI to R-SOM to R-L was 20:11:69. The estimated annual emissions of R-RHI, R-SOM and R-L were 1.45, 2.10 and 1.30 Mg C ha(-1), respectively; thus, the proportion of R-RHI to R-SOM to R-L was 30:43:27 on a whole-year basis.
