Optimal Allocation of Resources for the Maximization of Net Agricultural ReturnAbstractGood quality soil and water resources are often limited in arid and semi-arid regions; however, poor quality groundwater can be used conjunctively with good quality canal water to fulfill crop water demand in these areas. In the present study, a linear programming model was developed for the optimal land and water resources allocation to maximize net annual returns from a command area located in Jhajjar district of Haryana, India. The water production functions were developed and incorporated in the model to estimate the crop yield under different qualities of irrigation water. A groundwater balance constraint was imposed on the model, which mitigated the waterlogging problems while making optimal use of land and water resources. The model results show a reduction in rice and mustard areas against an increase in cotton, sugarcane, and wheat under optimal conditions. Under the optimal land and water allocation the groundwater use increases, which in turn mitigates the waterlogging and salinity problems of the command area. The net annual return from the command area increased by more than 20% under optimal allocations. The sensitivity analysis of the model parameters show that better price of crops is the most sensitive parameter followed by the crop area and cost of cultivation. State agencies and farmers involved in the actual agricultural production process are advised to practice conjunctive use of canal water and groundwater to maximize their farm income. This strategy could also mitigate further rise in the water table in the command area without installing expensive drainage systems, which is also not feasible because the groundwater quality is poor and the drainage water may pose a serious disposal problem.
