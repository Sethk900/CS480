History of greater sage-grouse in the Dakotas: Distribution and population trendsThe greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) has declined throughout its range and its status is of major concern to federal, state, and provincial wildlife agencies. We collected information on current and historical greater sage-grouse distribution and lek activity in western North and South Dakota. A steady decline in lek attendance by males occurred over the entire recorded period in North Dakota (1951-2002) and South Dakota (1972-2002). There was no apparent change in numbers of known active leks due to discovery of new leks, but there was an abandonment of regions once occupied by active leks.
