A PATTERNLESS MORPH OF THE MARBLED WHIPTAIL (ASPIDOSCELIS MARMORATA; SQUAMATA: TEIIDAE) IN NEW MEXICOThe marbled whiptail (Aspidoscelis marmorata) is a common lizard within the Chihuahuan Desert of the United States Mexico borderlands. We report a patternless female from the Mescalero-Monahans Shinnery Sands Ecosystem in southeastern New Mexico. One previous record of this pattern has been noted in the literature and this unique morphology has not been investigated thoroughly.
