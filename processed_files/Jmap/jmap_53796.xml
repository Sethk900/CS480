Soil heterogeneity and profile development in a stratified gravel deposit in IrelandThe spatial variation in a soil section developed in a stratified, coarse-textured deltaic deposit is documented. Analytical and morphological data are presented for 8 A horizon, 19 B horizon and 6 C horizon samples taken from a 5-m section. The occurrence of a lithologic discontinuity at the A-B boundary as well as many stratigraphical discontinuities occurring diagonally across the B and C horizons is demonstrated. As a consequence a number of different soil profiles, which would place the soils in diverse soil orders or great groups in most classification systems, were found to exist side by side in the section studied. The problem of placing lateral boundaries to sampling sites in such materials is highlighted and the exclusive use of fine earth (<2 mm material) when assessing pedogenic trends and processes in coarse-textured materials is questioned.
