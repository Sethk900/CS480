Dynamics of phosphorus phytoavailability in soil amended with stabilized sewage sludge materialsReducing the environmental risk of soluble P loss from sludge-amended soils is essential for increasing soils capacity to utilize sewage sludge beneficially. Fresh dewatered anaerobically digested sewage sludge (FSS), stabilized with ferrous sulphate (FeSul–SS), calcium oxide (CaO–SS) and aluminum sulphate (alum–SS), each at three chemical-to-FSS ratios, or by composting (BSC), was applied to alluvial soil at rates of 150 and 300 mg P kg− 1 soil. Changes in P phytoavailability in comparison to KH2PO4-amended soil were probed during 100 days of incubation by a P-bioassay and were compared to the concentration of water-soluble P (WSP) and Olsen-P. P phytoavailability was notably linked to the incubation duration and the stabilization process. In general, P phytoavailability at equal P-addition rates was KH2PO4 > > alum–SS > BSC ≥ FSS > CaO–SS > > FeSul–SS; and it was positively related to the added P rates, although with quite different patterns among the various sludge products. The concentration of inorganic WSP (WSPi) extracted from the soil increased following the application of FSS or BSC, and additional P mineralization further increased its concentration during incubation. In contrast, in most cases the chemically stabilized sludges, especially the FeSul–SS, showed considerably reduced inorganic WSP concentrations relative to the untreated soil. The total WSP, Olsen-P and organic WSP (WSPo) positively correlated to P phytoavailability, indicating that WSPo plays a role in plant P utilization in these soils. It is concluded that all the chemically stabilized sewage sludge studied effectively controlled WSPi in soil while still supplying P to support plant growth.
