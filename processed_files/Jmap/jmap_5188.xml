A new family of the Hoplonemertea: Cinclidonemertes mooreae fam., gen. et sp. nov. (Nemertea: Hoplonemertea)Recent morphological, cladistic and molecular phylogenetic studies suggest a strong relationship between Cratenemertidae and Reptantia. In contrast to other hoplonemerteans, these groups have complex cerebral organs located behind the pre-cerebral septum possessing both sensory and â€œsac-typeâ€ epithelial components in the canal structure and a robust single-layered rhynchocoel wall composed of interwoven circular and longitudinal muscle fibres. Four specimens collected by the US Antarctic Program, listed in an earlier cladistic study as â€œAntarctic Câ€, distinct from other Hoplonemertea and related to Cratenemertidae and Reptantia, are described herein as Cinclidonemertes mooreae fam., gen. et sp. nov. They have complex cerebral organs, with the same two types of canal epithelium, lying against the sides of the brain and extending below and behind it ventrally, a lattice-like rhynchocoel wall with partial interweaving, and four large shallow cup-shaped eyes with little pigment as opposed to the numerous heavily pigmented deep-cup ocelli of Cratenemertidae and Reptantia.
