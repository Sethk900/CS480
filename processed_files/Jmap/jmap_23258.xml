Revision of three camaenid and one bradybaenid species (Gastropoda, Stylommatophora) from China based on morphological and molecular data, with description of a new bradybaenid subspecies from Inner Mongolia, ChinaAbstract We have revised the taxonomy of three camaenid and one bradybaenid species from China and described one new subspecies of the genus Bradybaena (Family Bradybaenidae) from Inner Mongolia, China. The genitalia of three Satsuma (Family Camaenidae) species S. mellea stenozona (Moellendorff, 1884), S. meridionalis (Moellendorff, 1884), comb. n. and S. uncopila (Heude, 1882), comb. n. assigned to the genus Bradybaena previously,lack a dart sac and mucous glands. Moreover, the molecular phylogeny has revealed close relationships between the three species and the genus Satsuma. Two species, S. stenozona (Moellendorff, 1884) from Fuzhou and Ganesella citrina Zilch, 1940 from Wuyi Mountain, are considered as synonymous and should be a subspecies of S. mellea mellea (Pfeiffer, 1866) because of the morphological and molecular similarities. Meanwhile, the other two are placed in the genus Satsuma: S. meridionalis (Moellendorff, 1884), comb. n. and S. uncopila (Heude, 1882), comb. n. G. virgo Pilsbry, 1927 differs from species of the genera Ganesella and Satsuma not only in its shell, but also in anatomical characters, such as having a dart sac and mucous gland, and lacking a flagellum. Additionally, phylogenetic analyses highly support the sister relationship with other Bradybaena species. Thus, placement of G. virgo Pilsbry, 1927 in the genus Bradybaena issuggested.
