Spinnen aus Brasilien, II. Vier neue Ochyroceratidae aus Amazonas nebst Bemerkungen Ã¼ber andere Amerikanische Arten (Arachnida: Araneae)Summary Spiders from Brazil. II. Four new Ochyroceratidae from Amazonas and remarks on other American species (Arachnida: Araneae). The following new species, all from Brazil, Amazonas, surroundings of Manaus, are described: Ochyrocera hamadryas n.sp. (â™‚ , â™€ unknown; possibly near to O. vesiculifera Simon, 1892 from Venezuela), Speocera amazonica n.sp. (â™‚â™€ ), S. molesta n.sp. (male;,â™€ unknown), S. irritans n.sp. (â™‚, â™€ unknown); as no other Speocera had been described from South America, their affinities are uncertain; S. amazonica and S. irrilans are somewhat related. The position of the genus Calheirosia Mello Leitao, 1917, described in the Leptonetidae, is discussed; from the description it seems to belong to the Scytodidae; it is possibly a synonym of Loxosceles. The genus Physoglenes Simon, 1904, described also in the Leptonetidae and since long placed in the Pholcidae, does not belong to any described family of the Haplogynae; it belongs either to some family of the ,,Semientelegynaeâ€; (Araneoidea), or to a still undescribed family. A few species attributed to the genus Oonopinus Simon, 1892 (Oonopidae) belong possibly to the Ochyroceratidae, so O. centralis Gertsch, 1941, O. argentinus Biraben, 1955, O. modestus Chickering, 1951, O. pallidulus Chickering, 1951 and O. minutissimus Petrunkevitch, 1929 (the â™‚ attributed to this last species, by Bryant. 1940, belongs to Theotima).
