Phylogenetic analysis of social behavior evolution in [Zetoborinae + Blaberinae + Gyninae + Diplopterinae] cockroaches: an update with the study of endemic radiations from the Atlantic forestWe updated the phylogenetic analysis of the evolution of habitat choice and social habits in the cockroach group of [Zetoborinae + Blaberinae + Gyninae + Diplopterinae] (Dictyoptera: Blaberidae) elaborated by Grandcolas (1998b). The original phylogenetic matrix was updated with new data obtained in the Brazilian Atlantic forest for the genera Parasphaeria and Zetobora (Zetoborinae), Monastria, Petasodes (Blaberinae) and Pycnoscelus (Pycnoscelinae) (one outgroup). These new data did not change the tree topology but showed that the fauna of the Atlantic forest has a complex evolutionary origin with several different radiations, one of which is local, and behavioral convergences or originalities.
