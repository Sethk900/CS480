Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) time-lapse imagery of tsunami waves from the 26 December 2004 SumatraâAndaman earthquakeOn 26 December 2004, a few hours after a massive earthquake occurred off the western coast of Sumatra in the Indian Ocean generating a major tsunami, the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument on NASA's Terra satellite captured unique, time-lapse evidence of extremely large waves occurring along the eastern coast of India. The MISR imagery provides information on the location and characteristics of tsunami waves in near-shore waters, along with estimates of the wave speed.
