Large enchytraeid (Annelida: Oligochaeta) worms and associated fauna from unglaciated soils of the northern Yukon, CanadaDensities of up to 100 m−2 of large (10 to 60 mm long) cream-coloured enchytraeid worms (Henlea cf. udei [Eisen, 1904]) (Annelida: Oligochaeta) were observed in the moder humus forms of some subarctic soils from the unglaciated portion of the northern Yukon. These cold, moist soils were classified as either Brunisolic or Cryosolic depending on their depth from the surface to the underlying permafrost table and they were all characterized by thick surface accumulations of well humified organic matter. Enchytraeidae at 113.7 mg dry wt m−2 constituted more than half the total faunal biomass of 203.4 mg dry wt m−2. Cryptostigmata (Arthropoda: Acarina) dominated both numbers and biomass of the arthropod fauna. Protozoa at 6.5·108 m−2 and Nematoda at 4.3·105 m−2 were the most abundant taxa, but nematode biomass was less than half that of Cryptostigmata in these soils. An unusual feature of the arthropod fauna was the abundance of Protura, a hexapod taxon not previously reported in the northern Yukon. The enchytraeid worms have an unusually thick cuticle and are, as other earthworms, geophagous. It is suggested that these large enchytraeids evolved in soils not glaciated during the Pleistocene under the largely periglacial environment that has existed since the Tertiary.
