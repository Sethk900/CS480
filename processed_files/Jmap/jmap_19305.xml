Observation and modeling of NPP for Pinus elliottii plantation in subtropical ChinaBased on the stem analysis of 59 individuals of Pinus elliottii in combination with tree biomass models, we calculated annual biomass increment of forest plots at Qianyanzhou Ecological Station, Chinese Academy of Sciences in subtropical China. In addition, canopy layer and community NPP were calculated based on 12 years' litter fall data. NPP of the 21-year-old forest was estimated by using the BIOME BGC model; and both measured NPP and estimated NPP were compared with flux data. Community biomass was 10574 g . m(-2); its distribution patterns in tree layer, shrub layer, herbaceous layer, tree root, herbaceous and shrub roots and fine roots were 7542, 480, 239, 1810, 230, 274 and 239 g . m(-2), respectively. From 1999 to 2004, the average annual growth rate and litter fall were 741 g . m(-2) . a(-1) (381.31 gC . m(-2) . a(-1)) and 849 g . m(-2) . a(-1)(463 gC . m(-2) . a(-1)), respectively. There was a significant correlation between annual litter fall and annual biomass increment; and the litter fall was 1.19 times the biomass increment of living trees. From 1985 to 2005, average NPP and GPP values based on BGC modeling were 630.88 (343.31-906.42 gC . m(-2) . a(-1)) and 1 800 gC . m(-2) . a(-1)(1351.62-2318.26 gC . m(-2) . a(-1)). Regression analysis showed a linear relationship (R-2 =0.48) between the measured and simulated tree layer NPP values. NPP accounted for 30.2% (25.6%-32.9%) of GPP, while NEP accounted for 57.5% (48.1%-66.5%) of tree-layer NPP and 41.74% (37%-52%) of stand NPP. Soil respiration accounted for 77.0% of measured tree NPP and 55.9% of the measured stand NPP. NEE based on eddy covariance method was 12.97% higher than the observed NEP.
