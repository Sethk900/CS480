Nutrient Loads to Cayuga Lake, New York: Watershed Modeling on a BudgetAbstractNutrient loads were estimated for the 34 watersheds draining into Cayuga Lake, New York, through use of a watershed model. Financial and human resources were very limited for the project, but significant cost savings were achieved through project decisions. Chief among these were selection of a watershed model that did not require calibration and use of historic water quality monitoring data for model testing. Savings were also obtained by extrapolating soil properties from related information (nutrient contents from organic matter), substituting literature concentrations for missing point source data, extrapolating septic system performance from one area to another, and use of synthetic weather data generated from a model. None of the decisions was remarkable in itself, but together, they permitted a watershed study and its associated modeling to be accomplished with modest resources.
