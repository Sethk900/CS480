Accumulation of phenolic compounds in birch leaves is changed by elevated carbon dioxide and ozone.Atmospheric change may affect plant phenolic compounds, which play an important part in plant survival. Therefore, we studied the impacts of CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> on the accumulation of 27 phenolic compounds in the short-shoot leaves of two European silver birch (<em>Betula pendula</em> Roth) clones (clones 4 and 80). Seven-year-old soil-grown trees were exposed in open-top chambers over three growing seasons to ambient and twice ambient CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations singly and in combination in central Finland.
