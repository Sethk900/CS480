Mechanism and Pathway of Tetrachloroethylene Dechlorination by Zero-Valent Iron with Cu or Cu/CAbstractTetrachloroethylene (PCE) is a common contaminant in the groundwater. The mechanism and pathway of PCE dechlorination by zero-valent iron (Fe) in the presence of Cu (Fe–Cu), alone or with powdered activated carbon (Fe–Cu/C) were studied. The experimental results have demonstrated that (1) Fe–Cu/C produced higher PCE removal efficiency than adsorption by C or dechlorination by Fe or Fe–Cu due to adsorption and the synergetic effects of Fe–Cu and Fe–C microelectrodes, (2) the batch PCE dechlorination was most rapid at the neutral pH, (3) Fe–Cu/C dechlorination resulted in smaller and more porous Fe particles, and (4) PCE was sequentially dechlorinated to form trichloroethylene, dichloroethylenes (cis, 1,1, and trans isomers), methylene chloride, and vinyl chloride. Fe–Cu/C dechlorination is an attractive technology for the remediation of PCE-contaminated groundwater.
