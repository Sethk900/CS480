Redescription and Taxonomic Considerations of Belostoma gestroi Montandon, 1900 (Heteroptera: Belostomatidae)Belostoma gestroi Montandon, 1900, is redescribed and its distribution is mapped. This species is newly recorded from the Brazilian states of Amazonas and Mato Grosso do Sul, and the Argentinan province of Formosa. Specimens from Argentina and Paraguay are designated lectotype and paralectotype, respectively. Notes on intraspecific variations are given. The previously unknown prosternal keel and phallic variations are described and figured for the first time. The vertex with a longitudinal median carina is a condition not found in the other species of the B. dilatatum group. However, this carina is often weakly in B. gestroi.
