Microstructure and surface mechanical property of AZ31 Mg/SiCp surface composite fabricated by Direct Friction Stir ProcessingIn this paper, Direct Friction Stir Processing (DFSP) to produce surface composite was proposed. A hollow and pinless DFSP tool was designed to fabricate the surface composite on the AZ31 plate of rolling state. The reinforcement particles flowed out through the through-hole of DFSP tool and entered the enclosed space between shoulder and base metal. They were then pressed into the workpiece as the rotating tool advanced along it just like a ‘planter’. Microstructure observed by optical microscope and scanning electron microscope showed that the reinforcement particles were homogeneous and dispersed in the stir zone. The thickness of the composite layer reached 150 lm. The grain size decreased from 16.57 lm to 1.24 lm in the composite layer. The micro-hardness increased from 57.77 Hv to 115.51 Hv. The plow width of the AZ31 with SiC decreased from 620 lm to 410 lm for the wear test.
