A new day dawning: Hemerocallis (daylily) as a future model organismIn this point of view paper, we argue that the monocot genus Hemerocallis (daylily) satisfies multiple criteria for selection as a ‘new model organism’ for intensive biological investigation. We discuss its important and interesting attributes at the biological, horticultural and medicinal levels. These include an intriguing self-incompatibility system, a sophisticated mechanism for flower bud opening and programmed floral death, and a long history of use by man as a vegetable, ornamental and medicinal plant. We examine the potential for modern technical developments to transform Hemerocallis into a valuable model plant. Genetic model organisms have revolutionized science, and today, with the rapid advances in technology, there is significant potential to launch many more plant species towards model status. However, these new model organisms will have to be carefully selected. Here, we argue that Hemerocallis (daylily) satisfies multiple criteria for selection and deserves serious consideration as a subject of intensive biological investigation. Several attributes of the genus are of great biological interest. These include the strict control of flower opening and, within a short period, the precisely regulated floral death by a programmed cell death system. The self-incompatibility system in Hemerocallis is also noteworthy and deserves more attention. Importantly, the genus is widely cultivated for food, medicinal value and ornamental interest. Hemerocallis has considerable potential as a ‘nutraceutical’ food plant and the source of new compounds with biomedical activity. The genus has also been embraced by ornamental plant breeders and the extraordinary morphological diversity of hybrid cultivars, produced within a relatively short time by amateur enthusiasts, is an exceptional resource for botanical and genetic studies. We explore these points in detail, explaining the reasons why this genus has considerable value—both academic and socio-economic—and deserves new resources devoted to its exploration as a model. Its impact as a future model will be enhanced by its amenability to cultivation in laboratory and field conditions. In addition, established methods for various tissue and cell culture systems as well as transformation will permit maximum exploitation of this genus by science.
