LizLand: A geomorphic approach to lizard habitat modeling in the Mojave DesertThe macro-habitat preferences of three conspicuous and widely distributed species of lizards (Aspidoscelis tigris, Callisaurus draconoides, and Uta stansburiana) were examined across four geomorphic landforms (sandy wash, rocky wash, alluvial plain, and alluvial deposit) in the southern Mojave Desert, California. All three species were non-randomly distributed across the four geomorphic landforms. The goal of this study was to develop less ecologically generalized habitat models (LizLand) than the vegetation-based wildlife-habitat relationship models in the California Gap Analysis Program (CA-GAP). Conceptually, LizLand is a geomorphological approach to habitat modeling in and environments. Specifically, LizLand is a series of spatially explicit habitat models that define and predict habitat for A. tigris, C. draconoides, and U. stansburiana in Joshua Tree National Park and the Marine Air Ground Task Force Training Command, Marine Corp Air Ground Combat Center. LizLand models resulted in higher resolution habitat models with minimal reduction in model accuracy. These models more accurately captured the complexity of the Mojave Desert ecosystem and offered greater ecological resolution in identifying habitat in contrast to the CA-GAP models.
