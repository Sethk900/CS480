Seedling mortality causes recruitment limitation of Boswellia papyrifera in northern Ethiopia.The Frankincense tree Boswellia papyrifera is an important resource in the semiarid lower highlands of eastern Africa but its populations are declining due to human pressure and environmental degradation. To assess the perspectives of (assisted) natural regeneration for Boswellia woodland restoration, we examined Boswellia stand structure and seedling densities in a grazed woodland and in a livestock grazing exclosure. We also tested topsoil scarification as a means to increase seedling survival.
