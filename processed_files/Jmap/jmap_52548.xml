Tanaidacea (Crustacea: Peracarida) of the northeast Atlantic: Chauliopleona Dojiri and Sieg, 1997 and Saurotipleona n. gen. from the ‘Atlantic Margin’Two akanthophoreid taxa, Chauliopleona and the new genus Saurotipleona, are modest contributors to tanaidacean diversity in the benthos of seas from Iceland to the British Isles along the ‘Atlantic Margin’. Three of H.J. Hansen’s ‘Ingolf’ species, originally within the genus Leptognathia, are rediagnosed, i.e. Chauliopleona amdrupii, C. armata and C. hastata. One new species, C. bamberi, from British waters is described and a new genus and species, Saurotipleona julii, is described from bathyal depths in the Irminger and Iceland basins. The latter is similar to Chauliopleona in having a sternal spur on pleonite-5 but this is of a slightly different form and is ventrally directed; it also has two superodistal spines on the propodus of pereopod-5, a distinctly plesiomorphic character in the family. A distribution map and key to the identification of these species are given.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:E7EF8C72-D1C6-438E-B9C2-A5CE637FB75A
