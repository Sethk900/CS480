Life Cycle Asset Management Methodologies for BuildingsAbstractAlthough asset management methodologies and tools related to the civil infrastructure domain have existed for decades, there are many challenges in applying these same techniques to buildings. This is because of the complexity and diversity of building structures, and their ownership profile. Numerous influences including scarcity of energy and material resources and land are creating greater awareness of the need for structured building management to reduce total life cycle needs. This reduction in consumption needs to be balanced with the requirements of the building occupant, such that building services are provided at a certain level of quality over a specified lifespan. Whether the building reaches that life and how it performs in service depends on maintenance, repair, and modernization during that timeframe, or restoration and recapitalization near the end of that timeframe. Optimal facility asset management needs to consider minimizing the life cycle costs related to these activities, while ensuring building performance levels related to condition, serviceability, safety, and capacity are met. Any decision framework should attempt to identify operational, tactical, and strategic consequences and outcomes to maximize the benefit of an investment in building facilities. The objectives of this paper are to identify the wide array of approaches to building life cycle management, review the benefits and challenges of the current state of practice, and propose a framework for achieving improved facility information for actionable facility decision support. An example case study is also provided.
