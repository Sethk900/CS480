Does interspecific competition from congeners cause the scarcity of Gerbillus henleyi in productive sandy desert habitats?.<ol><li>We tested the hypothesis that <em>Gerbillus henleyi</em> (de Winton 1903), the smallest species (10 g) of a pssamophilic guild in Israel, is scarce on relatively productive dunes of the Israeli desert, due to negative interactions from the common <em>G. allenby</em>i (Thomas 1918) and <em>G. pyramidum</em> (Geoffroy 1825).</li><li>The alternative hypothesis was that scarcity on sand resulted from the size of its naked hind feet, that do not allow efficient locomotion on sand.</li><li>Despite their naked soles the weight-bearing surface of <em>G. henleyi</em> feet carry less mass/area than those of any other species.</li><li>We measured interaction coefficients with the two common species using field-manipulation experiments in two enclosures.</li><li>Habitat usage of <em>G. henleyi</em> changed from significantly preferring the stabilized sand, when alone, to significantly using the semistabilized dune, when <em>G. allenbyi</em> was also present.</li><li>We also estimated the interaction coefficients and calculated the <em>G. henleyi</em>'s isoclines competing with the two common gerbil species using a technique we developed elsewhere.</li><li>The stability analysis of the isoclines of <em>G. henleyi</em> competing with either <em>G. allenbyi</em> or with <em>G. pyramidum</em> suggests that stable coexistence occurs when <em>G. henleyi</em> is relatively scarce while the competitors are common.</li><li>Interspecific competition from either <em>G. allenbyi</em> or <em>G. pyramidum</em> accounts for 90Â·3% reduction in <em>G. henleyi</em> density, relative to when it is alone.</li><li>We concluded that the negative interactions from congeners was the major cause for the scarcity of <em>G. henleyi</em> on the relatively rich sand dunes of the Israeli desert.</li></ol>
