Experimental and QSPR study of sorption properties of polychlorinated diphenyl sulfides (PCDPSs) in Yangtze River plain soilThis work investigates the soil sorption activity of polychlorinated diphenyl sulfides (PCDPSs) assessed by both batch equilibration and quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) methodologies. Sorption isotherms of diphenyl sulfide (DPS) and 2,4′-dichloro diphenyl sulfide (2,4′-di-CDPS) were obtained for different ionic strengths and the soil partition coefficients (logKoc) of 20 PCDPSs were determined. Compared to Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms, the linear isotherm fits are better for the low concentration sorption of DPS and 2,4′-di-CDPS. The results indicate that logKoc of the 20 PCDPSs increase along with logKow. For predicting the logKoc of 194 PCDPSs, the partial least square (PLS) method was used to generate a QSPR model with 18 descriptors. By cross validation, the model shows good verifying precision and excellent predictive ability.
