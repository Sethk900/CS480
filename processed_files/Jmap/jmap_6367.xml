Protein synthesis during osmotic stress in maizeAn experiment measuring cell membrane stability was conducted on different inbred lines of maize with known drought sensitivity or tolerance. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that a 29.5 kD polypeptide was newly synthesized in the drought sensitive inbred line F2834T in response to drought stress in mannitol. This line also showed an increase in drought tolerance between 8 and 12 hours after the application of the stress.
