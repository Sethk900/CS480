Controls over pathways of carbon efflux from soils along climate and black spruce productivity gradients in interior AlaskaSmall changes in C cycling in boreal forests can change the sign of their C balance, so it is important to gain an understanding of the factors controlling small exports like water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) fluxes from the soils in these systems. To examine this, we estimated WSOC fluxes based on measured concentrations along four replicate gradients in upland black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] BSP) productivity and soil temperature in interior Alaska and compared them to concurrent rates Of soil CO2 efflux. Concentrations of WSOC in organic and mineral horizons ranged from 4.9 to 22.7 g Cm-2 and from 1.4 to 8.4 g Cm-2, respectively. Annual WSOC fluxes (4.5-12.0 g Cm-2 y(-1)) increased with annual Soil CO2 effluxes (365-739 g Cm-2 y(-1)) across all sites (R-2 = 0.55, p=0.02), with higher fluxes occurring in warmer, more productive stands. Although annual WSOC flux was relatively small compared to total Soil CO2 efflux across all sites (< 3%), its relative contribution was highest in warmer, more productive stands which harbored less soil organic carbon. The proportions of relatively bioavailable organic fractions (hydrophilic organic matter and low molecular weight acids) were highest in WSOC in colder, low-productivity stands whereas the more degraded products of microbial activity (fulvic acids) were highest in warmer, more productive stands. These data suggest that WSOC mineralization may be a mechanism for increased soil C loss if the climate warms and therefore should be accounted for in order to accurately determine the sensitivity of boreal soil organic C balance to climate change.
