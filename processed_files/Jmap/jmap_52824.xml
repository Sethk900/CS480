Terrestrial organic matter input suppresses biomass production in lake ecosystemsTerrestrial ecosystems export large amounts of organic carbon (t-OC) but the net effect of this OC on the productivity of recipient aquatic ecosystems is largely unknown. In this study of boreal lakes, we show that the relative contribution of t-OC to individual top consumer (fish) biomass production, and to most of their potential prey organisms, increased with the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC; dominated by t-OC sources) in water. However, the biomass and production of top consumers decreased with increasing concentration of DOC, despite their substantial use (up to 60%) of t-OC. Thus, the results suggest that although t-OC supports individual consumer growth in lakes to a large extent, t-OC input suppresses rather than subsidizes population biomass production.
