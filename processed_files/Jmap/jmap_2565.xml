HABITAT PROVISIONING FOR ABOVEGROUND PREDATORS DECREASES DETRITIVORES.Although provisioning of habitat by ecosystem engineers is one of the most common biological interactions, previous studies have mostly focused on facilitative or bottom-up processes. Here we show that engineering effects can indirectly strengthen top-down effects mediated by predator abundance. We conducted a small-scale manipulative field experiment and broad-scale field observations of the plant, web spider, and detrital insect system in forest understory habitats. In the field experiment, artificially increasing architectural elements enhanced the abundance of spiders by providing physical support for web building. Moreover, aerial insects derived from the detrital food web decreased in response to increased spider abundance. As artificial architecture per se did not affect aerial detritivores, these results indicate that ecosystem engineering indirectly strengthens top-down effects mediated by predators. In field observations conducted in 12 cedar forests, path analyses supported the importance of an indirect pathway originating from understory vegetation complexity to spider abundance and to aerial detritivores. The effect size of spiders on detrital insects was similar in the field experiment and in the observations. These results indicate that the engineering effects of plants cascade to detrital insects through web spiders across different scales.
