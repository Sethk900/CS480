LATE SUMMER SPRING MOVEMENTS OF JUVENILE SAGE GROUSEate summer to early spring movements of radio-marked juvenile Sage Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) were studied on Cold Spring Mountain, northwestern Colorado, from July to February 1981-82 and August to May 1982-83. Movements were analyzed from 118 locations (N = 8 grouse) during July-November 1981 and 213 locations (N = 10 grouse) during August-November 1982. Grouse steadily moved away from capture sites until November each year when they moved to winter-use sites. Movements to wintering areas in late November were related to snowfall and subsequent availability of sagebrush. Maximum one-way distance to wintering areas was 30.3 km (N = 4 radio-marked grouse). Sage Grouse generally followed topographic features and avoided areas without sagebrush cover, although they were capable of long-distance (23 km) movements over areas without shrub cover. During spring recruitment there appeared to be roving groups of males, probably yearlings, that spent much of the breeding season displaying near females away from tra- ditional leks
