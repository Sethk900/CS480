Description of juvenile stages and adults of two new nothroid mites from Ecuador (Acari: Oribatida: Nothridae)The morphology of juvenile stages and adults of two new Neotropical oribatid mites from Ecuador is described and illustrated: Nothrus cotopaxiensis n. sp. and N. glaesarius n. sp. Comparison is made with juvenile stages and adults of similar species: Ethiopian species N. ifeensis Badejo, Woas and Beck, 2002, Japanese N. meakanensis Fujikawa, 1999 and N. silvestris Nicolet, 1855. Specimens were found in samples of moss, soil, litter, detritus from the forest patch, from under dwarf shrubs, below shrubs bordering the creek and in cushion plants. All samples were collected from Ecuador (provinces Pichincha, Imbabura and Cotopaxi, at 2750–3900 m a.s.l.).
