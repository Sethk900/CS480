Use of UAV oblique imaging for detection of individual trees in residential environmentsOblique imaging and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are two state-of-the-art remote sensing (RS) techniques that are undergoing explosive development. While their synthesis means more possibilities for applications such as urban forestry and urban greening, the related methods for data processing and information extraction, e.g. individual tree detection, are still in short supply. In order to help fill this technical gap, this study focused on developing a new method applicable for detection of individual trees in UAV oblique images. The planned algorithm is composed of three steps: 1) classification based on K-means clustering and RGB-based vegetation index derivation to acquire vegetation cover maps, 2) suggestion of new feature parameters by synthesizing texture and color parameters to identify vegetation distribution, 3) individual tree detection based on marker-controlled watershed segmentation and shape analysis. The evaluations based on the images within residential environments indicated that the commission and omission errors are less than 32% and 26%, respectively. The results have basically validated the proposed method.  The positive results of the test basically validated the algorithm developed for detection of individual trees directly in UAV-collected individual oblique images of residential environments. The proposed new feature parameter that synthesizes the common feature parameters of texture and RGB brightness displayed the capability of exposing trees. Overall, this work proved to help fill the technical gap between the vigorous progress of UAV oblique imaging and its limited applications on object information extraction such as for urban forestry and urban greening.
