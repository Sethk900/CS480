Den selection by the giant panda in Foping Nature Reserve, ChinaThe natal den is important to reproduction success of the giant panda Ailuropoda melanoleuca. In this study, we tested the differences between natal dens of the giant panda and reference caves by three statistical methods, and derived the main factors influencing den selection by the giant pandas by principal component analysis (PCA). The results of difference tests indicated that nine variables, including visibility at a height of 1Â m, rain proofing, aspect, position, gradient, canopy cover, coverage of bamboo, distance to water and human disturbance were significantly different. The result of PCA indicated that canopy cover was the most important factor in natal den selection by giant pandas. Distance to water, coverage of bamboo and degree of rain proofing were also important factors determining den selection by the giant pandas in Foping Nature Reserve.
