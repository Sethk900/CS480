Water Movement in a glossaqualf as measured by two tracersThe relationships between soil organization and water movement were investigated in a Glossaqualf. This soil is characterized by a clear discontinuity between the tongues and the matrix in both material (texture and mineralogy), and structure (porosity and pedality). Two tracer approaches have been used to evaluate water movement: (1) methylene blue for studying the transfer in saturated conditions in the field and on undisturbed cores; and (2) an environmental isotope (oxygen-18) for studying the actual behaviour under natural conditions. The different approaches show that tongues are preferential paths of water transfer; the matrix is nearly short-circuited under saturated conditions. Analogous results were obtained in the laboratory and under natural conditions. These results are attributed to the shapes, sizes, distribution and overall continuity of the system of pores.
