Influence of Plant Functional Group Removal on Inorganic Soil Nitrogen Concentrations in Native Grasslands.High plant functional group diversity has been hypothesized to reduce resource concentrations based on the assumption that species from one functional group acquire resources similarly to one another, while species from other functional groups acquire resources dissimilarly. To determine if functional groups use soil nutrients different from one another, we investigated the impact of removing individual functional groups on soil inorganic nitrogen (NOâˆ’3 and NH+4) concentrations in the Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis Elmer)/bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata [Pursh] A. LÃ¶ve) habitat type in Montana. Treatments were imposed by removing 1) all plant species (total plant removal), 2) shallow-rooted (<15 cm) forbs, 3) deep-rooted (>15 cm) forbs, 4) all forbs (total forb removal), 5) grasses, and 6) spikemoss, compared to intact control plots. Inorganic nitrogen was measured at 2 soil depths (0-15 cm and 16-40 cm) in the spring, summer, and fall 1 year after treatment imposition. The remo...
