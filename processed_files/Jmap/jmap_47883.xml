Relative Effectiveness of Repellents for Reducing Mule Deer DamageWe tested the repellency of chicken eggs, MGK Big Game Repellent (BGR), coyote (Canis latrans) urine, thiram, Hinder, bars of soap, and Ro-pel on tame mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in Colorado during May and June 1989. Chicken eggs, BGR, and coyote urine performed better than the other repellents for deterring deer from feeding on pelleted rations. Consumption of rations treated with odor repellents increased from Day 1 through Day 4 of the trial, but consumption of thiram-treated rations decreased. The repellency of eggs, BGR, and coyote urine was reduced when apple twigs were sprayed with 7 cm of water to simulate heavy rainfall. When the deer were moderately hungry, even the best performing repellents failed to deter browsing.
