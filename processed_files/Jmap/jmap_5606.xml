Revision of the genus Chordodes (Gordiida, Nematomorpha) from Africaâ€”III: ultrastructural redescription of Chordodes capensis Camerano, 1895, C. clavatus Linstow, 1906, C. digitatus Linstow, 1901, C. tuberculatus Linstow, 1901, and reinterpretation of C. Six species of the genus Chordodes from Africa are investigated in order to certify the taxonomic descriptions and verify the species status. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrates that the males of Chordodes clavatus and C. digitatus have five types of areoles, while the females of C. clavatus have seven areolar types and the females of C. digitatus have six areolar types. Chordodes capensis also shows this sexual dimorphism, as males have four types of areoles and females have five areolar types. The cuticle of Chordodes tuberculatus contains three areolar types. Chordodes ibembensis and C. uncinatus are synonimized with C. clavatus, because no differences can be detected that justify these species as valid.
