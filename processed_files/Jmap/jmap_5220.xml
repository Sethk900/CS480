Establishment of a new subfamily for Shenius anomalus (Shen, 1935) (Crustacea: Decapoda: Brachyura: Dotillidae)Shenius anomalus (Shen, 1935) has previously been assigned to the Macrophthalmidae Dana, 1851, and the Camptandriidae Stimpson, 1858. A close examination of adult and first stage zoeal morphology confirms some previous suggestions that S. anomalus is actually an anomalous member of the Dotillidae Stimpson, 1858. However, because a number of distinctive features distinguish it from all other dotillid genera a new subfamily Sheniinae is established.
