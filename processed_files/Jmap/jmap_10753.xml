Retention Time of Telazol in Black BearsTelazolÂ® (Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA) is an effective immobilization drug for American black bears (Ursus americanus), but concern exists regarding retention time of this drug in tissues relative to human consumption of bears. Therefore, we evaluated retention time of Telazol in captured American black bears immobilized with Telazol and held in captivity for 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, or 21 days. We detected Telazol in muscle and liver of one bear on day 7, in serum from 2 bears on day 7, and in urine of one bear each on day 3 and day 14. Our findings suggest Telazol is metabolized and eliminated quickly from the bear's system and should allow managers additional flexibility in mark-recapture studies and nuisance situations.
