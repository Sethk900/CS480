Effects of the Surrounding Matrix on Tree Recruitment in Amazonian Forest Fragments.Little is known about how the surrounding modified matrix affects tree recruitment in fragmented forests. We contrasted effects of two different matrix types,<em> Vismia</em>- and<em> Cecropia</em>-dominated regrowth, on recruitment of pioneer tree species in forest fragments in central Amazonia. Our analyses were based on 22, 1-ha plots in seven experimental forest fragments ranging in size from 1 to 100 ha. By 13 to 17 years after fragmentation, the population density of pioneer trees was significantly higher in plots surrounded by<em> Vismia </em>regrowth than in plots surrounded by<em> Cecropia </em>regrowth, and the species composition and dominance of pioneers differed markedly between the two matrix types.<em> Cecropia sciadophylla </em>was the most abundant pioneer in fragments surrounded by<em> Cecropia </em>regrowth (constituting nearly 50% of all pioneer trees), whereas densities of species in<em> Vismia</em>-surrounded fragments were distributed more evenly. Thus the surrounding matrix had a strong influence on patterns of tree recruitment in Amazonian forest fragments.
