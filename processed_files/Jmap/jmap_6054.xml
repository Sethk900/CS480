An evaluation of three Sr27-carrying wheat Ã— rye translocationsNear isogenic lines differing for the presence or absence of group 3 wheat x rye translocations were developed in three wheat varieties. These included a non-compensating 3AS.3RS translocation and two compensating translocations with constitutions 3AL.3RS and 3BL.3RS. Results of a yield trial suggest that each translocation is associated with a sizeable yield penalty and is unlikely to be of use in breeding in its present form.
