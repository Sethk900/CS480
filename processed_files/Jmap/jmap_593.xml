Estimated soil organic carbon change due to agricultural land management modifications in a semiarid cereal-growing region in Central SpainMaintaining or increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) in agricultural lands is important for soil productivity, restoration and could potentially be a factor in reducing carbon emissions. In order to implement best practices for maintaining productivity and increasing SOC, there is a need for understanding how management changes may alter SOC levels. This applied study presents a methodology to assess and predict SOC levels to better understand effects modification to land management can have in semiarid central Spain. Results show extensification using longer-term pasture rotations (e.g. 5-year) could increase SOC levels and have an impact on soil restoration important in maintaining productivity. SOC increases brought about by new management may also have a role in contribution to national carbon emission reduction plans.
