Diffusive-Wave Based Hydrologic-Hydraulic Model with Sediment Transport. II: Validation and Practical ApplicationAbstractThe development of a distributed two-dimensional (2D) hydrologic-hydraulic simulation model was presented in Paper I. The simulation model combined overland flow (kinematic/diffusive wave models), hillslope sediment transport, and groundwater flow apart from the water exchange mechanisms between zones. Particular attention was paid to the upwind discretization of the surface flow equations. In this paper, the proposed model is validated by using four test cases with exact solutions, one academic test case, and two laboratory test cases. The model adequately reproduced front advance over dry beds of any slope and water table evolution in simple cases. As practical application of the model, the simulation of real events in two experimental basins is also presented. The work is focused on the influence of the choice of the empirical parameters on the model results concerning solid and liquid discharges. Also, because of the lack of information referring the boundary and initial conditions of the groundwater flow in real basins, it is difficult to evaluate the accuracy of the complete model.
