Ground Movements from Aquifer Recharge and RecoveryAbstractThis paper deals with ground response to surface water infiltration from an aquifer storage and recovery facility in Arizona. It presents a coupled groundwater flowâ€“soil deformation model to investigate the role of low-hydraulic conductive materials (LHCMs), such as clays and silts, on the spatial and temporal flow and ground response. Finite element analyses were conducted that simulated the flow from surface injection ponds into the ground with and without LHCMs. The results showed that the presence of LHCMs significantly influences the flow path and the ground surface deformation profile.
