A review of research achievements on maize stem borer, Busseola fusca (Fuller) and Diplodia ear rot caused by Stenocarpella maydis (Berk. Sutton)Research that focused on maize production on the central Highveld of South Africa was traditionally, since the early twentieth century, dealt with by the Department of Agriculture at Potchefstroom. During the 1970s the Highveld Region at Potchefstroom assigned a group of researchers with an interest in maize to a unit termed the Summer Grain Centre that in 1992 became part of the Agricultural Research Councilâ€™s Grain Crops Institute. Members of this group in particular gave research attention to various aspects of crop protection in maize, including the soil insect complex, the maize stem borer complex, maize streak disease, the ear rot complex and various leaf diseases. This paper deals with research progress on the African stem borer, Busseola fusca, and ear rot caused by Stenocarpella maydis. The emphasis is on research with a practical application rather than that of an academic nature.
