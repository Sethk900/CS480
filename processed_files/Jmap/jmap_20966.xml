A remarkable new genus of leafhoppers (Hemiptera, Cicadellidae, Iassinae) from Southeast AsiaAbstract Tardrabassus pakneunensis, n. gen. & sp. is described and illustrated. The new genus shows morphological affinities to three leafhopper subfamilies, Tartessinae, Deltocephalinae, and Iassinae, but is tentatively placed in Iassinae based on the position of the ocelli, the reduced lateral frontal sutures, the leg chaetotaxy, and the structure of the male genitalia.
