Die in stehenden Gew√§ssern der Neotropis verbreitete Chironomidengattung Goeldichironomus Fittkau (Diptera, Insecta)Summary The chironomid genus Goeldichironomus is distributed in the subtropical and tropical areas of Middle and South America. In addition to the two known species G. holoprasinus and amazonicus, it includes at present five others described as new species. A key for all three stages of metamorphosis is provided. Three species groups can be distinguished and their relationships are discussed, mainly with respect to new features of the larval head. The holarctic genus Glyptotendipes is probably the sister group of Goeldichironomus. The juvenile stages live in relatively nutrient‚Ärich standing water bodies, and generally avoid the extremely electrolyte‚Äpoor, acid, humic blackwaters of the neo‚Ätropics. Except for G. amazonicus, which is a benthic species characteristic of Middle American eutrophic lakes and ponds, all species occur in the extensively investigated v√°rzea of central Amazonia, where they are the typical species of standing water in littoral biotopes. G. pictus, natans and serratus are common species of floating meadows, in which massive populations can develop. G. holoprasinus is confined to small temporary water bodies. G. xiborena exclusively inhabits rotting leaves of Victoria regia. In the v√°rzea lakes the species fluctuans is found only on small dead pieces of vegetation drifting on the water surface. On these almost the entire larval and complete pupal development occurs.
