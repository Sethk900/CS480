Influence of stand density on soil CO2 efflux for a Pinus densiflora forest in KoreaWe investigated the influence of stand density [938 tree ha(-1) for high stand density (HD), 600 tree ha(-1) for medium stand density (MD), and 375 tree ha(-1) for low stand density (LD)] on soil CO2 efflux (R (S)) in a 70-year-old natural Pinus densiflora S. et Z. forest in central Korea. Concurrent with R (S) measurements, we measured litterfall, total belowground carbon allocation (TBCA), leaf area index (LAI), soil temperature (ST), soil water content (SWC), and soil nitrogen (N) concentration over a 2-year period. The R (S) (t C ha(-1) year(-1)) and leaf litterfall (t C ha(-1) year(-1)) values varied with stand density: 6.21 and 2.03 for HD, 7.45 and 2.37 for MD, and 6.96 and 2.23 for LD, respectively. In addition, R (S) was correlated with ST (R (2) = 0.77-0.80, P < 0.001) and SWC (R (2) = 0.31-0.35, P < 0.001). It appeared that stand density influenced R (S) via changes in leaf litterfall, LAI and SWC. Leaf litterfall (R (2) = 0.71), TBCA (R (2) = 0.64-0.87), and total soil N contents in 2007 (R (2) = 0.94) explained a significant amount of the variance in R (S) (P < 0.01). The current study showed that stand density is one of the key factors influencing R (S) due to the changing biophysical and environmental factors in P. densiflora.
