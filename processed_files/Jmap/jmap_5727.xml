Physical factors influencing Muscidae and Pimelia sp. (Tenebrionidae) infestation of Loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) nests on Dalaman Beach, TurkeyThe physical factors affecting the infestation of individual loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) nests by Muscidae and Pimelia sp. were determined in the 2002 and 2003 hatching seasons on Dalaman Beach, Turkey. The data were collected from the middle of July to the middle of September in both years. The most significant factor, by tâ€test, for Pimelia sp., was the distance of the nest from vegetation (P<0.001), and the most significant factor for Muscidae was the depth from the surface to the egg chamber (P<0.001). The distances of nests from vegetation were found to be significant factors for both Pimelia sp. and Muscidae. For conservation, it should be noted that the relocation of nests from the water's edge to further inland or to a hatchery site closer to vegetation may increase insect infestation and reduce hatching success.
