Two new Korean earthworms (Annelida, Oligochaeta, Megadrilacea, Megascolecidae)Abstract Two Korean endemic pheretimoid Amynthas Kinberg, 1867 species belonging in family Megascolecidae s. stricto are sketched, dissected and described. Amynthas daeari Blakemore sp. n. has spermathecae in 6/7/8 complying with an Amynthas tokioensis spp-group, whilst Amynthas jinburi Blakemore sp. n. has spermathecal pores in 5 & 6 strictly complying with Sims and Eastonâ€™s (1972) Amynthas canaliculatus-group. A definitive COI gene barcode is provided for the holotype of Amynthas daeari but the age since collection or preservation of the Amynthas jinburi type in 2000 precluded its mtDNA extraction at this time.
