The weathering of biotite in a profile on gneiss in MalaysiaBiotite and its pseudomorphs were studied in a deep profile on gneiss from Malaysia. Alteration of biotite to halloysite takes place within a few centimeters of the fresh rock (at 18.5 m depth) in this humid tropical environment. The halloysite crystals are arranged parallel to the planar surface of the biotite (SEM studies) in the interlamellar spaces. There are zones in the profile where iron has accumulated and some of the iron crystallises as goethite on the edges and surfaces of the flakes. Once this coating has formed, further alteration is retarded as is shown by the fact that pseudomorphs with the coating contain both halloysite and vermiculite though the environment where they are present (position in the profile) is acidic and leaching.
