Relationships between yield, base temperature and drought resistance in grain sorghumThe object of this study was to investigate the interrelationship between yield, its components, base temperature and drought resistance of grain sorghum. Seven commercial cultivars and 27 F1 progenies were compared in two separate randomized block trials. A total of 24 characteristics were evaluated and their association was determined by simple correlation and path coefficient techniques. The results suggested that simultaneous selection for more than one characteristic is possible. Drought resistance and base temperature were indicated to have an important bearing on grain yield and its components.
