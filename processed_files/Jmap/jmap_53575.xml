Contribution to the knowledge of the genus Zygaena Fabricius, 1775, in Iran (Lepidoptera, Zygaenidae). Part X: On two newly discovered Mesembrynus taxa from the western AlborzTwo well-defined Zygaena taxa are described from the central Alborz range in Iran and are placed as subspecies of two known Mesembrynus species. Both taxa inhabit biotopes on the northern side of the main Alborz range, areas that are climatically influenced by the Caspian Sea. Zygaena speciosa oseyii ssp. n. is represented by the most north-westerly populations of Z. speciosa Reiss, 1937, from Kuh-e Samamus, Gardaneh-ye Tondrokosh and from Kuh-e Khash-Chal, all of which are characterized by the absence of melanistic forms, while the nominotypical populations exhibit only melanistic forms. Zygaena tamara dailamica ssp. n. differs from all known populations of Z. tamara by having a different red coloration while the red abdominal cingulum is restricted to one segment. Moreover, consistent differences are found in the larval phenotype although several cross-breedings (Z. tamara tamara Christoph, 1889 Ã— Z. tamara dailamica ssp. n.) were successful.
