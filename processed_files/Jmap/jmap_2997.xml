Effects of deer, mice and dwarf bamboo on the emergence, survival and growth of Abies homolepis (Piceaceae) seedlingsIn the subalpine mixed forest of Mt. Odaigahara, mid-western Japan, the understory is dominated by dwarf bamboo (Sasa nipponica), which is the major forage of overly populous sika deer (Cervus nippon). In the present study, we monitored the survival and growth of Abies homolepis seedlings over 5 years to determine how they responded to the experimental removal of dwarf bamboo and to the exclusion of sika deer and mice (Apodemus argenteus and A. speciosus). Deer and dwarf bamboo reduced the survival of seedlings but had different effects on growth. The stems of seedlings were shorter in the presence of deer, indicating that taller seedlings were apt to be browsed by deer, whereas the diameters of seedlings were smaller in the presence of dwarf bamboo, mainly owing to its shading effect. The presence of mice decreased the number of seedlings germinating in a particular site, but had no effect on seedling survival after germination. There was no significant indirect effect whereby the survival of seedlings was predicted to be facilitated by the decreased biomass of bamboo because of grazing by deer. We supposed that this might be because the direct negative effect of deer was so large as to conceal the positive indirect effect.
