Influences of interyear rainfall variability and microhabitat on the germinable seed bank of annual plants in a sandy Monte Desert.We addressed the effects of growing-season rainfall of two consecutive years and of two microhabitats on seed density and floristic composition of the germinable seed bank of annual plants in a sandy desert. We hypothesised that seed composition and density is affected by the presence of vegetated patches, but that this effect varies according to rainfall. We predict an overall lower soil-seed density with higher values under shrubs after a dry growing season.
