Aegla rostrata n. sp., (Decapoda, Aeglidae), nuevo crust√°ceo dulceacu√≠cola del Sur de ChileSummary Aegla rostrata n. sp. (Decapoda, Aeglidae), a new freshwater crustacean from Southern Chile The description of Aegla rostrata n. sp. a new species of Aegla from lakes and rivers of the Valdivia basin (Provincia de Valdivia, Chile) is given. Its characteristics being: rostrum long, narrow, styli‚Äform and quitinous tipped, exceeding by 2 to 21/2 times the length of the corneas. Protogastric prominences squamous and well marked. Posterior branchial margin expanded and recurved. Palmar crest wide, subrectangular and broadly serrated. Externally A. rostrata resembles A. denticulata Nicolet, 1849, but differs from the last because it lacks the longitudinal carina along the dorsum of the carapace and the median tubercule on the fourth toracic sternum. A. rostrata has been found in the lakes Ri√±ihue, Panguipulli and Calafqu√©n, as well as in rivers Calle Calle and Huanahu√©. In the lake Ri√±ihue A. rostrata has been collected from the litoral to depths of 320 m. This distribution makes it the second species of the genus inhabiting lacustrine habitats. It is also the first of which the complete batimetric range is known, at least in its type locality. It is suggested that te present distribution of A. rostrata has been attained after the ice melting of the pleistocene glaciation.
