Variation of agronomic traits of potato somaclones produced by meristem cultureFollowing a thermotherapy virus eradication procedure potato plantlets were multiplied as meristem clones in vitro. The agronomic traits of meristem clones were compared in field trials over three years. A total of 16 meristem clones of cultivar Agric dzeltenie and 10 of cultivar Juku were evaluated. There was a significant variation in the number and size of tubers per plant amongst clones. The yield of clones of cultivar Agric dzeltenie varied from 32.4 to 51.41 ha−1 and for cultivar Juku from 27.4 to 33.5 and 6.11 ha−1. Previous studies with other cultivars indicated that meristem clones may differ in starch content of tubers and in disease tolerance. It is possible to improve the agronomic traits of potato cultivars by selecting meristem clones with suitable characteristics. This phenomenon can be used in seed potato production programmes and in plant breeding.
