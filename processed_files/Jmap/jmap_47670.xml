Diversity and nectar hosts of flower-settling moths within a Florida sandhill ecosystemThe purpose of this study was to document and identify flower-settling moths within a Florida sandhill ecosystem and investigate their potential pollination capabilities. A combination of methods incorporating observation, morphology, pollen analysis and behaviour were applied. Fifty-two species of moths were documented taking nectar on flowers. A novel nectar-feeding behaviour categorized as fluttering resulted in increased pollen collection. Significant morphological match of moth proboscis length with flower corolla length was found. A preliminary list of sandhill moths is presented, and a pollen library of flowers found throughout the study area was created. This study was the first to conduct observations of settling moths in upland pine communities, and offers a rare glimpse into the interactions of moths with flowers within a unique ecosystem.
