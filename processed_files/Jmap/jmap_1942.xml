Spatial heterogeneity of ecosystem carbon fluxes in a broadleaved forest in Northern Germany.Carbon fluxes were investigated in a mature deciduous forest, located in Northern Germany (53°47&prime;N-10°36&prime;E), by means of eddy-covariance technique, stand survey and models. This forest has been managed following a concept of nature-oriented forestry since the 1980s. One of the goals of the study was to test whether changed management led to increased carbon sequestration. The forest contains several broadleaved tree species. Depending on wind direction, the fetch-area of the eddy-covariance data was dominated by different tree species. Three subplots dominated by Oak, Beech or Alder/Ash could be distinguished from the tower data. In each of these subplots, 30 &times; 30 m<sup>2</sup> areas were defined to analyse leaf area index, litterfall and the increase of the wood biomass.
