Forest vegetation and origin of some spodic horizons, MichiganThree well-drained soils that differ in Bs horizon properties occur on sandy, glacial deposits in northern Michigan, U.S.A. Each horizon was sampled and analyzed for chemical and physical properties in order to examine B horizon formation. Extractable C, Al and Fe were found to increase from the lightest to the darkest colored B horizons. Differences in B horizon properties could not be explained by elemental composition of the C horizons, particle size distribution, topography or climate. Formation of the B horizons appears to be a function of forest vegetation. We conclude that fire frequency played a role in the formation of the B horizons by influencing forest successional events.
