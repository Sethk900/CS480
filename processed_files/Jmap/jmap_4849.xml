The behaviour of orientation of openings of burrows by Liolaemus lutzae (Squamata: Liolaemidae): is it influenced by environmental factors?Liolaemus lutzae is a lizard species distributed along the coast of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Individuals of this species dig burrows in the sandy substrate of restingas for shelter. We analysed whether the behaviour of L. lutzae directing the openings of their burrows was affected by environmental factors in two protected restinga areas: the Reserva Ecológica Estadual de Jacarepiá and the Parque Natural Municipal de Grumari. The openings of the burrows were located mainly close to the seashore (possibly because of less compacted substrate and/or differences in microenvironmental temperatures), and predominantly in terrains with slope. The behaviour by L. lutzae of orienting the entrance of their burrows in the descendent direction of the terrain slope may be advantageous by rendering them less vulnerable to potential threats and disturbances coming from the surface, due to being located deeper in the sand compared with burrows built on flat terrains.
