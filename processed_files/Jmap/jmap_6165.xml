Die invloed van die voginhoud op die dopbaarheid van sonneblomsaadThe effect of moisture content on the hullability of sunflower seed. The moisture content of sunflower seed {Helianthus annuns L.) used for crushing, varies between 5.5% (the lower level of natural drying) and 10% (the maximum allowable moisture content for storage). The aim of this experiment was to determine the effect of seed moisture content on the hullability, with the huller speed adjusted for minimising the amount of unhulled seeds plus fine material. Seed samples from two cultivars grown at Heilbron during 1996/97 were used. Dehulling with a centrifugal laboratory dehuller was done at intervals, while the seed was left to dry naturally. Drier seed needs a lower speed for optimum dehulling. Hullability increased from 88% to 95% as seed moisture content dropped from 9.5% to 5.7%. Simultaneously the amount of fine material and associated loss of oil and protein increased with different amounts for the tw.o.Â§eed samples used. If the fine material can be retrieved, hullabilty would be the highest at the lowest possibie*moisture content
