Scarification and stratification of Combretum erythrophyllum (Burchell) seed and fruit for uniformity in germinationDifferent scarification and stratification processes were used to soften River Bushwillow or Combretum etythrophyllun (Burchell) fruit and seed coverings and to determine the percentage, rate and uniformity of germination. Treatments included stratification, hot water scarification, leaching in cold water, soaking in a Nitrosol solution (Nitrosol is a product manufactured by Fleuron Pty. Ltd.) and a control. The hot water treatment improved gennination rate of both the seeds and the samaras more than the other treatments used. Removal of the seed covering (pericarp) and scarification with hot water improved gennination rate and uniformity.
