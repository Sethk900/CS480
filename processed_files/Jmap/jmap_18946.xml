Soil surface CO2 fluxes in a Norway spruce standThe measurements of soil CO2 efflux in a Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forest stand are reported for a 6-month period (from May 1st to October 26th 1999). Forest floor CO2 efflux was measured at four positions using a portable infrared gas analyser (LI-COR), operating as a closed dynamic system and connected to a portable soil chamber. Soil CO2 efflux was measured 3-4 times per month. Soil temperature at a depth of 5 cm was recorded during the whole period with an interval of ten minutes. An exponential regression was used to describe the relationship between soil temperature and soil CO2 efflux. On the basis of this relationship Q10 values were calculated. The averaged value of Q10 for the studied Norway spruce forest stand was 3.74.
