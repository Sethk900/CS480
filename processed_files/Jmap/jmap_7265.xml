Diet comparisons between savannah reedâ€pond Gambusia sexradiata and Gambusia puncticulata yucatana (deepâ€bodied form) (Pisces: Poeciliidae) on two dates during the dry seasonWe compare the diets of reedâ€pond Gambusia sexradiata and G. puncticulata yucatana (deepâ€bodied form) collected on two dates, spaced by one month, during the dry season. The mean number of food items per individual declined while the mean food item volume increased correspondingly between dates for both Gambusia species. Gambusia p. yucatana (db) always consumed fewer, larger items than G. sexradiata. Total diet volume was less for G. sexradiata on the second date and the diet overlap coefficient, CÎ», decreased from 0.85 to 0.67 between dates. Speciesâ€specific trophic responses were demonstrated by nonâ€equivalent shifts in prey type use between dates. These results are compared with other studies of the resource use of Central American Gambusia.
