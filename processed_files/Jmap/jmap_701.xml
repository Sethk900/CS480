Diurnal and seasonal patterns of gas exchange and carbon gain contribution of leaves and stems of Justicia californica in the Sonoran Desert.Several studies have explored the contribution of stem photosynthesis to the total carbon gain of desert plants, but they have been limited to narrow desert systems in extra tropical regions. To have a better understanding of the role of photosynthetic stems in carbon fixation for tropical deserts, it is important to extend our studies into areas with different ecological conditions. This study compared the photosynthetic capacity, and seasonal variation of gas exchange of leaves and stems of Justicia californica, in the southern Sonoran Desert. It also compared their relative contribution to carbon gain, and their photosynthetic response to seasonal changes in xylem tension and vapor pressure deficit (VPD).
