Three new species of Potamothrix (Oligochaeta, Naididae, Tubificinae) from Fuxian Lake, the deepest lake of Yunnan Province, Southwest ChinaAbstract Three new species of Potamothrix Vejdovský & Mrázek, 1902 (Oligochaeta: Tubificinae), Potamothrix praeprostatus sp. n., Potamothrix paramoldaviensis sp. n. and Potamothrix parabedoti sp. n., are reported from Fuxian Lake of Yunnan Province, Southwest China. Potamothrix praeprostatusdiffers from its allies by its prostate glands joining atria in its proximal to middle portion, and spermathecal chaetae. Potamothrix paramoldaviensis is distinguishable from its allies by having penial chaeta but no penes, and differs from Potamothrix moldaviensisby its homogenous atrium. Potamothrix parabedoti is distinctive in the position of its reproductive organs, and differs from Potamothrix bedoti by its homogenous atrium. Hitherto, 34 freshwater oligochaete species have been recorded in Yunnan Province, including nine endemic species from the plateau lakes.
