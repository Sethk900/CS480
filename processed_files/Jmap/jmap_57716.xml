Coupled Hydrologic-Hydraulic Modeling of the Upper Paraguay River BasinAbstractThis paper presents a detailed modeling of rainfall-runoff processes and flow routing along a complex large-scale region, the Upper Paraguay River Basin (UPRB), encompassing a drainage area of approximately 600,000  km2, which extends over Brazil, Paraguay, and Bolivia. Within the UPRB lies the Pantanal, the world’s largest wetland, with extraordinary biodiversity and great ecologic value, but which currently is threatened by anthropogenic activities. A conceptual model was applied with two main components: (1) simulation of the basin and part of the Paraguay River tributaries by means of the distributed large-scale hydrological model MGB-IPH using simpler flow routing methods; and (2) simulation of the main drainage network, approximately 4,800 km of river reaches, with a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model. Despite the data scarcity, complexity, and the intricate river drainage network of the region, the coupled model was able to represent the hydrological regime of the basin. Comparisons between observed and calculated hydrographs showed a good model skill in representing the flow regime of the upper Paraguay River and its tributaries, highlighting its value as a tool for understanding and predicting the system behavior. The proposed modeling of the hydrological processes of the UPRB, with a detail never presented before, provides a valuable tool for understanding ecosystem functioning and assessing its resilience to anthropogenic pressure, climate change, and climate variability.
