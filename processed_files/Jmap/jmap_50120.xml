Winter-active wolf spiders (Araneae: Lycosidae) in thermal habitats from western RomaniaShores of channels with thermal water provide an adequate microclimate for maintaining wolf spiders in activity during winter. Of the spiders collected after the winter survey of 22 thermal habitats from western Romania, 93.02% were juveniles and subadults, while the remaining individuals belonged to the following seven species: Arctosa leopardus, Pardosa amentata, Pardosa proxima, Pirata piraticus, Piratula latitans, Trochosa robusta and Trochosa ruricola. The reproductive period of some species is altered under the influence of neighbouring hot waters, as revealed by the capture of females with egg sacs and spiderlings, during winter.
