Sexual dimorphism, reproduction and diet of the casque-headed treefrog Itapotihyla langsdorffii (Hylidae: Lophiohylini)Itapotihyla langsdorffii is a large â€œcasque-headedâ€ treefrog (Hylidae: Lophiohylini) found along most of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome. We studied some aspects of the ecology of a population of I. langsdorffii from the EstaÃ§Ã£o BiolÃ³gica de Santa LÃºcia, in EspÃ­rito Santo State, southeastern Brazil. Itapotihyla langsdorffii shows considerable sexual size dimorphism, with females (mean snout-vent length 103Â mm) being significantly larger than males (mean snout-vent length 81Â mm). This species is an explosive breeder with a generalized reproductive mode and has a mean brood size of over 6000 eggs. It feeds on few, large prey, with orthopterans being the dominant items in the diet, though even smaller frogs may occasionally be preyed upon. We discuss our data, making comparisons with other Neotropical hylids, with emphasis on other species in the Tribe Lophiohylini.
