The pre-overwintering nests and the immature stages of the hornet Vespa fumida van der Vecht (Hymenoptera: Vespidae)The pre-overwintering nest structure and the immature stages of the hornet Vespa fumida van der Vecht are for the first time reported. All three adult forms (queen, worker and drone) are briefly described. The eggs have many micropyles concentrated at the larger end of the egg. The mature larvae can be identified by having the ecdysial sulcus obliterated ventrally; the parietal band distinctly margined ventrally on the outer side; the palate with a median patch and a pair of dorsal patches; the collar processes of the spiracle long and thick, with many branches over almost all the surface. Morphology and distribution of the different types of sensilla (setae, conical papillae, campaniform sensilla, basiconic sensilla, etc.) and the spicules are illustrated in detail. Close relationship between the Vespa affinis-group and V. fumida previously suggested by adult morphology is briefly discussed in terms of the morphology of the mature larvae.
