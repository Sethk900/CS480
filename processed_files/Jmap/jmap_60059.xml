Principal Factor Analysis for Forecasting Diurnal Water-Demand Pattern Using Combined Rough-Set and Fuzzy-Clustering TechniqueAbstractThe true principal factors for the diurnal water-demand pattern of urban water are often difficult to identify using traditional rough-set algorithms because the demand pattern is usually affected by many factors that are uncertain and hard to quantify. An improved attribute-reduction algorithm based on the cumulative weighting coefficient was proposed to solve this problem. The weighting coefficient was determined by the result of the variable precision rough-set algorithm. To discuss the consecutive curves with mathematical tools, an improved fuzzy c-mean (FCM) algorithm was proposed to discretize the diurnal water-demand pattern spatially. The proposed algorithms were then used to analyze the principal factors of the diurnal water-demand pattern in the city of Hangzhou, China. The results show that the improved attribute-reduction algorithm is capable of distinguishing the false attribute from the dynamic reduction sets, and the fuzzy c-mean algorithm is an effective and feasible method of solving the cluster problem for the consecutive curves. The principal factors affecting the diurnal water-demand pattern in Hangzhou are maximum air temperature, minimum air temperature, and weekday or weekend.
