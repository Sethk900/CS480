Die pelagischen Ostracoden der MARCHILE Iâ€Expedition (SÃ¼dostâ€Pazifik), I: Verbreitung, Zoogeographie und Bedeutung als Indikatoren fÃ¼r WasserkÃ¶rper. (Crust., Ostracoda: Myodocopida)Abstract The pelagic Ostracods of the MARCHILE Iâ€Expedition were studied from samples collected during February and March 1960 off the Chilean coast between 30Â° S and 42Â° S. The study area in the Peruâ€Chile Coastal Current had a length of more than 1500 km and a breadth of 250 km. The upper 200 m (Epipelagial) consisted of five water masses characterized by different values of temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen. Two of these water masses were associated with zones of upwelling. The horizontal spatial distributions of six very abundant species are uniquely associated with specific water masses, as follows: Subtropical Surface Water and Porroecia porrecta pacifica. Antiboreal Water (=Subantarctic Surface Water) and Orthoconchoecia haddoni marchilensis. Low Salinity Water and Conchoecia lophura lissoides. Equatorial Subsurface Water (=GÃ¼nther Current) and Conchoecetta giesbrechti giesbrechti. Subantarctic Subsurface Water and Pseudoconchoecia serrulata. Upwelling areas of Antiboreal Water and Orthoconchoecia striola striola. These Ostracods seem to be endemic to these particular water masses, and since they also tend to submerge with sinking of the water masses, they can be considered as indicators of the entire extent of those water masses. Zoogeographically the area which was sampled represents a convergence zone for several different faunal assemblages. The data available indicate the locations of the southern limit of subtropical and equatorial species, the northern limit of subantarctic and antiborealâ€cold species, and the extension of antiborealâ€warm forms.
