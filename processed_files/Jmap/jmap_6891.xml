Notes on ciliates (Protozoa, ciliophora) from Espeletia trees and Espeletia soils of the Andean PÃ¡ramo, with descriptions of sikorops espeletiae nov. spec. and Fragmocirrus espeletiae nov. gen., nov. spec.Ciliated protozoa from the giant rosettes of Espeletia trees (Compositae) and Espeletia soils were studied in four samples each from the Andean PÃramo in Venezuela and Ecuador. Collections were analysed with the non-flooded Petri dish method, which reactivates the ciliates' resting cysts from air-dried samples. Species were identified by live observation and silver impregnation. Although most samples, especially those from soil, contained many testate amoebae, only 18 ciliate species could be found, indicating that the non-flooded Petri dish method was rather ineffective. Probably, ciliates from this region do not make "strong " (drought resistant) resting cysts because of the humidity of the habitats. Most of the ciliate species recorded are common in litter and soil world-wide. However, two of them are new: Sikorops espeletiae nov. spec. and Fragmocirrus espeletiae nov. gen., nov. spec. Both species are described in detail, including ontogenesis of F. espeletiae. Two other as yet insufficiently known species are redescribed: Arcuospathidium muscorum (Dragesco & Dragesco-Kernâ€šis, 1979) and Gonostomum affine (Stein, 1859).
