Males of Timalinyssus wahlangi sp. n. differ from those of all Timalinyssus species by having the horseshoe-shaped epiandrum with a short anterior extension. Females of the new species differ from those of all previously known species of the genus in having the hysteronotal shield with deep lateral incisions between e2 and f2 setae. A key to all species of the genus Timalinyssus is presented.
