Ectosymbionts of the nonâ€indigenous Asian shore crab, Hemigrapsus sanguineus (Decapoda: Varunidae), in the western north Atlantic, and a search for its parasitesOver 560 Asian shore crabs, Hemigrapsus sanguineus, collected mainly in the spring of 2005 and 2006 from rocky intertidal locations in southern New Jersey, were examined for epibionts. Small numbers of the sympatric green crab, Carcinus maenas, and the Atlantic mud crab, Panopeus herbstii, were examined for epifauna to compare with H. sanguineus. Blue mussel spat, Mytilus edulis, and the encrusting, cheilostome bryozoan, Conopeum tenuissimum, were the dominant ectosymbionts of the shore crab, with prevalences of 22.2 and 32.1%, respectively; ranges of intensity were 1â€“146 spat/crab and 1â€“31 colonies/crab. Both species are incidental symbionts. Larger crabs had higher prevalences and intensities of C. tenuissimum colonies, and these colonies displayed a distinct pattern of attachment to the carapace which seemed to be related to crab morphology and habitat. Much less common was the encrusting, ctenostome bryozoan Alcyonidium albescens, a facultative symbiont species with a prevalence of 3.4%. Other epibionts were the encrusting, cheilostome Membranipora tenuis, the tubicolous polychaetes Hydroides dianthus, Sabellaria vulgaris, and Spirorbis sp., the barnacles Balanus improvisus and Semibalanus balanoides, and unidentified thecate hydroids, all incidental symbionts with prevalences from 0.2 to 3.2%. The total number of known ectosymbionts of H. sanguineus, including additional species found previously in the USA and the western Pacific, is 13. Carcinus maenas and P. herbstii share some of the same symbionts. Rhizocephalan externae were not observed in any of the crab species used in this study, nor were gill parasites or internal parasites found among 248 specimens of H. sanguineus.
