Posturas y estadio de eclosi√≥n del gastropodo muricidae Chorus giganteus (Lesson, 1829)Abstract According to ecological developmental patterns in muricids summarized by Spight (1977), Chorus gigahteus shows an intermediate Veliconcha hatching type. Egg size, hatching size and embryonic source of food are similar to those reported for Murex trapa; this last species also possesses a Veliconcha hatching type. Field observations reveal that Ch. giganteus inhabits on shallow water sand bottoms as predicted by Spight for muricid species with a Veliconcha hatching type. Egg mass structure of Ch. giganteus and field observations suggest a communal spawning as previously observed in other muricids. Some possible adaptations of Ch. giganteus in relation to its existence in sand bottoms are assumed and discussed. They specially refer to its hatching type and the availability of solid substrate for the attachment of egg capsules. According to information available for Chilean muricids, the developmental pattern of Ch. giganteus shows closer evolutionary affinities with that of Nucella crassilabrum than with that of Concholepas concholepas.
