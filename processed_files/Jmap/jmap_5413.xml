Interspecific differences in early lifeâ€history traits in crested newts (Triturus cristatus superspecies, Caudata, Salamandridae) from the Balkan PeninsulaWe studied intraspecific and interspecific variations of early lifeâ€history traits for four crested newt species with different habitat preferences. Although we found considerable variation in size and growth rate between offspring of conspecific females, the species effect appeared to be much more pronounced. The crested newt species we examined differed in egg size, size of larvae at hatching and growth rate. Triturus dobrogicus appeared to be the outlier species among these species, and showed (1) the smallest egg size, (2) the smallest larval size at hatching and (3) the longest larval period, resulting in the largest metamorphosed juveniles.
