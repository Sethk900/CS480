Silver Sagebrush Community Associations in Southeastern Alberta, Canada.Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) habitat in southeastern Alberta is limited by the distribution of silver sagebrush (Artemisia cana Pursh). We conducted a landscape assessment of silver sagebrush throughout the current range of sage-grouse in southeastern Alberta. Black-and-white aerial photography acquired in the fall of 2001 was used to map silver sagebrush. Contact print stereo pairs were interpreted using a stereoscope and initially classified into 1 of 13 site classes based on soil type and landscape feature (e.g., recent agriculture). Each site polygon was further broken down into smaller polygons based on the percentage of silver sagebrush occupancy, density distribution, and height. A total of 4626 site polygons were identified and classed into 1 of 13 site classes. To ensure all assumptions of statistical tests were met, the data set was reduced to 9 site classes. The mean percentage of silver sagebrush occupancy was significantly different between the 9 site classes (F=...
