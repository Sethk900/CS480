A new species of shrimp of the genus Anachlorocurtis Hayashi, 1975 from the Red Sea, with range extension of A. commensalis Hayashi, 1975 (Crustacea, Decapoda, Pandalidae)Abstract A new species of pandalid shrimp Anachlorocurtis occidentalis sp. n., associated with antipatharian corals, is described and illustrated from the north-eastern Red Sea. This new species is closely related to Anachlorocurtis commensalis Hayashi, 1975, the only other species in the genus, and can be distinguished by the more slender body and appendages; the carapace with 3 large, and one small, subtriangular lobes in the middorsal line; a flattened dorsal outline of the third abdominal segment; the sixth abdominal segment twice as long as fifth one; propodi of the ambulatory pereiopods bearing only a single posterior spinule; and harbouring 3–5 pairs of dorsolateral spines on the telson. A revised generic diagnosis is provided here to accommodate the present new species. The genetic divergence of mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) between Anachlorocurtis occidentalis sp. n., and A. commensalis is 15.2–15.4%. Molecular analysis also confirmed a sister position of the genus Anachlorocurtis to Miropandalus. The present records of A. commensalis from Taiwan constitute an extension of the known range of the species.
