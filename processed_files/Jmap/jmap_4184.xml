Passive trapping of aquatic caecilians (Amphibia: Gymnophiona: Typhlonectidae)Abstract Due to a paucity of quantitative methods to study caecilian amphibians, knowledge of their biology has lagged far behind that of other neotropical vertebrates. We report the passive trapping of the aquatic Typhlonectes compressicauda (Typhlonectidae) from a pond in French Guiana. Four collapsible, nylon-meshed funnel traps (two different manufacturers) were baited with fish and set over a total of five nights in June 2004 and January 2005. A total of 11 T. compressicauda were collected across four nights, all in the same single trap. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of passive trapping of aquatic caecilians. This method of capture provides study specimens, but also has the potential to yield quantitative data on the population biology of these poorly known amphibians.
