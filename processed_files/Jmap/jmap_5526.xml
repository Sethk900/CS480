Microhabitat use and feeding habits of Crossodactylus bokermanni Caramaschi and Sazima, 1985 (Anura, Hylodidae) at a site in south-eastern BrazilWe studied a population of Crossodactylus bokermanni in a stream at the Reserva Particular do Patrim√¥nio Natural, Santu√°rio do Cara√ßa, south‚Äeastern Brazil, with respect to microhabitat use and diet. We characterized microhabitats based on substrate, distance to water and exposure level of the occupying individual (exposed or sheltered), and adjacent aquatic microhabitats (evaluated as potential nesting sites based on observed nests), according to water current (absent, slow or fast), substrate and depth. Calling males, silent males, ovigerous females, non‚Äovigerous females and juveniles showed spatial niche overlap higher than that expected by chance, with calling males showing the strongest preference for microhabitats close to potential nesting sites (with intermediate depths, fast current and sandy bottom). Only 14 males out of 48 individuals examined for stomach contents had prey in their stomachs. The food items with the highest electivity values were Coleoptera and Diptera, but preys with both high and low mobility were exploited.
