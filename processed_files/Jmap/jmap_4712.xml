Estimation of water use by red grass (Themeda triandra Forssk.) growing in shallow soils: toward a method of on-farm drought assessmentThis study was prompted by the need of stock farmers without access to computers for a simple on-farm drought assessment method as an aid in management decision making with respect to stock numbers in times of drought. It is proposed that the drying process of a porous medium be calibrated for this purpose. During an observation period of two years, evaporation from potted plants was compared with that from pots containing bare soil only. A satisfactory correlation (r = 0.92 and 0.81, p < 0.0005) was found between evaporation data from the two sets of pots. The relationships that were found, showed promise for the application of the drought assessment method at farm level and beyond.
