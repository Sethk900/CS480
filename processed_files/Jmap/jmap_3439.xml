Mating performance of the Sage Grouse.Mating behavior of the Sage Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) was observed on April 5-8, 1940 near Skully Point, about 11 miles south of Kemmerer, Wyoming. A blind was found impractical but an automobile proved satisfactory for an observation point, not interfering with the activities of the birds. Car lights were off and men silent by 5 A.M. and, although before dawn, [male][male] were on the strutting ground in full progress with courtship display but [female][female] could not be observed until shortly after 5. About 300 cocks and 80 hens were present on the area, 200 yards wide and 1/4 mile long. Each cock stood 25-40 feet from his neighbor; sometimes they fought, mostly with wing-beating. Hens, in groups of 6 to 32, moved about the grounds and were kept grouped by 8-10 [male][male]. Most of the mating activity took place between 5 and 8 A.M. Strutting was confined to areas about 5 ft. in diam. The strut started with raising and spreading the wings, spreading the tail and raising the long black plumes on the back of the neck, followed by inflation of the large air sacs so that bare bulbs of yellowish breast skin showed. Then the birds walked forward, with head high, tossing the head and breast regions upward and forward 3 times, also mantling the head with white breast and neck feathers. Deflation of the air-sacs resulted in a bumping or plopping. Many photographs were presented showing these steps. Coition seemed to occur only on invitation from the [female]. It required 6-12 seconds. One [male] was observed to mate with 3 hens.
