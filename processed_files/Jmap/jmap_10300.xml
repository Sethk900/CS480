Association of seedcoat color with seed water uptake, germination, and seed components in guar (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taub)Seeds of guar black in color are believed to be of low quality. In the present experiment, seeds varying in color were studied to examine the effect of seedcoat color on water uptake, germination, and quantity of seed component. Results showed that the rate of water uptake for black-colored seeds was greater than that of dull-white-colored seeds. Black seeds had a higher germination than that of dull-white-colored seeds. Seedcoat quantity in black-colored seeds was less than dull-white seeds. Endosperm quantity and embryo quantity of black-colored seeds were not significantly different from those in dull-white-colored seeds. The higher water uptake rate and germination in black-colored seeds are likely due to the degeneration of seedcoat. This research suggests that guar seeds black in color may be recommended for planting or gum-extracting purposes with little expected loss in stand or gum yield.
