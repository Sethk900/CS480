A new neobisiid pseudoscorpion species from Crete (Greece), with notes on its morphology, distribution, evolution, and phylogenyThis study, based on an analysis of some palaeoâ€Mediterranean pseudoscorpions (Ernstmayria venizelosi n. sp. and E. apostolostrichasi Ä†urÄiÄ‡ and DimitrijeviÄ‡ from the family Neobisiidae) represents an outstanding improvement of our knowledge of the diversity of relict and distributionally limited false scorpions from the ancient (or protoâ€) Aegean area. Both E. venizelosi n. sp. and E. apostolostrichasi originated in the protoâ€Balkan region; their ancestors are to be sought among extinct forms. Since Ernstmayria species presently inhabit the â€˜peripheralâ€™ location of the ancient Aegeis, it is evident that their remote ancestor gave rise to a number of recent genera which presently constitute two generic groups inhabiting the Mediterranean region: Neobisium Chamberlin, Occitanobisium Heurtault, Roncobisium Vachon, Protoneobisium Ä†urÄiÄ‡, and Pennobisium Ä†urÄiÄ‡, on the one hand, and Acanthocreagris Mahnert, Balkanoroncus Ä†urÄiÄ‡, Insulocreagris Ä†urÄiÄ‡, and Roncocreagris Mahnert, on the other.
