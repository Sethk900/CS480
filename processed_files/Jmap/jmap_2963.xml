Seed predation by birds and small mammals in semiarid ChileWe studied spatial and temporal patterns in foraging activity among diurnal birds and nocturnal mammals at a semiarid site in northern Chile using artificial foraging trays. Small mammals foraged more extensively under shrubs than in open microhabitats, but birds showed no such selection. Moreover, avian foraging was more extensive than that by small mammals in all seasons and both microhabitats. Avian foraging was highly seasonal, as many birds at our site migrate to the Andean prepuna or to Patagonia during the austral summer. Birds have tended to be overshadowed by small mammals and ants in studies of granivory, but this study suggests that their importance may be underestimated in some systems.
