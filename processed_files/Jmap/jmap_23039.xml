A new genus and species of Tullbergiidae (Collembola) from the Pacific Mexican coastAbstract The new genus Mexicaphorura, and its type species Mexicaphorura guerrerensis sp. n. are described from marine littoral sand. The new genus is similar to Sensilatullbergia Thibaud & Ndiaye, 2006 in having very big sensilla on sensorial organ of antennal segment III, but of different shape, the kind of postantennal organ, with simple vesicles in Mexicaphorura versus composed vesicles in Sensilatullbergia and formulae of the pseudocelli.
