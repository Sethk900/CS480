Soil temperature, not aboveground plant productivity, best predicts intra-annual variations of soil respiration in central Iowa grasslandsSoil respiration (R-SOIL) is the second largest carbon flux between terrestrial systems and the atmosphere, with a magnitude 10 times greater than anthropogenic carbon dioxide production. Therefore, it is important that we understand, and be able to predict, how R-SOIL responds to climate change. Although a positive, significant temperature effect on R-SOIL has long been recognized, recent studies emphasize the overriding importance of current photosynthesis in controlling R-SOIL. We tested the hypothesis that model inclusion of intra-annual variations in aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) significantly improves R-SOIL estimates over predictions based on soil temperature alone. We also evaluated the possibility that canopy production is less directly linked to R-SOIL, by testing the hypothesis that intersite differences in R-SOIL correlate more strongly with root biomass than with ANPP. We tested these hypotheses by measuring R-SOIL, ANPP, and root biomass at four Iowa grasslands that differed in aboveground growth phenology and productivity. Among all sites, intra-annual variations in R-SOIL were most strongly related to soil temperature (R-2 = 0.89), not ANPP (R-2 = 0.53). All sites responded identically to changes in soil temperature (site-by-temperature P = 0.53), but inconsistently to variation in aboveground dynamics (site-by-canopy P < 0.0001). Incorporating canopy dynamics into temperature-based predictive models improved model R-2 by a maximum of 0.01. Among-site differences in R-SOIL were related to root biomass (P < 0.001) but not ANPP (P = 0.34). We found no useful linkage between canopy characteristics and intra-annual or site-specific R-SOIL predictions, perhaps because shoot and root dynamics were not consistently linked through time or among sites.
