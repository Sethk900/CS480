Short- and medium-term response of Atriplex halimus L. to repeated seasonal grazing in south-eastern Spain.Atriplex halimus L. is a valuable fodder shrub that has been widely used in arid Mediterranean regions. However, its response to several cumulative years of grazing management remains uncertain. Accordingly, we conducted a three-year experiment in south-eastern Spain to analyze the influence of repeated seasonal (winter-spring) sheep browsing on young A. halimus plants. Shrub growth, fodder and wood production, plant compactness and shoot moisture content were assessed through regular monitoring of the size of shrubs, sampling of summer shoots, and destructive procedures at the end of the experiment. Shrubs were on two closely located sites but where soil quality and water availability were different. At the better location, browsed shrubs grew less and were significantly smaller (P < 0.001) than the non-browsed saltbushes. In contrast, differences between groups were minimal where the growth conditions were poorer. In all cases, shrubs resprouted vigorously and maintained fodder production throughout the experiment. Browsing affected shrub structure, resulting in smaller but more compact plants (2.20 vs. 1.24 g dm-3, P < 0.001), but their proportion of fodder remained similar. The spring grazing increased shrub-shoot moisture content in the summer (62.5% vs. 56.0%, P < 0.001). Overall, this species responded very positively to repeated seasonal grazing.
