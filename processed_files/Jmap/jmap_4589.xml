Phytotoxicity resulting from pre-emergence graminicides in sorghumThis study was prompted by sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) producers reporting phytotoxicity when using graminicides under unfavourable environmental conditions. A greenhouse experiment was conducted in which five graminicides were evaluated at two temperature regimes, using 10 cultivars. Registered dosage rates of an acetochlo-atrazine-propazine mixture, an s-metolachlor-terbuthylazine mixture, an atrazine-s-metholachor mixture, s-metolachlor and alachlor, compared to an untreated control were applied. The cultivars PAN8816, PAN8813, PAN8806, PAN8706, PAN8618, PAN8564, PAN8446, PAN8212, NS5511 and NK283 were included in a completely randomised block with four replicates per treatment. Ten seeds per cultivar were planted in each pot, filled with soil with a 22% clay content. The trial was conducted at two temperature regimes of 20/25 °C. and 15/15° night/day for four days followed by a 20/25 °C night/day regime. Throughout the observation period, the only visual symptom of phytotoxicity that occurred was whiplashing of the leaves up to two weeks after graminicide application, after which the plants outgrew this symptom. Pronounced negative effects of alachlor, the s-metolachlor-terbuthylazine mixture and the atriazine-s-metolachlor mixture on PAN8212, atrazine-s-metolachlor mixture on PAN8816 and PAN 8806 as well as alachlor on PAN 8813 were recorded, contraindicating the combined use of these products on these cultivars. Graminicides were more hazardous under cold conditions as indicated by the number of emerged seedlings and whiplashing of the leaves. As field conditions are often not as favourable for plant development as in the greenhouse, these data need to be verified under field conditions.
