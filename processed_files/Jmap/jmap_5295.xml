Redescriptions of critical type species in the Eustylini Lacordaire (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Entiminae)Detailed morphological redescriptions and illustrations are provided for the following type species of six diverse and taxonomically overlapping genera of broad-nosed weevils, traditionally placed in or near the Neotropical tribe Eustylini Lacordaire (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Entiminae): Compsus argyreus (Linnaeus), Diaprepes abbreviatus (Linnaeus), Eustylus puber (Olivier), Exophthalmus quadrivittatus (Olivier), Exorides wagneri (von Harold), and Lachnopus valgus (Fabricius), which is apparently not a member of this tribe. Descriptions of mouthparts, male and female terminalia, and of other external and internal structures are reported for the first time, and thus build a foundation for re-examining the taxonomic limits and phylogenetic relationships among eustyline genera. It is suggested that the type specimen of D. abbreviatus, originally described by Linnaeus, pertains to populations that occur along the northern coast of Puerto Rico.
