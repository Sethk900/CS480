Growth and nitrogen fixation of legumes at increased salinity under field conditions: implications for the use of green manures in saline environmentsIn this paper we identify yellow sweet clover (Melilotus officinalis) as a suitable candidate to be adopted as a green manure in saline agriculture. The plants perform well up to a third seawater salinity concentration and continue to get their nitrogen from symbiotic root bacteria. Alternatively, alfalfa (Medicago sativa) could be used since it shows similar tolerance to salinity. However, since the absolute biomass of yellow sweet clover is considerably higher, this plant would be our choice if the goal is to enrich soils with organic material and, specifically, with a sustainable input of nitrogen. The use of legumes as green manure can potentially increase crop productivity in saline environments and thus contribute to the sustainability of agricultural systems. Here, we present results from a field experiment conducted in the Netherlands that addressed the efficiency of nitrogen (N) fixation by a legume at varying salinities. We grew Melilotus officinalis in an agricultural field using drip irrigation with water salinity varying in electrical conductivity between 1.7 and 20 dS m−1. In the experiment, nearly 100 % of total plant N in M. officinalis was derived from symbiotic fixation at all but the highest salinity level (20 dS m−1). Our results indicated that this species derived substantial amounts of N via symbiotic fixation, the N becoming available in the soil (and thus available to crops) when cultivated legumes senesce and decompose. Based on the growth performance of M. officinalis and its ability to fix N at moderate soil salinity in our field experiments, we identified this species as a promising source for green manure in saline agriculture in temperate regions.
