Climatic controls on the carbon and water balances of a boreal aspen forest, 1994-2003.The carbon and water budgets of boreal and temperate broadleaf forests are sensitive to interannual climatic variability and are likely to respond to climate change. This study analyses 9 years of eddy-covariance data from the Boreal Ecosystem Research and Monitoring Sites (BERMS) Southern Old Aspen site in central Saskatchewan, Canada and characterizes the primary climatic controls on evapotranspiration, net ecosystem production (<em>F</em><sub>NEP</sub>), gross ecosystem photosynthesis (<em>P</em>) and ecosystem respiration (<em>R</em>). The study period was dominated by two climatic extremes: extreme warm and cool springs, which produced marked contrasts in the canopy duration, and a severe, 3-year drought.
