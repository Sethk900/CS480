Damage and shade enhance climbing and promote associational resistance in a climbing plant.<ol><li>Associational resistance occurs when one plant species gains protection from its consumers by association with a defended species. In semi-arid ecosystems of Chile, the perennial herb <em>Convolvulus chilensis</em> (Convolvulaceae) suffers heavy herbivory by small mammals when growing prostrate but plants seem to be protected when they are climbing onto cacti or thorny shrubs (nurse species).</li><li>Field observations suggest that damaged main stems have a greater number of small lateral stems, which greatly enhance climbing success. In this field study we addressed whether <em>C. chilensis</em> shows associational resistance by climbing onto nurse species, and evaluated whether damage and also shade (a cue for neighbour presence) elicit architectural responses that enhance climbing probability.</li><li>We documented associational resistance for <em>C. chilensis</em>: climbing individuals growing associated with cacti and thorny shrubs suffered less herbivory (percentage of damaged stems: 35 vs. 98) and had greater reproductive output (number of reproductive structures at the end of the season: 150 vs. 0) than prostrate individuals growing in isolation. Experimental clipping of the main stem caused plants to produce a greater number of lateral stems both in sun (70% increase) and in shade (66% increase) treatments. Moreover, stem damage caused a 50% increase in the number of stems actually climbing on a support, but only in shade.</li><li><em>Synthesis</em>. We show for the first time that phenotypic responses to herbivory of the potentially protected species may enhance association with the defended nurse species, thereby promoting associational resistance. This finding adds a new perspective for mechanistic studies of positive interactions among plants, suggesting that behavioural responses of the protégée may mediate the magnitude of nurse effects.</li></ol>
