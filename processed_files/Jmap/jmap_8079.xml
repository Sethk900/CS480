Patterns in the local assembly of Egyptian rodent faunas: Co-occurrence and nestednessWe studied co-occurrence patterns of 29 rodents across 308 sites in Egypt to evaluate spatial variation and non-randomness in community assembly (co-occurrence and nestedness). There was strong evidence for negative species association in the entire fauna. Negative associations can be traced to habitat segregation among species, the discreteness of habitats, low species richness at local assemblages due to aridity and low primary productivity, and allopatry of sibling species. Nevertheless, high degree of nestedness characterizes the entire collection, as tested by BINMATNEST and Aninhado. Species ranks in the packed matrix were significantly correlated with incidence, total abundance, number of coexisting species, total number of species combinations, and range size. Analyses of the assemblages by region and sampling intensity using Aninhado simulations confirmed the nestedness for the whole fauna and showed little or no nested structure in species incidences.Egyptian rodent faunas appear to be structured by a dynamic interplay of biotic and abiotic factors operating on distinct sets of species with shared habitat preferences and requirements. Local assembly patterns may result from interspecific interactions coupled with aridity and low productivity, habitat requirements, and historical factors. The harsh conditions of these arid regions led to the prevalence of species exclusion.Research highlights► Egyptian rodents exhibited evidence for negative co-occurrence and significant nestedness. ► Negative associations are due to habitat segregation, low species richness due to aridity and low primary productivity, and allopatry of sibling species. ► Local assembly of Egyptian rodents is due to interspecific interactions coupled with low productivity, habitat requirements, and historical factors.
