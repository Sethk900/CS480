Revegetation of Pb/Zn Mine Tailings, Guangdong Province, China.The Lechang lead/zinc mine is located in the north part of Guangdong Province, southern China. The tailings residue from the extraction of lead/zinc ores was permanently stored in tailings ponds, which required revegetation to reduce the environmental impact. A field study was, therefore, conducted to evaluate the effects of different ameliorants, including: (1) pig manure (PM); (2) mushroom compost (MC); (3) burnt coal residue (BC); (4) fly ash (FA); and (5) surface soil on the growth of <em>Agropyron elongatum</em> (tall wheat grass), <em>Cynodon dactylon</em> (Bermuda grass), <em>Lolium multiflorum</em> (Italian ryegrass), <em>and Trifolium repens</em> (clover) in the tailings residue. The results from the core profiles indicated that adding FA (10 cm) or BC (15 cm) as a barrier layer between the cover soil and the tailings could increase pH, compared to the treatment with soil only. <em>C. dactylon</em> grew well and had a high cover (90-100%) in all the treatment plots except the control plots without any amendment. <em>A. elongatum</em> and <em>L. multiflorum</em> had a higher cover when grown in plots covered with a barrier layer using FA or BC (both with surface soil), than those grown in plots covered with surface soil only. Treatment plots receiving a thicker soil cover (30 cm) had a better dry weight yield than those with a thinner soil cover (15 cm), regardless of the barrier layer. The results from this study indicate that the use of either 15 cm BC or 10 cm FA as a barrier layer with surface soil, or the use of 38 tonnes PM/ha and 6 cm MC, were effective for the revegetation of Pb/Zn mine tailings. <em>C. dactylon</em> was the best species among the four species used for revegetation.
