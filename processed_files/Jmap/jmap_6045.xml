Resistance in new groundnut breeding lines to black pod rot caused by Chalara elegansBlack pod rot or black hull of groundnut caused by the fungus Chalara elegans results in severe damage to groundnut pods and kernels in South Africa. The disease is managed most effectively by planting resistant varieties. The commercial varieties currently available, however, are no longer resistant. New varieties have been identified which show improved disease resistance. The most suitable varieties for commercial production are PC 253-K2 and PC 253-K6, which are selections of the Spanish type most adapted to South African conditions.
