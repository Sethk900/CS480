Cileoporus, a new genus of Rove Beetles from central and South America (Coleoptera, Staphylinidae, Tachyporinae)This paper describes the new genus Cileoporus to include the species Cilea fenestrata Sharp and Tachinus politus Bernhauer. Tachinus politus Bernhauer is designated as the type species. Cileoporus is assigned to the Tribe Tachyporini of the family Staphylinidae. All major characters of the genus are illustrated with line drawings or scanning electron photomicrographs and a key is provided to distinguish the new genus from all other genera of the tribe known to occur in Central and South America. Brief diagnostic descriptions and a key is provided to aid in distinguishing the two species of the genus. The characters most useful for distinguishing the species are illustrated. A lectotype is designated for Tachinus politus Bernhauer.
