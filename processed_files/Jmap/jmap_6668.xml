Preliminary evaluation of two maize (Zea mays L.) growth-simulation modelsTwo maize growth-simulation models developed in the U.S.A., CERES-Malze and CORNF, were evaluated with South African data using graphical and numerical techniques. The results indicate that both models agree well with observed values of total above-ground plant dry mass, leaf area index, grain yield and soil water content. CORNF tended towards a systematic underprediction of leaf area index. CERES-Maize provided more realistic estimates of soil water content than CORNF. The future use of these models in the evaluation of cropping strategies is discussed.
