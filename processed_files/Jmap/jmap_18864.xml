Soil respiration from four aggrading forested watersheds measured over a quarter centurySoil respiration was measured in four aggrading, forested second-growth watersheds in the southern Appalachians using an identical method (alkali absorption) at intervals 23 and 24 years apart. Seasonal trends were similar, with mid-summer maxima and winter minima. Amounts of carbon dioxide evolved were higher in the recent measurements (1995) compared to the earlier ones (1971-1972), despite similar soil water and temperature regimes. The overall trend across all four watersheds may reflect changes in organic matter levels and subsequent root growth, (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
