The Relevance of Owen Lattimore's Writings for Nomadic Pastoralism Research and Development in Inner AsiaNomadic pastoral systems in Inner Asia are facing sweeping changes. Designing new development models for the sustainable utilization of rangelands requires a better understanding of nomadic pastoral systems. Owen Lattimore’s writings, based on his experiences in Inner Asia in the 1920s and 1930s, are a valuable resource for those interested in nomads and pastoral development in Inner Asia. The paper introduces some of Lattimore’s work to illustrate their relevance to today’s pastoral development challenges. Despite being written 70 years ago, Lattimore’s texts are still useful for understanding traditional livestock management practices and provide valuable insight for the sustainable development of the pastoral areas of Inner Asia.
