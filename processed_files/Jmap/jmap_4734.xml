User-friendly model for chemical equilibrium of CaSO4 solutionsUser-friendly Windows software (ChemEq) was developed for calculation of solution chemical equilibrium and precipitation- dissolution of lime and gypsum. ChemEq calculates ionic concentrations and activities, pH, solid phase gypsum and lime, sodium adsorption ratio and electrical conductivity from initial concentrations of ions, gypsum and lime. The program is written in Delphi v. 5.0 and is available for use with Windows 98/ME/2000 and NT on an IBM-PC or compatible computer. The main applications are in the calculation of chemical equilibrium of CaSO4 solutions.
