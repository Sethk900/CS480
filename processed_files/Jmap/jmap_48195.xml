Rehabilitation of Vegetation Mapping of ATB Opencast Coal-Mine Based on GIS and RSOpencast coal mining has a large impact on the surrounding landscape. Original ecosystems are disturbed, and the restoration of vegetation is necessary. How to obtain effectively vegetation growth effectively under coal exploitation stress is always a detection problem in monitoring a mining environment. ATB open mine began mining at 1987 with a 92-year production life, and the mining area is about 60 square kilometers, which has 5 dumps at present. The reclamation projection has been more than 20 years since 1988, and the reclamation work takes every 2 or 3 years with the reshaping and rehabilitation of dumps. In 2005, two dumps (south dump and west dump) have been reclaimed completely. The paper is aimed to monitor vegetation species on reclaimed dumps using Quickbird remote sensing image of 2006 in order to evaluate a long-term land reclamation strategy and impact. The vegetation on reclaimed dumps is mapped based on the high resolution image, DEM data and field survey. This study focuses on feasible conditions of vegetation through analyzing the vegetation landscape and succession, and then reveals vegetation types which are suitable for mining conditions. There are 24 types of vegetation at reclaimed ATB open mine dumps The locust and Hippophae rhamnoides as pioneer plant plays a key role in the mining ecological restoration, and Shrub on the bank can prevent from water loss and soil erosion effectively. The revegetation spatial and temporal variabilities could help the species chosen in the next land reclamation plan.
