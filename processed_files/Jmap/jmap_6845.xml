A New Species of Minute Hyla from the Southwestern Amazon Basin (Amphibia, Anura, Hylidae)Hyla joannae spec. nov., a new small species of hylid frog, is described from Cobija, Departamento Pando, northern Bolivia. The new species is most similar to Hyla leali from which it differs mainly by smaller size, shorter snout, more protuberant eyes, more tuberculate dorsal skin, and a red inner iris in life. Morphological characters and advertisement call of Hyla joannae spec. nov. suggest it being related to the Hyla microcephala group. Differences in recordings of Hyla leali calls are discussed and compared to calls of the new species.
