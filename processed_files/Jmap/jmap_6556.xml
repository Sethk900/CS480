Drought sensitivity of maize (Zea mays L.) in relation to soil fertility and water stress during different growth stagesMaize was grown under controlled conditions in a pot experiment to determine how drought sensitivity would be affected by differential soil fertilities. Soil was obtained from a fertilization field trial where soil fertility differences developed over a period of 45 years. Four water stress treatments were applied in the pot experiment. Grain yield was determined as a measure of the stress reaction. Plants with nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium deficiencies were apparently less tolerant to water stress conditions than well fertilized plants. As could be expected, plants were more sensitive to drought during the reproductive phase than during the vegetative phase. However, the differences in sensitivity were much more for plants with nutrient deficiencies. The results implied that nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium played a beneficial role in the drought adaptation mechanisms of the well fertilized plants.
