Novel Approach to Detecting Pipe Bursts in Water Distribution NetworksAbstractThis paper presents a data-driven simulation-based burst detection approach in water distribution systems using control limit analysis. System specific burst sensitivity tables are developed by synthetically generating burst events and analyzing the system hydraulic responses to the given bursts. Potential locations of pressure and flow meters are suggested based on the sensitivity tables. By matching the field observation data with the developed burst sensitivity tables, potential burst hotspots are identified. Using simulated bursts for a simple literature network, it was found that the proposed approach is effective to quickly locate bursts and reduce response times.
