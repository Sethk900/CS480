 Molecular phylogenetic analysis of three groups of Asian epilachnine ladybird beetles recognized by the female internal reproductive organs and modes of sperm transferWe determined partial sequences of the nuclear 28S ribosomal RNA gene (717 base pairs) and mitochondrial DNA NADH-dehydrogenase subunit 2 gene (535 base pairs) of 25 species of phytophagous ladybird beetles from Asia that comprise 16 species of the genus Henosepilachna and nine species of the genus Epilachna, and reconstructed the phylogenetic trees for each gene by the maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods. The estimated phylogenetic relationships were consistent with those obtained by the mode of sperm transfer and female internal reproductive system, and supported an earlier assumption that very similar elytral spot patterns of some sympatric members of epilachnine beetles evolved independently.
