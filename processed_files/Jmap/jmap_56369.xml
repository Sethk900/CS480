Characteristics of micromorphology and element distribution of iron–manganese cutans in typical soils of subtropical ChinaThe goal of this study was to investigate the characteristics of iron–manganese cutans and to observe information of their pedogenic processes and certain environmental condition changes in the pedogenic process of subtropical Chinese soils. The characteristics of micromorphology of iron–manganese cutans and element distribution with linear microprofiles (i.e., the vertical microprofile from cutan to matrix soil) in Fragiudalfs (FRA), Ferrudalfs (FER) and Hapludult (HAP). Cutans and matrix soils were studied by chemical analyses, optical microscopy (OM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The micromorphological structure of iron–manganese cutan was a thin black film with alternating color of red and brown, and about 1 mm thick of soil particles. The structures of cutan materials were denser, and the boundaries between cutans and matrix soils were clear. EDS analyses of cutans and the plasma phase of the matrix soils, showed that the contents of MnO2, Fe2O3 and CaO in cutans were higher than those in matrix soils, while the content of SiO2 showed the opposite trend. From the outer to inner, cutans in Fragiudalfs and Ferrudalfs can be easily fractionated into manganese-rich, iron–manganese-rich and iron-rich regions. But there were only iron–manganese-rich and iron-rich regions in cutans in Hapludult, there was no clear manganese-rich region of belt structure in it. These differences were attributed to soil-forming factors. The formation of belt structure in iron–manganese cutans would probably undergo several great change in landscapes and soil environments. It indicated that the growth of cutans was in environments of alternating wetting and drying. They gradually grew in the oxidation–reduction process on the dry or wet condition of whole bulk soils.
