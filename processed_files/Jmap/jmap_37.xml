Enhancing buffel grass seed germination by acid treatment for rapid vegetation establishment on railway batters.Buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) is one of the preferred species for revegetation of railway embankment steep slopes (batters) in Central Queensland, Australia. Its seed germination is inherently poor and becomes unpredictable, especially in semi-arid regions characterized by low rainfall, due to its extended period of dormancy. Thus its use for railway batters erosion control becomes a major concern where the development of good grass cover within a short time is required to minimize the risk of damage from storms. The effects of different germination media, and concentrations and soaking duration of sulphuric acid (H2SO4) on seed germination were evaluated.
