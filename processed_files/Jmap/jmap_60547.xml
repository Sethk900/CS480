Inversion of a forest reflectance model to estimate structural canopy variables from hyperspectral remote sensing dataThe potential of canopy reflectance modelling to retrieve simultaneously several structural variables in managed Norway spruce stands was investigated using the Ã¢Â€ÂœInvertible Forest Reflectance ModelÃ¢Â€Â, INFORM. INFORM is an innovative extension of the FLIM model, with crown transparency, infinite crown reflectance and understory reflectance simulated using physically based sub-models (SAILH, LIBERTY and PROSPECT). The INFORM model was inverted with hyperspectral airborne HyMap data using a neural network approach. INFORM based estimates of forest structural variables were produced using site-specific ranges of stand structural variables. A relatively simple three layer feed-forward backpropagation neural network with two input neurons, one neuron in the hidden layer and three output neurons was employed to map leaf area index (LAI), crown coverage and stem density.To identify the optimum 2-band spectral subset to be used in the inversion process, all 2-band combinations of the HyMap dataset were systematically evaluated for model inversion. Field measurements of structural variables from 39 forest stands were used to validate the maps produced from HyMap imagery. Using two HyMap wavebands at 837 nm and 1148 nm the obtained accuracy of the LAI map amounts to an rmse of 0.58 (relative rmse=18% of mean, R2=0.73). With HyMap data resampled to Landsat TM spectral bands and using two Ã¢Â€ÂœoptimumÃ¢Â€Â bands at 840 nm and 1650 nm, rmse was 0.66 and relative rmse 21%. In contrast to approaches based on empirical relations between spectral vegetation indices and structural variables, the main advantage of the inversion approach is that it does not require previous calibration.
