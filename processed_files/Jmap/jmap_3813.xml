               Interaction between the cactus               Neobuxbaumia tetetzo               and the nurse shrub               Mimosa luisana             (1) Analysis of the relationships and performance of Larrea tridentata and Opuntia leptocaulis in the Big Bend National Park, Texas (Chihuahuan Desert), indicated that the former serves as a site for establishment of the latter and is eventually replaced by it. (2) Burrowing rodents and soil erosion damage the shallow roots of 0. leptocaulis and, presumably, increase the mortality rate, while having little effect on Larrea tridentata. This leaves openings which are colonized by the prolific L. tridentata
