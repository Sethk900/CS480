Accelerated soil formation due to paddy management on marshlands (Zhejiang Province, China)Inundation of paddy soils for submerged rice production strongly impacts soil formation. Here we used chronosequences with up to 2000 years of cultivation history to compare soil formation in non-inundated (non-paddy) cropping systems with the formation of soils used for paddy rice production. This approach allowed us to identify the influence of agricultural management at different stages of pedogenesis.  Soil samples were taken from two chronosequences derived from uniform parent material in the coastal region of the Zhejiang Province (P.R. China). One chronosequence consisted of paddy soils of different ages (50–2000 years), characterized by a yearly cropping sequence of rice cultivation under flooded conditions alternated with a non-inundated crop. The adjacent non-inundated (non-paddy) chronosequence was exclusively used for non-inundated crop production for 50–700 years. Lipid biomarkers revealed origin and homogeneity of the original coastal sediments and enabled the reconstruction of a consistent land use history for both chronosequences.
