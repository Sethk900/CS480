Industrial Structure Optimization based on Water Quantity and Quality RestrictionsAbstractThis paper studied industrial structure improvement to regulate the relation between economic development and available water resources and control water pollutant from the industries. First, the paper analyzes the relationship of industrial improvement with water resources utilization by use of statistical method and points out that the primary and the secondary industry rely on water resources more closely than the tertiary industry. Second, the paper establishes optimal models to improve three industrial structures in which the target functions are restricted to the water pollutant holding capacity, the development planning of the regional economy, and the available water resources. Finally, the paper applies the models on Yingtan, a medium-sized city in China. By using the optimal model, the developing rate of some secondary and tertiary industry sectors that have good water saving and less pollutants are improved, while the developing speed of high water consumption sectors dropped. Through the optimization, water demand in 2020 and 2030 increases a little although its economy grows a lot, and COD and NH3-N discharged to the rivers in Guixi, Yujiang, and Yuehu, China, are all controlled within the water pollutant holding capacity in 2020 and 2030. The improvement of industry structure is a valid method to reduce water consumption and water pollutant.
