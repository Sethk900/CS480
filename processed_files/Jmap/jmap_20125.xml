Evaluation of fungal spore characteristics in Beijing, China, based on molecular tracer measurementsPM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters less than 2.5 μm) and PM10 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters less than 10 μm) samples were collected by high-volume air samplers simultaneously at a rural site and an urban site in Beijing, China. Various carbohydrates were quantified by high-performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD), including the sugar alcohols mannitol and arabitol, recently proposed as molecular tracers for fungal aerosol. The annual average concentrations of arabitol in PM2.5 and PM10 at the urban site were 7.4 ± 9.4 and 21.0 ± 20.4 ng m−3, and the respective mannitol concentrations were 10.3 ± 9.5 and 31.9 ± 26.9 ng m−3. During summer and autumn, higher arabitol and mannitol levels than during spring and winter were observed in coarse particles, probably due to different dominant sources of fungal spores in different seasons. In the dry season (i.e., winter and spring) in Beijing, probably only the suspension from exposed surfaces (e.g., soil resuspension, transported dust, etc) can be regarded as the main sources for fungal aerosols. On the other hand, in summer and autumn, fungal spores in the atmosphere can be derived from more complex sources, including plants, vegetation decomposition and agricultural activity, such as ploughing; these fungal spore sources may contribute more to coarse PM. Moreover, statistical analysis according to typical seasonal patterns, including a dry season (December 2010 to March 2011) and a wet season (July to September 2011), revealed different variations of fungal spores in different seasons. Although fungal spore levels at rural sites were reported to be consistently higher than those at urban sites in other studies, our findings showed the opposite pattern, indicating a high abundance of fungal spores in the urban area of this Chinese megacity.
