A new species of Amphictene (Annelida, Pectinariidae) from the northern South China SeaPectinariids are a family of polychaetes commonly found in shallow coastal waters around the world, but their diversity is poorly known along the coasts of Asia. Here we describe Amphictene alata sp. n. (Pectinariidae), based on 15 specimens collected from the coastal waters of Guangdong in the northern South China Sea. This new species can be distinguished from all other 13 described species and one described subspecies of Amphictene by having a pair of dorsolateral lobes on segment 3, a pair of large lateral lobes on segment 21, and more scaphal hooks (26 to 37 pairs).
