Effect of timing and method of nitrogen application on rind colour, fruit size, internal fruit quality and yield of ‘Mihowase Satsuma’ mandarin (Citrus unshiu Marc.)Early rind colour development is a major problem in the production of early-maturing ‘Mihowase Satsuma’ mandarin (Citrus unshiu Marc.) in the Western Cape, South Africa. The effect of different combinations of soil- applied limestone ammonium nitrate and foliar-applied low-biuret urea on rind colour, fruit size, internal fruit quality and yield of ‘Mihowase Satsuma’ mandarin on ‘Troyer’ citrange [C. sinensis (L.) Osbeck × Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.] rootstock was evaluated. This study was carried out over four consecutive seasons in Stellenbosch, South Africa (33°56'S, 18°51'E; 119 m.a.s.l.; Mediterranean-type climate). Despite a wide range in annual N application rate from 88 to 180 kg N-ha-1 p.a., leaf N concentration never exceeded 2.2%, with no consistent differences in leaf N levels, rind colour, fruit size, internal fruit quality and yield among treatments. The current leaf N norms for ‘Satsuma’ mandarin may be too high, and an optimal leaf N content of 1.9 to 2.1% is suggested.
