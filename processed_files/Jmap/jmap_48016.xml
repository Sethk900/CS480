Physical structure of an ant community in semi-arid AustraliaA study was carried out on the physical structure of an ant community in a semi-arid habitat of southern New South Wales. Thirty seven species were collected from the area, and the relative abundance and spatial distribution of colonies of these species were determined in two plots, one in an area dominated by saltbush (Atriplex vesicaria), the other in an area where saltbush had been removed by overgrazing, leaving a simple grassland. The composition and community structure of the populations were found to be little affected by vegetation, and there were no marked differences between the ant faunas of the two areas. Analyses of spatial distribution of the ant colonies showed a variety of patterns, ranging from aggregated to over dispersed, both within and between species. It is suggested that the contemporary structure of an ant community results in the main from processes involving aggressive interactions, determined by the intrinsic properties of the constituent species.
