The taxonomic status and phylogenetic relationships of the genus Aenigmomphiscola Kruglov and Starobogatov, 1981 (Gastropoda: Pulmonata: Lymnaeidae)The taxonomic status and phylogenetic relationships of the lymnaeid genus Aenigmomphiscola Kruglov and Starobogatov, 1981 are studied for the first time using molecular taxonomic methods. Snails of this genus have strong conchological similarity to representatives of the genus Omphiscola Rafinesque, 1815, but differ from other lymnaeids by an advanced inner structure of the praeputium. In spite of clear morphological differences between Aenigmomphiscola and Omphiscola, some authors have proposed their probable synonymy. The use of four molecular markers (two nuclear and two mitochondrial) and two phylogenetic tree-building algorithms allowed us to conclude that Aenigmomphiscola is an independent genus within Lymnaeidae that is closely allied to Omphiscola. These genera are vicarious, as the first of them inhabits the eastern, and the second the western part of the Palaearctic. Conchological and radular characters are not sufficient to distinguish between Aenigmomphiscola and Omphiscola.
