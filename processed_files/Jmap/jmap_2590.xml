VARIATION IN HERBIVORE-MEDIATED INDIRECT EFFECTS OF AN INVASIVE PLANT ON A NATIVE PLANT.Theory predicts that damage by a shared herbivore to a secondary host plant species may either be higher or lower in the vicinity of a preferred host plant species. To evaluate the importance of ecological factors, such as host plant proximity and density, in determining the direction and strength of such herbivore-mediated indirect effects, we quantified oviposition by the exotic weevil <em>Rhinocyllus conicus</em> on the native wavyleaf thistle <em>Cirsium undulatum</em> in midgrass prairie on loam soils in the upper Great Plains, USA. Over three years (2001–2003), the number of eggs laid by <em>R. conicus</em> on <em>C. undulatum</em> always decreased significantly with distance (0–220 m) from a musk thistle (<em>Carduus nutans</em> L.) patch. Neither the level of <em>R. conicus</em> oviposition on <em>C. undulatum</em> nor the strength of the distance effect was predicted by local musk thistle patch density or by local <em>C. undulatum</em> density (≤5 m). The results suggest that high <em>R. conicus</em> egg loads on <em>C. undulatum</em> near musk thistle resulted from the native thistle's co-occurrence with the coevolved preferred exotic host plant and not from the weevil's response to local host plant density. Mean egg loads on <em>C. undulatum</em> also were greater at sites with higher <em>R. conicus</em> densities. We conclude that both preferred-plant proximity and shared herbivore density strongly affected the herbivore-mediated indirect interaction, suggesting that such interactions are important pathways by which invasive exotic weeds can indirectly impact native plants.
