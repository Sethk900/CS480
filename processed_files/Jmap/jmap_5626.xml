New and littleâ€known earthworm species from the Ivory Coast (Oligochaeta: Acanthodrilidae: Benhamiinae and Eudrilidae)In the framework of the international project called â€œConservation and Sustainable Management of Belowâ€Ground Biodiversityâ€, soil macrofauna collections were carried out in the Centreâ€West Ivory Coast. Altogether, 13 earthworm species were recorded, of which four belonged to the family Eudrilidae and nine to the family Acanthodrilidae. From the species collected, two, Dichogaster (Dichogaster) eburnea sp. nov. and Dichogaster (Dichogaster) mamillata sp. nov., proved to be new to science. To accommodate the enigmatic eudrilid earthworm species Scolecillus compositus Omodeo, 1958, a new genus, Lavellea gen. nov., is proposed.
