Phytoseiidae from date palms in Israel with descriptions of two new taxa and a key to the species found on date palms worldwide (Acari: Mesostigmata)The old world date mite Oligonychus afrasiaticus (McGregor) is an important spider mite pest of the date palms Phoenix dactylifera in most of North Africa and the Middle East. To identify potential predators of this key pest we monitored the phytoseiids in the date palm canopy and on the orchard floor for three consecutive years in the Southern Arava Valley of Israel. In this study we report on the phytoseiid species found. We describe two new species, Neoseiulus cozae and Typhlodromus shoshae, and redescribe seven species, Proprioseiopsis beatus, Neoseiulus marginatus, N. conterminus, N. rambami, N. bicaudus, Cydnoseius negevi and Typhlodromus athiasae, found on date palms or on the understorey Bermuda grass, Cynodon dactylon, gramineae in these orchards. A key to all species collected from date palm orchards worldwide is given. Proprioseiopsis beatus, N. marginatus and N. conterminus are recorded for the first time in Israel.
