Flower Visits of Centris Bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae) in an Area of Caatinga (Bahia, Brazil)Periodic sampling of bees visiting flowering plants resulted in the collection of 91 individuals of 10 Centris species in an area of Caatinga (Itatim, Bahia, Brazil). These bees visited 12 species of plants. Melochia tomentosa (Sterculiaceae), a nectar source, was the most frequently visited plant. Chamaecrista, Senna and Solanum species were visited for pollen, and Stigmaphyllon auriculatum for oil. Centris bees were captured from September through April. The data suggest a seasonal pattern of activity, associated with the rainy season.
