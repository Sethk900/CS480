This communication gives information about the first reports from Poland, summarises the speciesâ€™ conquest of Europe and gives forecasts and possible explanations for such a rapid expansion. An identification key to aphid species on Abies is provided to help monitor its further expansion, as well as for the benefit of forestry and phytosanitary services.
