Description and notes on the bionomics of a new species of Potamophilops Grouvelle, 1896 (Coleoptera: Elmidae: Larainae), from the Cerrado biome in BrazilPotamophilops bragaorum sp. nov. is described and illustrated based on adult specimens collected in a mountainous area in the Cerrado biome in Taquaruçú district, Tocantins state, Brazil. This is the second species described in the genus and it represents the northernmost record of Potamophilops, which is known only from Argentina and Brazil. In this article we provide a diagnosis, details on the morphology and images of the habitus and structures used to determine the species and to distinguish the gender. Field observations permitted the description of some aspects on the biology of the new species that seem to be very similar to those of other Larainae genera. Examination of gut contents revealed a diet based mostly on periphyton.
