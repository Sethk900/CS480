Degradation of 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid in an Internal Circulation Three-Phase Fluidized Photoreactor Using N-TiO2/γ-Al2O3 Granule as Adsorbent and PhotocatalystAbstractThe herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) was degraded in an internal circulation three-phase fluidized photoreactor (ICFPR) using nitrogen doping TiO2 and γ-Al2O3 composite oxide granules (N-TiO2/γ-Al2O3) as an adsorbent and photocatalyst. Granules of N-TiO2/γ-Al2O3 were prepared by a coprecipitation/oil-drop/calcination process using titanium sulfate and aluminum sulfate as raw materials and eiderdown was used as nitrogen doped and holes formed substance. The effects of the initial concentration and solution pH on the adsorption capacity of the granules for 2,4-D were investigated. The physiochemical performance and photocatalytic activity of 2,4-D degradation of the granules were studied. The results of this research indicated that the composite granules had anatase TiO2 and γ-Al2O3 phases with granularity of 0.5–1.0 mm and could be used as an adsorbent and photocatalyst in an ICFPR reactor. The granules had excellent adsorption performance as the amount of adsorption for 2,4-D could be up to 120-mg/g granules and demonstrated high attrition resistance with only 0.03∼0.04% of mass released from the granules after 5 h of continuous operation. The granules showed a higher visible light (400∼500  nm) photocatalytic activity for 2,4-D. The percentage of degradation could reach up to 95% under 60-W fluorescent light irradiation for 5 h. It might result from the generation of an additional band of N2p in the forbidden band of TiO2 molecular, the synergetic effect of nitrogen, and high adsorption properties of Al2O3. After having been used nine times, the photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared N-TiO2/γ-Al2O3 granules remained nearly unchanged. Possible mechanisms of 2,4-D photocatalytic degradation are discussed.
