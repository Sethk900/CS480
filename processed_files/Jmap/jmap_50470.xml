Nitrate uptake and storage in the seaweed Ulva rigida C. Agardh in relation to nitrate availability and thallus nitrate content in a eutrophic coastal lagoon (Sacca di Goro, Po River Delta, Italy)The seasonal cycle of biomass and tissue composition of Ulva rigida C. Agardh, in relation to nitrogen availability in the water column, was studied in 1991–1992 in the Sacca di Goro, a highly eutrophic lagoon in the Po River Delta (Italy). Nitrate uptake rates and storage capacity were also determined in laboratory experiments. The seasonal growth of U. rigida was related to the seasonal trend of nitrogen concentration in the water column. U. rigida biomass increased exponentially during spring and attained peaks of about 300–400 g dry mass (DM) m−2 in June. As biomass increased, U. rigida depleted nitrate in the water column. Thallus nitrate reserves also declined from 100 μmol N (g DM)−1 to almost undetectable levels, and total thallus nitrogen declined from 4% to 2.5% DM and 1.25% DM in 1991 and 1992, respectively. During summer, U. rigida decomposition increased, and organic nitrogen concentrations in the water column increased. The uptake experiments demonstrated an inverse relationship between thallus nitrate content and nitrate uptake rates. A modified Michaelis–Menten equation that accounts for thallus nitrate fit the uptake data well. U. rigida can accumulate up to about 400–500 μmol nitrate (g DM)−1 in cellular reserves. U. rigida in the Sacca di Goro has higher Km and lower Vmax/Km ratios for nitrate uptake than other chlorophycean species, indicating a low efficiency of uptake at low nitrate concentrations. This low uptake efficiency, and the ability to exploit N availability by storing cellular nitrate pools in excess of immediate growth needs, may represent a physiological response to an eutrophic environment where nitrate is in large supply for most of the year.
