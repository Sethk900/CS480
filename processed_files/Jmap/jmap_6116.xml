Sage-grouse Habitat in Idaho: A Practical Guide For Land Owners and ManagersThe greater sage-grouse is a species in decline across the western United States, including Idaho. As implied by the name, greater sage-grouse depend on sagebrush dominated landscapes for their forage, cover, nesting habitat, and ultimate survival. The deterioration of sagebrush landscapes in the West has been crucial factor in the decline of the greater sage-grouse, which is currently a candidate species under the federal Endangered Species Act. State and federal government land managers, researchers, private landowners, and concerned citizens are leading efforts to conserve this species in Idaho. This book is largely an illustrated synthesis of the 2006 Conservation Plan for Greater Sage-grouse in Idaho, produced by the Idaho Sage-grouse Advisory Committee. Although the information in the 2006 Conservation is based on scientific research, the guidebook is meant to extend what is known about sage-grouse and their habitat to land owners and managers but is not meant to be cited as a science document itself. The intent of this guidebook is to help land owners and managers recognize characteristics of productive and unfavorable sage-grouse habitat throughout the different life stages, prompting better informed approaches to management and conservation. The focus is clearly on ranching, as opposed to other land use activities, because livestock grazing is the major land use that occurs on sage-grouse habitat. The guidebook provides information to recognize and evaluate sage-grouse habitat, but does not recommend specific grazing or land management practices. Those who manage and live within sagebrush landscapes can play a significant role in conserving sage-grouse and the habitat the depend on. This book is just a small part of the larger commitment that is being made to conserve this species.
