Micromorphlogy of recent and buried soils in a semi-arid region of northwestern IndiaProfiles of four recent soils and of eleven soils buried under archaeological sites of known ages were investigated in an area between the Ghaggar Valley and the northern piedmont of the Arawalli Hills in northwestern India. The principal approach was through study of micromorphology. Data were also obtained on mineralogies of several size fractions. Characteristics shared by the recent and buried soils indicate that essentially the same processes operated in their formation. The oldest soils are buried under Protohistoric sites and thus were formed at least 5000 years ago. They are developed on sediments rich in sand-sized mica flakes which indicate an alluvial origin. Others are buried beneath historic sites with ages ranging from 500 B.C. to 1500 A.D. These soils and the recent ones have a silt fraction low in mice. Major features of both buried and recent soils are attributed to biological activity, reflected in extensive channeling and additions of excrements throughout profiles. Local distribution of clay, silt and carbonates indicates translocation of these components. Furthermore, the forms of calcitic features indicate modifications of various kinds. Evidence of biological activity as expressed in characteristics of the soils becomes progressively weaker from older to younger profiles. Soil development seems to have weakened over that period as well. These changes are correlated with the decline with time in the proportions of mica flakes in coarse fractions. The decline is attributed to lack of alluvial sedimentation since the Protohistoric period and to greater transport and winnowing of sediments by wind. We believe this has reduced fertility of the soils formed during the last 4000 years.
