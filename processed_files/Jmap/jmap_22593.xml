Resurrection of the genus Staphisagria J. Hill, sister to all the other Delphinieae (Ranunculaceae)Abstract Molecular sequence data show that the three species oDelphinium subg. Staphisagria (J. Hill) Peterm. form the sister clade to Aconitum L., Aconitella SpachConsolida (DC.) S.F. Gray, and all remaining species of Delphinium L. To account for this finding we resurrect Staphisagria J. Hill (1756). Names in Staphisagria are available for two of the species. We here make the required new combination for the third species, Staphisagria picta (Willd.) F. Jabbour, provide a key to the species, and illustrate one of them.
