Effect of planting date on the phenology, seed yield, and fatty acid composition of three sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) cultivarsFour planting dates (early October to mid-January) were used to obtain a range of environmental conditions for growing three sunflower cultivars. The effect of planting date on phenological development was small compared to that of genotype though the hybrid S0404 responded significantly to photoperiod. Large differences in seed yield occurred between planting dates and this was found to be related to moisture stress during flowering. Fatty acid composition of the seed oil was related to temperature during the seed filling stage and moisture stress during flowering. S. Afr. J. Plant Soil 1985, 2: 207â€“210
