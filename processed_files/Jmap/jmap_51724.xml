Effects of climate change scenarios on Tempranillo grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) ripening: response to a combination of elevated CO2 and temperature, and moderate droughtGreenhouse experiments were conducted to investigate the impact of predicted climate change (elevated CO2, 700 μmol CO2 mol−1 air vs. ambient; elevated temperature, 28/18°C vs. 24/14°C, day/night; and partial irrigation, 40% of field capacity vs. well-irrigated) on grape berry quality characteristics during ripening. Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Tempranillo) fruiting cuttings were used as experimental plant material. Climate change shortened the time between grape veraison and full maturity. At harvest time, many of the grape quality parameters determined were affected by the different grape maturity. The data were re-grouped according to total soluble solids to factor out changes due to the shortened time to maturity, and the effects on grape quality were then re-examined. Under current CO2 and temperature conditions, partial irrigation decreased berry malic acid concentration and facilitated anthocyanins extractability. Elevated CO2 and temperature decreased berry malic acid and total anthocyanins potential in well-irrigated plants and increased tonality index, irrespective of water availability. In partial irrigation conditions, elevated CO2 and temperature hindered the anthocyanins extractability. In summary, results indicate that climate change (elevated CO2, high temperature and partial irrigation) affects phenology and berry quality.
