Estimation and correction of seed recovery bias from moist-soil coresScientists estimate seed abundances to calculate seasonal carrying\ncapacities and assess wetland management actions for waterfowl and other\nwildlife using soil core samples. We evaluated recovery of known\nquantities of moist-soil seeds from whole and subsampled experimental\ncore samples containing 12 seed taxa representing small, medium, and\nlarge size classes. We recovered 86.3% (SE - 1.8) of all seeds added to\nexperimental cores; 8.3% (SE = 1.2) of seeds were destroyed during the\nsieving process and 5.4% (SE = 1.2) were not recovered by observers.\nRecovery rates varied by seed size, but not seed quantity or\ndisproportionate ratios of seed-size classes. Overall seed recovery\nrates were similar between subsampled ((x) over bar = 81.2%, SE = 3.6)\nand whole-processed core samples ((x) over bar = 86.3%, SE = 1.8). We\nused recovery rates to generate size-specific, taxon-specific, and\nconstant correction factors and applied each to actual core sample data.\nSize-specific correction factors increased seed mass estimates in the\nMississippi Alluvial Valley ((x) over bar = 10.1%, SE = 0.32), upper\nMidwest ((x) over bar = 21.2%, SE = 0.61), and both regions combined\n((x) over bar = 15.7%, SE = 0.51) differently, as seed composition in\ncore samples varied regionally. We suggest scientists consider using\nsize-specific correction factors to account for seed recovery bias in\ncore samples because these factors may be applied to a variety of taxa\nand produced similar mass estimates as taxon-specific correction\nfactors. However, if data from core samples are unavailable at the\nresolution of seed size classes, we suggest increasing seed mass\nestimates by 16% to account for seed recovery bias.
