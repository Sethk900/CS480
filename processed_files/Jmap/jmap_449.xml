Dietary supplementation in domestic goats may reduce grazing pressure on vegetation in semi-arid thornscrub.Small herds of domestic goats play an important role in the subsistence of farmers in semi-arid subtropical areas. Dietary supplementation of these animals may help these farmers to improve productivity, but an assessment of compatibility with the sustainable development of these areas is necessary prior to the implementation of such a management strategy. In this study, we examined the effects of diet supplementation on domestic goat foraging behavior during the dry season, by analyzing the forage diet composition of supplemented and unsupplemented goats over a period of four months (February-May). Diet composition was analyzed using direct observation of each animal and recording time spent on consumption of each different plant species. Initial and final live weights of all the animals were taken. Supplementation allowed animals to maintain higher bodyweight with low modification of dietary selection and no increase in consumption of endemic or sensitive plant species. Supplementation could also help to reduce the detrimental consequences of free foraging during the dry season, by decreasing the time spent foraging, which would indirectly benefit the conservation of natural vegetation during this critical period.
