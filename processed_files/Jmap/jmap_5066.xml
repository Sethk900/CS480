The host-plant range of twig-girdling beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae: Lamiinae: Onciderini) of the Atlantic rainforest in southeastern BrazilIn this study, the host-plant range of Onciderini beetles was investigated during 4Â years in an Atlantic rainforest of southeastern Brazil. Twelve species of Onciderini beetles girdled thirty-six plant species in the study site. In total, 1046 plants were girdled by Onciderini beetles as follows: 44.6% were Vochysiaceae, 15% were Mymosaceae, 12% were Melastomataceae, 9% were Lauraceae, 4% were Anacardiaceae and 15% were distributed among Meliaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Bombacaceae, Fabaceae, Thymelaeaceae, Cecropiaceae, Myrtaceae, Lecythidaceae, and Myrsinaceae. Onciderini beetles did not select hosts randomly. Most of the associations (70%) with host plants were caused by polyphagous beetles and different plant families showed different ratios of polyphagous, oligophagous and monophagous Onciderini in the study site.
