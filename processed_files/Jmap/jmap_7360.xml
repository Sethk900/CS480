Observaciones autoecolÃ³gicas en Liolaemus nitidus (Lacertilia: Iguanidae)Abstract In an attempt to provide background information that may lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the genus Liolaemus, the paper documents some basic features of the autecology of Liolaemus nitidus. The study was carried out at two typical localities where L. nitidus is found: at the coast north of Santiago de Chile, and at the Andes ranges east of Santiago. The following parameters were investigated: microhabitat utilization, preferred body temperatures, diet, weight of gonads and of fat bodies, and frequency of regenerated tails. The main findings reported are: 1. Liolaemus nitidus is preferentially a rockâ€dweller, although, when available, it can also be found perching on branches of the bromeliad Puya chilensis. 2. Preferred field body temperatures, evaluated with a quickâ€registering Schultheis thermometer, indicate that L. nitidus has a preferendum of about 35.4Â°C. This mean preferred body temperature is not statistically different from the laboratory preferendum reported in the literature. 3. The diet of L. nitidus was found to vary with body size. Small individuals tend to eat mostly insects, whereas larger individuals tend to have more plant material in their guts. Total gut content is nevertheless relatively heavier for small than for large individuals. These facts are interpreted in the light of previous results obtained with Liolaemus species, and in relation to food availability. Regarding food availability, the above results are consistent with the hypothesis that arthropods are relatively scarce in the xerophytic areas where L. nitidus lives, and therefore these lizards complement their diet with plant material. Arthropod content of the guts was analyzed by size and taxonomic order. The findings are that mean prey size, and size of the largest and of the smallest prey in each stomach tend to be positively correlated with body size of the lizard, thus suggesting prey selectivity. On the other side, the orders most preyed upon by L. nitidus are Coleopterans, Hymenopterans (fundamentally ants), and Homopterans. 4. Correlations between either relative gonad weight or relative weight of the fat bodies, versus dry weight of the lizards are significant and positive. These results suggest that L. nitidus is a relatively Kâ€selected species, where there is a premium for somewhat delayed reproduction and perhaps larger clutches. Heavier fat bodies in the mountain population are interpreted in terms of length of the growing season and different needs to accumulate energy reserves for the unfavorable season. 5. Frequency of regenerated tails is greater in adults than in juveniles, but does not differ between sexes, suggesting that risk of predation would be more associated with the span of time the lizard is exposed to the environment than with differential behavior of males and females. Results are interpreted and compared, when available, with data for other Liolaemus species. These comparisons suggest that L. nigromaculatus and L. chiliensis, two species of similar size and ecological requirements as to L. nitidus, could be among the potentially severest competitors in limiting the geographic distribution of this species.
