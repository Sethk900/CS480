Carbon storage, litterfall and soil CO2 efflux of a larch (Larix leptolepis) standThis study was carried out to evaluate soil carbon cycling of a 36-year-old larch (Larix leptolepis) stand in Korea. The aboveground and soil organic carbon storage, litterfall, and soil respiration rates were measured over two-year periods. The estimated aboveground biomass carbon storage and increment were 4220 gC m(-2) and 150 gC m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Mean organic carbon inputs by needle and total litterfall were 118 gC m(-2) yr(-1) and 168 gC m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. The aboveground carbon increment of the stand was similar to the annual input of carbon from total litterfall. The soil respiration rates correlated exponentially with the soil temperature at a depth of 20 cm (R-2 = 0.86). In addition, the exponential regression equation indicated a relatively strong positive relationship between the soil respiration rates and soil temperature, while there was no significant relationship between the soil respiration rates and the soil moisture content. The annual mean and total soil respiration rates were 0.40 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1) and 3010 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1) over the two-year study period, respectively.
