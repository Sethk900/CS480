Effects of liming and inorganic fertiliser application on soil properties and maize growth and yield in rural agriculture in the Mbizana area, Eastern Cape province, South AfricaA five-year study was conducted to assess the seasonal and medium-term effects of liming and fertilisation of an acid clay loam topsoil on soil properties and on the growth and yield of maize under dry land. Treatments consisted of a control, a once-off application of three levels of dolomitic lime, annual application of two levels of inorganic fertiliser, and three levels of chicken manure. A no-till practice was used with hand planting and fertiliser application. Leaf and soil sampling, as well as harvesting, were performed and analyses done. Soil extractable acidity, acid saturation and leaf Mn and K were reduced significantly, whereas soil pH, soil and leaf P, Ca and Mg increased significantly with an increase in lime application. Liming had no clear effect on soil K, maize leaf N, Cu, Fe and Zn, or on maize grain yield. The higher commercial fertiliser level significantly increased soil P, K and Ca, as well as leaf N, P, K, Cu, Mn and grain yield, compared to the traditional level. These results emphasise the longevity of liming application and that low soil fertility, followed by soil acidity, are the primary factors limiting soil productivity in the study area.
