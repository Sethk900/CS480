Species of genus Schizotheca Hincks (Bryozoa, Cheilostomata) described in the Atlanticâ€Mediterranean region, with notes on some species of Parasmittina OsburnMaterial held in collections, originally ascribed to the genus Schizotheca and originating from the NE Atlantic and Mediterranean, is revised. Two new species are described: Schizotheca carmenae sp. nov. from Azores and Portugal, originally cited as Strophiella tubigera [sic], and Schizotheca buski sp. nov. from Cape Verde and Brazil, originally cited as Schizotheca fissa. Schizotheca talismani, also from Cape Verde, is redescribed from original material and transferred to the genus Parasmittina. The Atlantic species Schizotheca tuberigera is redescribed and a new synonymy is established. Schizotheca aviculifera, from Morocco, is also redescribed and a lectotype designated. A lectotype is also chosen for Schizotheca fissa, type species of the genus. Schizotheca lepida, from north France, is considered to be an unrecognizable species.
