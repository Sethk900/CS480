Converging Kinematic Wave FlowAbstractThe governing equation for converging kinematic wave (KW) flow was derived and compared with laboratory measurement and field tests. The key factors for converging KW flows are found to be excess rainfall depth, surface slope in the radial flow direction, and converging geometry in terms of fan angle and radius. Although the complete analytical solutions for KW flow rate and depth on a converging surface are not yet found in this study, the peak flow under equilibrium condition has been derived for the prediction of design flow. The numerical solution provides a deterministic approach to predict the KW water surface profile on a converging surface. This new method will definitely improve the current practice for determing the boundaries of a floodplain on a converging alluvial fan and the radial flow patterns towards a culvert entrance.
