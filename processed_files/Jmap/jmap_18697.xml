Patterns of soil respiration in a temperate grassland of Kumaun Himalaya, IndiaSoil respiration throughout an annual cycle was measured in a temperate grassland of Kumaun Himalaya (29 degree 7' to 29 degree 26' N and 79 degree 1 5' to 79 degree 38' E) at an average elevation of 1800 m. The CO-2 evolution was significantly higher during the rainy season (101 - 159 mg CO-2 m-2 h-1) than during the winter and summer seasons (35 - 101 mg CO-2 m-2 h-1). The proportion of root respiration to total soil respiration was significantly higher during the winter and summer (29 - 35%) than during the rainy seasons (25-26%). A significant (p lt 0.01) relation existed between soil respiration and soil moisture, soil temperature, total nitrogen, organic carbon and root biomass. This paper also highlights the changes in soil metabolic activity due to deforestation and grazing.
