Mating behaviour, nympho-imaginal development and description of a new Mesabolivar species (Araneae: Pholcidae) from the Brazilian dry forestA new species of Mesabolivar is described from Brazilian forests: Mesabolivar delclaroi. The mating behaviour, postembryonic development, number of egg sacs and eggs, birth rate, number of instars, developmental time until adulthood, sex ratio and size of cephalothorax (per instar) were recorded. The sexual behaviour was described and categorized into four steps: courtship, pre-copulation, copulation and post-copulation. After hatching, individuals presented five instars until maturity. The mean number of eggs (42 ± 16.6) and live births (31.5 ± 3.4) of the first egg sac were significantly greater than that of a second one (23.8 ± 3.8, and 19.25 ± 3.9, respectively). The developmental time from birth to adulthood (130.8 ± 9.6 days) did not differ significantly between egg sacs produced (128.61 ± 11.1). The size of the cephalothorax did not differ among adults or between sexes. The sex ratio revealed a shift in favour of females (4: 3).
