Endoparasites of the European ground squirrel (Spermophilus citellus) (Rodentia: Sciuridae) in central Macedonia, GreeceThe European ground squirrel (Spermophilus citellus) is a small rodent categorized as vulnerable (IUCN). To investigate the parasitic fauna of this species in Greece, faecal samples from 125 animals belonging to six different populations were examined by standard parasitological methods. Parasites were found in 118 of the animals (94.4%). Oocysts of the coccidia Eimeria callospermophili were found in 92 animals (73.6%), Eimeria citelli in 76 (60.8%), Eimeria cynomysis in 41 (32.8%), Eimeria spp. (17.6%), Cryptosporidium spp. in 29 (23.2%), cysts of Entamoeba spp. in 32 animals (25.6%) and eggs of the trematode Brachylaima spp. in seven animals (5.6%). This is the first report of Entamoeba spp., Cryptosporidium spp. and Brachylaima spp. in S. citellus. The possible impact of these findings on the health status of S. citellus and the possible significance to domestic animals or public health is discussed.
