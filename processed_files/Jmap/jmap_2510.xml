METHANE AND NITROUS OXIDE FLUXES FROM URBAN SOILS TO THE ATMOSPHERE.Land-use change is an important driver of soil–atmosphere gas exchange, but current greenhouse-gas budgets lack data from urban lands. Field comparisons of urban and non-urban ecosystems are required to predict the consequences of global urban-land expansion for greenhouse-gas budgets. In a rapidly urbanizing region of the U.S. Great Plains, we measured soil–atmosphere exchange of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) for one year in replicated (<em>n</em> = 3) urban lawn, native shortgrass steppe, dryland wheat– fallow, and flood-irrigated corn ecosystems. All soils were net sinks for atmospheric CH<sub>4</sub>, but uptake by urban, corn, and wheat–fallow soils was half that of native grasslands (−0.30 ± 0.04 g C·m<sup>−2</sup>·yr<sup>−1</sup> [mean ± 1 se]). Urban (0.24 ± 0.03 g N·m<sup>−2</sup>·yr<sup>−1</sup>) and corn (0.20 ± 0.02 g N·m<sup>−2</sup>·yr<sup>−1</sup>) soils emitted 10 times more N<sub>2</sub>O to the atmosphere than native grassland and wheat-fallow soils. Using remotely sensed land-cover data we calculated an upper bound for the contribution of lawns to regional soil–atmosphere gas fluxes. Urban lawns occupied 6.4% of a 1578-km<sup>2</sup> study region, but contribute up to 5% and 30% of the regional soil CH<sub>4</sub> consumption and N<sub>2</sub>O emission, respectively, from land-use types that we sampled. Lawns that cover small portions of the landscape may contribute significantly to regional soil–atmosphere gas exchange.
