Effects of Organophosphorus Insecticides on Sage Grouse in Southeastern IdahoDie-offs of sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) were verified in southeastern Idaho in 1981.  We captured 82 apparently healthy grouse to quantify the effects of organophosphorus insecticides (OP's)  and other pesticides on sage grouse in sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) bordering agricultural lands in July 1985 and 1986. Grouse were fitted with radio collars and tracked through part of each summer. At least 18% of 82 radio-tagged grouse in 1985-86 subsequently occupied fields at the time they were sprayed with OP  insecticides dimethoate or methamidophos. Cholinesterase (ChE) assays of brains and residue analysis of crop contents indicated that 5 and 16% of the marked sample died from OP's in 1985 and 1986, respectively. Approximately 200 sage grouse were present in a block of alfalfa sprayed with dimethoate; 63 of these were later found dead and ChE activity in 43 brains suitable for assay were depressed >50%. Maximum residues in crop contents of dead grouse were 18 Ag/g methamidophos and 30 g/g dimethoate. Intoxicated or dead grouse were observed in or near 6 fields sprayed with dimethoate or methamidophos in 1985-86. Twenty of 31 intoxicated grouse radiotagged after being found in dimethoate-sprayed (1986) alfalfa died. Our study indicates that certain pesticides have the potential for adversely affecting grouse populations.
