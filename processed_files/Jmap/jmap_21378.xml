Lithobius (Monotarsobius) monoforaminis sp. n., a new species of lithobiid centipede from central China (Chilopoda, Lithobiomorpha, Lithobiidae)Abstract The present paper describes a new species Lithobius (Monotarsobius) monoforaminis sp. n. (Lithobiomorpha: Lithobiidae) recently discovered from Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces, Central China. Morphologically it resembles Lithobius (Monotarsobius) minimus Farzalieva, 2006 from Eastern Kazakhstan, but could be well distinguished from the latter having only one pore on the coxae of legs 12â€“15 and different plectrotaxy, and by lacking a wart on the male tibia 15. A key to the Chinese Lithobius (Monotarsobius) species is presented.
