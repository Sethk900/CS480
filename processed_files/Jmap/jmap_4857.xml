Six species of Amazonian Woodcreepers (Aves: Dendrocolaptidae) preying upon lizards and frogsDietary data from a large sample of woodcreepers (16 spp., n = 139), revealed that six species of dendrocolaptids occasionally feed upon lizards and frogs. These birds, which are mainly insectivorous, encounter and feed on lizards while perching on tree trunks, probably in association with army-ant swarm feeding behaviour. Frog intake may be related to declines in the abundance of invertebrate prey. The bones recovered were identified as one small species of gecko, Gonatodes humeralis, and at least one anuran. We estimate that in the entire sample, about eight lizards and two frogs were ingested. The partially digested gecko material allows determination of which bones are more resistant to digestion, although it is possible that these elements were differentially retained in the stomach. These elements correspond to the more frequently preserved bones in the fossil record of geckos, indicating that the same portions of the skeleton persist under the processes of both digestion and fossilization.
