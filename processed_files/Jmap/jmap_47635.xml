Hurricane forcing on chlorophyll-a concentration off the northeast coast of the U.S.The effect of known physical disturbances caused by hurricanes on chlorophyll-a concentration ([Chl]) is ascertained using remote sensing. This study focuses on all seven hurricanes which affected the northeast (NE) Coast of the U.S. during the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensorâ€™s (SeaWiFS) lifetime. It is shown that [Chl] increases significantly across the continental shelf of the eastern seaboard after the passage of a hurricane, with also a marked filamentation. The disturbances caused by hurricanes on the biological scale constitute strong and persistent events providing further evidence of the role that upwelling and mixing exert on [Chl] variation.
