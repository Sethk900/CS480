Aliquid novi ex Africa? Lamyctes africanus (Porath, 1871) found in Europe (Chilopoda: Lithobiomorpha: Henicopidae)Lamyctes africanus Porath, 1871) was collected from several localities in Denmark in 2011 – the first records of the species in outdoor habitats in Europe. Based on Danish specimens, which are all females, suggesting parthenogenesis, L. africanus is re-described and compared with Lamyctes emarginatus (Newport, 1844). Several previous records of L. africanus are shown probably to concern other species. An account of species distribution and habitats suggests a typical pioneering species. The taxonomy of the genus Lamyctes is discussed, including a detailed account of the use of antennomere number in species description and a key to the four European Lamyctes species. Two mitochondrial genes, 16S and COI from Danish specimens are sequenced and analysed but do not contribute to clarifying the identity of the species.
