Octopus mimicking its follower reef fishWe describe a possible example of social mimicry between Octopus insularis and the small grouper Cephalopholis fulva, which frequently associate during foraging at Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, Brazil. The octopus, when swimming backwards, jetâ€propelled, becomes similar in colour and shape to accompanying C. fulva individuals and is therefore less conspicuous within the fish group. We regard this as an instance of social mimicry, a form of protection against visuallyâ€oriented predators in which different species similar in shape and colour mingle for the advantage of grouping. Even when swimming backwards alone, O. insularis may become similar to foraging C. fulva individuals, another putatively protective behaviour. We suggest that the feeding association commonly found between O. insularis and C. fulva minimized the evolutionary costs for the origin of mimicking by the octopus. â€ Retired and associated as voluntary researcher.
