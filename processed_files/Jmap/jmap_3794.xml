Biomass estimation on grazed and ungrazed rangelands using spectral indicesAboveground biomass was estimated on the shortgrass steppe of Eastern Colorado using Landsat TM Tasseled Cap green vegetation index (GVI), brightness index (BI), and wetness index (WI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the red waveband (RED), for two grazing treatments (moderately grazed or ungrazed). Field measurements of standing crop were obtained on six sites per grazing treatment. Ordinary least squares regression models of biomass as a function of one or more indices were tested for grazed, ungrazed, and combined grazed and ungrazed data. Biomass from grazed sites was linearly related to GVI, NDVI, WI, and RED indices (R2 0.62-0.67). Ungrazed sites produced no significant relations. With combined ungrazed and grazed data, biomass was not significantly related to GVI, NDVI, WI, or BI, and was poorly related to the RED index (R2 0.35). When grazing treatments were treated as dummy variables for the combined data, the RED index was moderately related to biomass (R2 0.70). These results suggest that information about grazing utilization is useful for estimating aboveground biomass in rangelands. The RED index appears to be sensitive to biomass variations for green vegetation and to a lesser extent dry or senescent vegetation when relatively bright soil backgrounds are present which is often the case for semi-arid environments such as the shortgrass steppe.
