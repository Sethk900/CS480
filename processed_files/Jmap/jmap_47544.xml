Frugivory by Sturnira lilium bats (Phyllostomidae) on Solanum mauritianum (Solanaceae) in southeastern BrazilPhyllostomid bats constitute one key seed disperser group in the Neotropical forests and coadaptation between solanacean plants and phyllostomid bats might have occurred. The main goals of this study were: (1) to identify the potential disperser of S. mauritianum and to determine fruit removal rate; (2) to determine the effect of seed passage through the digestive system of S. lilium on germination; and (3) to describe the main fruit characteristics and architectural pattern of fruit display, to assess whether S. mauritianum fruits are exposed above the crown facilitating their removal by bats. Sturnira lilium was the most frequent and reliable fruit consumer of S. mauritianum and Rusty-margined Guan (Cracidae: Penelope superciliaris) and russet rice rat (Muridae: Euryoryzomys russatus) were potential secondary seed dispersers. Sturnira lilium defecated intact seeds that had a higher germination rate than non-ingested seeds. The greenish fruits emit a strong odor of night-ripening fruit. These characteristics, added to high fruit exposition index (2.4) indicating infructescences entirely exposed on the crowns, agree with the chiropterochory syndrome. Our results show that S. lilium is an effective seed disperser of S. mauritianum. Still, further studies are needed to understand the actual contribution of the non-bat fauna to seed dispersal.
