Parasites and Infectious Diseases of Greater Sage-Grouse.We report the parasites, infectious diseases, and noninfectious diseases related to toxicants found in Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) across its range. Documentation of population-level effects is rare, although researchers have responded to the recent emergence of West Nile virus with rigorous efforts. West Nile virus shows greater virulence and potential population-level effects than any infectious agent detected in Greater Sage-Grouse to date. Research has demonstrated that (1) parasites and diseases can have population-level effects on grouse species; (2) new infectious diseases are emerging; and (3) habitat fragmentation is increasing the number of small, isolated populations of Greater Sage-Grouse. Natural resource management agencies need to develop additional research and systematic monitoring programs for evaluating the role of micro-and macro parasites, especially West Nile virus, infectious bronchitis and other corona viruses, avian retroviruses, Mycoplasma spp., and Eimeria spp. and associated enteric bacteria affecting sage-grouse populations.
