Soil factors affecting tree growth and root development in a citrus orchardTree- and root-growth parameters correlated well with a number of soil properties Useful relationships were established between unconfined penetrometer resistance, air capacity (at FWC), tree growth and root development. Tree and root growth were also restricted in the soil where the long-term air-filled porosity was almost continuously less than 15%. S. Afr. J. Plant Soil 1984, 1: 39â€“47
