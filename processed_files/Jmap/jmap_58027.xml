Influence of Spatial Precipitation Sampling on Hydrological Response at the Catchment ScaleAbstractRetrieving precipitation data from a rain gauge network is a classical and common practice in hydrology and climatology. These data represent the key input in hydrological modeling to reproduce, for example, the characteristics of a flood phenomenon. The accuracy of the model results is strongly dependent on the consistency of the monitoring network in terms of spatial scale, i.e.,Â network density and location of the rain gauges and time resolution. In this context, several studies have been carried out to analyze how the rainfall sampling influences the estimation of total runoff volume. The aim of this paper is to use a physically based and distributed-parameter hydrologic model to investigate how the number and the spatial distribution of a rain gauge network influence the estimation of the hydrograph and its characteristics in conjunction with different spatial and temporal characteristics of rainfall forcing and different soil-type characteristics. The TIN-based real-time integrated basin simulator (tRIBS) hydrologic model was used to simulate hydrologic response at Baron Fork Basin, Oklahoma. Downscaled next-generation radar (NEXRAD) measurements were assumed to represent the true precipitation distribution over the basin. Additional precipitation fields have been derived from the interpolation of eight fictitious rain gauges randomly placed in the area. The hydrological response from tRIBS that is driven by these precipitation fields has been compared with the response of the model forced with NEXRAD precipitation. The analysis has been carried out assuming first simplified spatial distributions of soil characteristics and then the real soil-type distribution. Results have shown the dependence of the best rain gauges configuration for the estimation of runoff on the spatiotemporal characteristics of storm events and the soil-type distribution.
