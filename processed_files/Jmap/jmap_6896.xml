New Species of the Genera Ischioscia and Andenoniscus, Terrestrial Isopods from Panama (Crustacea, Isopoda)Three new species of terrestrial isopods from the leaf litter of a rain forest near Gamboa, canal zone, Panama, are described. They belong to the genera Ischioscia Verhoeff, 1928 and Andenoniscus Verhoeff, 1941, occurring in Central America and northern South America. I. panamensis spec. nov. is a typical member of the genus, whereas I. zebricolor spec. nov. differs remarkably from its congeners, both in colour and morphological aspects. Andenoniscus schmalfussi spec. nov. belongs to a different phyletic line of the so-called "Philosciidae", a paraphyletic group. The generic position of both I. zebricolor spec. nov. and A. schmalfussi spec. nov. is discussed, together with the evolution of specific characters and the biogeography of these Central American Oniscidea.
