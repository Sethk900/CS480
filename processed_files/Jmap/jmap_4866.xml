New records and hosts for three species of pseudionine bopyrids (Crustacea: Isopoda: Bopyridae) parasitizing munidid squat lobsters (Crustacea: Anomura: Munididae) in Philippine watersThree species of pseudionine bopyrid isopods infesting four species of munidid squat lobsters are reported from Philippine waters: Pleurocryptella laevis (Richardson, 1910) from Agononida analoga (Macpherson, 1993); Aporobopyrus retrorsa (Richardson, 1910) from Munida philippinensis Macpherson and Baba, 1993 and Munida kuboi Yanagita, 1943; and Munidion laterale Richardson, 1910 from Paramunida scabra (Henderson, 1885). All of these hosts, except for Paramunida scabra, are recorded for the first time bearing parasitic isopods.
