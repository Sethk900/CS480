Breeding biology and nesting site selection by the spurâ€winged plover Hoplopterus spinosus in the Evros Delta, NE GreeceThe breeding biology of the spurâ€winged plover Hoplopterus spinosus was studied in the Evros Delta during 2003. Nest selection was studied at a microhabitat level. The factors found to affect this selection were: distance from the nearest bush, sum of angles of optical scope on a radius of 50m, sum of angles of optical scope on a radius of 100m and distance from the nearest conspecific nest. The logistic regression model identified the factors: sum of angles of optical scope on a radius of 100m, surface covered by water, surface covered by bare ground and surface covered by the dominant plant as important microhabitat features for the prediction of the nest location. Regarding breeding performance, hatching success was estimated at 42%, while fledging success was estimated at 41%. Irregular flooding and trampling by grazing animals were the main factors found to affect nest failure. Management proposals for the protection of the species were given in relation to these factors.
