Two new species of Lecanora sensu stricto (Lecanoraceae, Ascomycota) from east AfricaAbstract The new sorediate species Lecanora kenyana from Mount Kenya and Lecanora orientoafricana from the Rift Valley in Kenya are described. Lecanora kenyana has red-brown apothecia with a constricted base, a melacarpella–type amphithecium, pulicaris–type epihymenium, a hyaline hypothecium, and contains usnic acid as major constituent. Lecanora orientoafricana is characterized by having a dark hypothecium, pulicaris-type amphithecium, chlarotera-epihymenium, and contains atranorin and gangaleoidin. A phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and a Bayesian approach based on DNA sequence data of mtSSU and ITS rDNA support that both new species belong to Lecanora sensu stricto and cluster with species containing usnic acid or having a dark hypothecium, respectively.
