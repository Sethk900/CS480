A revision of the Caridina gracilirostris De Man, 1892, species group, with descriptions of two new taxa (Decapoda; Caridea; Atyidae)Reâ€examination of the syntypes of Caridina gracilirostris De Man, 1892, shows that the type series is composed of three species. These three species are similar in the form of the rostrum, but can be differentiated easily by a combination of rostral formula and sexual appendages. To stabilize the taxonomic status of these species, a lectotype for C. gracilirostris is selected. A lectotype for Caridina appendiculata Jalihal and Shenoy, 1998, is also designated from among the remaining syntypes of C. gracilirostris. A new species, C. neglecta, is described. Caridina gracilirostris and C. gracilima Lanchester, 1901, are redescribed and figured, and C. appendiculata is transferred to the C. nilotica species group. A new species group is also recognized for C. gracilirostris, C. neglecta, C. gracilima, and a new species, C. longifrons. The C. gracilirostris species group is defined here as taxa possessing a rostrum with subapical teeth, fewer than 10 dorsal teeth, and without any postorbital teeth.
