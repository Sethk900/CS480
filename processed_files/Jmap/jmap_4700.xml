Diversity analysis in Ethiopian and some exotic collections of linseedSixty linseed accessions predominantly from Ethiopia were evaluated for 11 characters in a randomised complete block design with three replications under glasshouse conditions at the UFS, during 2000 and 2001. The major objectives were to assess the diversity of the accessions, and to estimate broad sense heritability and predicted genetic gains of various characters. The mean squares of the accessions were highly significant for most characters. The phenotypic coefficient of variation ranged from 1.90% for seeds/capsule to 142.72% for plant height, while the genotypic CV varied between 1.52% and 118.88% for the same characters. Estimates of heritability ranged from 15.60% for seed yield/plant to 85.82% for initial days to flowering. Values of predicted genetic gams varied from 3.16% for days to maturity to 24.26% for plant height The first five principal components had eigenvalues of 66.43% of the total variance. The first principal component, which accounted for about 20% of the variability was due to days to flowering, maturity and seeds/capsule. Cluster analysis grouped the 60 accessions into 11 major classes. Hence, this study demonstrated the existence of extensive diversity among the evaluated germplasm of linseed.
