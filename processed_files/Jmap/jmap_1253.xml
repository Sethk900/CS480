Potential Use of Uniola paniculata Rhizome Fragments for Dune Restoration.<b>Abstract</b><em>Uniola paniculata</em> (sea oats) rhizomes uprooted by hurricanes and deposited as wrack could be salvaged and replanted in dune restoration. To test this unexplored technique, percent tiller emergence was observed for 4 years from <em>U. paniculata</em> rhizomes replanted after submersion in seawater; air exposure of 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 11 days; freshwater rinse; and reburial in pots (watered) or on the beach (with or without supplemental water). In addition, <em>U. paniculata</em> rhizomes uprooted by Hurricane Georges were experimentally planted, and effects of soil salinity and moisture on emergence were tested in the greenhouse. Tiller emergence declined with increasing length of air exposure and decreasing size of rhizome. Tiller survival was enhanced by rainfall, rinsing with salt or fresh water during exposure and immediately after planting or supplemental beach watering. Although emergence was not reduced by soil salinity of 1,800 μS/cm, emergence was reduced by soil salinity of 5,800 μS/cm. Across the 4 years of the study tiller emergence from treated rhizomes varied considerably. <em>U. paniculata</em> rhizomes lost bud viability after 3-5 days of beach exposure, unless fresh water from rainfall, wet burlap storage, or watering was applied within 3 days. Bud viability was extended through 11 days when supplied with water. Thus, reburial within 3-11 days after a storm is a viable restoration technique.
