Leaf characters of various tea clones in relation to qualityThe leaves of ten different tea clones were investigated to explore the possibility that structural differences exist between clones and that morphological characters relate to the quality of the infusion. Our results revealed a significant negative correlation between TF-values and the average length of trichomes occurring on the abaxial side of the second leaf. A significant positive correlation was found between the average length of the first layer of palisade parenchyma cells and the total chlorophyll content of the second leaf.
