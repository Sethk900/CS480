CHANGING SOIL RESPIRATION IN A GEOPHYTE-RICH PANNONIAN FOREST FROM SNOWMELT UNTIL PEAK LEAFINGThe investigation was carried out in a temperate deciduous forest from snowmelt until peak leafing. Soil respiration was measured in 5 permanent plots (both litter covered and bare) with closed chamber technique. Most important abiotic factors (T-soil, SWC, PPFD) were continuously recorded, and their correlation to soil CO2 efflux were demonstrated in this paper. It was proved that transitional periods have a significant role both in the magnitude and temporal dynamics of soil carbon flux. The results can also be used for modelling the soil respiration in temperate forests characterized by contrasting climatic seasons.
