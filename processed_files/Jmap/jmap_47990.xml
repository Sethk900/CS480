Nonmarine Ostracoda (Crustacea) from Jeju Island, South Korea, including descriptions of two new speciesCollections of brackish and freshwater ostracods on Jeju Island, South Korea, yielded 26 species, including two new species belonging to the genera Cyclocypris and Cypretta, and nine new records for the Korean fauna: Bradleytriebella tuberculata (Hartmann, 1964), Strandesia flavescens Klie, 1932, Potamocypris variegata (Brady & Norman, 1889), Heterocypris salina (Brady, 1868), Stenocypris hirutai Smith and Kamiya, 2006, Ishizakiella miurensis (Hanai, 1957), Terrestricythere ivanovae Schornikov, 1969, Limnocythere sp. and Tanycypris alfonsi Nagler, Geist and Matzke-Karasz, 2014. Tanycypris alfonsi is also known from Germany, where it is considered to be an alien species. The Limnocythere species belongs to the stationis group, which consists of another eight species, and is probably undescribed. A lack of males hinders its description, but its presence in Korea is significant; including the record herein, seven of the group inhabit North-East Asia, indicating the group may have originated in this region.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:74FA8742-D301-4EC0-B058-021EE1CDFCB0
