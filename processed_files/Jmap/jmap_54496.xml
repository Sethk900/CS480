Genesis and environmental significance of a buried middle pleistocene soil in Eastern EnglandA Middle Pleistocene soil in eastern England, developed in fluvial and intertidal sediments and buried beneath till deposits, was studied using macromorphological, physical, chemical and micromorphological techniques. The major pedogenic processes active in its formation were clay illuviation, rubification, gleying, mineral weathering and cryogenic disruption. A development sequence for the soil was proposed on the basis of superposition of various macro- and micromorphological features. Three phases of clay illuviation were identified with periods of intense disruption occurring between and after the second and third phases. The second phase of disturbance was related to cryogenesis during the early Anglian stage of the British Ouaternary succession. Illuvial clay coatings were fragmented or deformed and duplex textural lamellae a-features developed. More large-scale disruption followed to form periglacial involutions and small contraction cracks, the latter being infilled with translocated silt. At some stage, the eluvial horizon was eroded and coversand began to be deposited. A gradual change to a more arid, permafrost environment led to development of sand wedges. As the Anglian glacier advanced, the soil was glacitectonically deformed and buried beneath till. Later melting of the permafrost led to deformation of the larger sand wedges.
