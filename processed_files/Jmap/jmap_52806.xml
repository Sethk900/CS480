Three new Scandinavian species of Culicoides (Culicoides): C. boyi sp. nov., C. selandicus sp. nov. and C. kalix sp. nov. (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae)In the context of a major monitoring program of Culicoides in Denmark and Sweden due to the appearance of bluetongue disease in 2007â€“2008, a large number of specimens were collected by light traps and sorted morphologically, with COI barcodes generated for selected specimens.  New information  Three species are described as new to science based on both morphological and molecular data: Culicoides (Culicoides) boyi sp. nov. (Denmark: Jutland), C. (C.) selandicus sp. nov. (Denmark: Zealand) and C. (C.) kalix sp. nov. (Sweden: Norrbotten). All are diagnosed morphologically as well as by molecular barcoding. A key to slide-mounted females of all Scandinavian species of Culicoides (Culicoides) is presented.
