Substrate utilization pattern, biomass and activity of microbial communities in a sequence of heavy metal-polluted paddy soilsThe microbial biomass, activity and substrate utilization pattern of seven Chinese paddy soils with different heavy metal concentrations in the vicinity of a Cuâ€“Zn smelter was investigated. Microbial biomass and basal respiration were negatively affected by the elevated metal levels. Two important biological parameters, namely, the microbial biomass-C (Cmic)/organic C (Corg) ratio and metabolic quotient were closely correlated to heavy metal stress. There was a significant decrease in the Cmic/Corg ratio and an increase in the metabolic quotient with increasing metal concentration. Multivariate analysis of sole carbon source utilization pattern demonstrated that heavy metal pollution had a significant impact on microbial community structure and there was a threshold metal concentration for substrate utilization pattern. However, the average well colour development (AWCD) of the carbon sources in Biolog plates did not vary in a consistent manner with the microbial biomass or heavy metal concentration.
