Development and demography of Phasmahyla jandaia (Bokermann and Sazima, 1978) (Anura, Hylidae) tadpoles in an Atlantic Forest site, southeastern BrazilMortality rates are often high during the anuran tadpole stage, making demographic parameters in this phase of their life cycle important to the understanding of population demography. Nevertheless, information on mortality rates or population size is lacking for most Brazilian anurans. Herein we report on the demographic parameters of Phasmahyla jandaia (Hylidae) during the larval stage, including number of individuals through time, mortality rates and time of recruitment. Tadpole recruitment occurred yearâ€round, although froglet recruitment to the terrestrial habitat was restricted to the warm, rainy season. This trend seems to result in high plasticity of the tadpole developmental period. Mortality rates decreased with advancing tadpole stage, totalling 77% during the whole aquatic phase. Survivorship can be regarded as intermediate compared with other anurans for which data are available, and is in accordance with a high investment in egg size and the low number of eggs laid by P. jandaia.
