Sulfur status of four uncultivated soil profiles in northern BavariaThe total amounts and principal fractions of sulfur were determined by horizons in four profiles differing in water regimes and reactions. Two were in unmanaged grassland (Dystrochrept and Rendoll) and two under deciduous hardwood forest (Eutrochrept and Fluvaquent). Sulfur reserves were also calculated from the data on the profiles. Total amounts of sulfur ranged from 526 to 735 ppm in the surface horizons, which were highest within profiles. Amounts decreased regularly with depth except for a reversal in the deepest horizon of the Fluvaquent. The minimum was 37 ppm in the IICv horizon, deepest in the Dystrochrept. Total sulfur is well correlated with both nitrogen and organic carbon. The principal fractions consist of three that were easily extractable, three that were difficultly extractable and one that was insoluble. Easily extractable forms averaged 17% of the total sulfur among all horizons with a range from 2.6 to 51.4%. Organic forms are dominant in these soils with 70% or more of the total in such forms except in the IICv horizon of the Dystrochrept. Of the organic sulfur, the average proportions of the element in proteins or bonded to carbon in unknown compounds averaged 52% of the total sulfur, with that in ester sulfates accounting for an additional 28%, on the average. Amino acid-sulfur comprised as much as 48.6% of the carbonbound element in some humus-rich horizons. More of the sulfur was present in cysteine than in methionine. Sulfur reserves in the soils ranged from 1153 to 4305 kg/ha-solum. These amounts bracket those that have been reported in the literature.
