No increase in colonization rate of boreal bryophytes close to propagule sourcesKnowledge of the process of recolonization, and which temporal and spatial scale it operates on, is central to our understanding of species distributions, metapopulation dynamics, regional extinction risks, and ecosystem resilience. In this study the recolonization pattern of boreal forest bryophytes was investigated in stands that had been clear-cut ~50 years ago. Species known to be sensitive to clear-cutting were inventoried in 23 mature forest stands and in adjacent young stands at 10, 20, 40, and 80 m from the former forestâ€“clear-cut edge. Based on previous studies showing that bryophytes tend to be dispersal limited at local population levels, it was hypothesized that the recolonizaton of many bryophyte species should be higher closer to the mature forest edge. It was also hypothesized that some species would show full recovery, while for others the young stands would still be inhospitable. All these patterns were found for individual species, but the main pattern was, however, quite different. Most species had started to recolonize the young stands (i.e., little or much, depending on species), but without any tendency of a higher colonization rate close to the mature stands. Possible explanations for the limited signs of positive influence of local propagule sources might be microsite limitation or that the local propagule availability displays a rapid decline from its sources and is masked by a higher regional propagule rain. For organisms with light propagules able to build up a regional background level, the role of mature forest stands in the recolonization process of the matrix may rather be to contribute to the regional background level of spores in the landscape than to affect the adjacent stands directly.
