The soil mite genus Conchogneta (Acari, Oribatida, Autognetidae), with new findings from MongoliaAbstract This work deals with taxonomy, geographical distribution as well as known ecology of oribatid mites of the genus Conchogneta Grandjean, 1963 in the world. The majority of species belonging to this genus is known to be widely distributed in Europe, but only three of them are found in other areas of the northern hemisphere. Most species of Conchogneta are inhabitants of litter of various types of forestas, terricolous and epiphytic bryophytes, epiphytic lichens, and soil of steppe, river valleys, moor, oligotrophic bogs, floodland assemblages etc. A new species, Conchogneta glabrisensillata sp. n. is described, and another species, Conchogneta traegardhi (Forsslund, 1947) is redescribed from the northern and western parts of Mongolia, respectively. Conchogneta is recorded for the first time for the fauna of Mongolia. The species status of Conchogneta dalecarlica (Forsslund, 1947) is discussed. Species descriptions are accompanied with detailed illustrations. Furthermore, a key is provided for the identification of adults of the known species of Conchogneta in the world.
