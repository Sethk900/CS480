Oxygen isotope composition of quartz in soils developed on late Quaternary volcanic ashes in JapanOxygen isotope compositions of quartz isolated from 25 soil samples developed on late Quaternary volcanic ashes in Japan were determined. The δ18O values for aerosol sized quartz (1–10 μm in diameter) ranged from +10.9 to +17.5%. The variation is attributed to mixing of long-distance aeolian dust (δ18O=+16 to +17%) with variable amounts of local volcanic quartz (δ18O=+6 to + 8%). The δ18O values of soil quartz decreased systematically with the increasing particle size. The contribution of quartz derived from long-distance aeolian dust is higher in fine fractions (< 53 μm) than in coarser fractions ( > 53 μm). Fine-grained quartz is often associated with hornblende in soils derived from volcanic ashes. Because large oxygen isotope fractionations (∼ 79%) between fine quartz (δ18O=+13%) and hornblende (δ18O=+6%) in bulk soil samples are unlikely in a normal magmatic equilibrium process, such fractionations are considered to result from post-depositional (secondary) mixing of the fine quartz incorporated by the eolian process. On the other hand, small oxygen isotope fractionations (< 2%) between coarse-grained quartz (+8%) and hornblende (+6%) indicate a volcanic origin.
