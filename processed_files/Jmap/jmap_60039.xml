GIS-Based Decision Support System for Dam Break Flood Management under Uncertainty with Two-Dimensional Numerical SimulationsAbstractA geographical information system (GIS)-based decision support system has been developed for dam-break flood management based on realistic two-dimensional flood simulations. With the ability of interacting with and using classified remote sensing (RS) image layers and other GIS feature layers like zoning layer, survey database, and census block boundaries, it can be used for flood damage calculations and loss-of-life estimations. It also provides a user-friendly interface that allows construction of user-defined criteria, such as stage-damage curves, running computations, and visualization of the results. The Monte Carlo Simulation method is used to take into account uncertainties in various variables and parameters, and event tree analysis is used to estimate the population dynamics. The analysis of a dam-break flood management strategy for Sinclair Dam in Milledgeville, Georgia is chosen as a case study to demonstrate the capabilities of the decision support system. The test results validated by HEC-RAS and HEC-FDA software indicate that this new system provides a very versatile and reliable environment for estimating various flood damage and may greatly enhance decision-making processes for future design of flood proofing facilities.
