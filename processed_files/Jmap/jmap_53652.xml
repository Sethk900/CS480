Estimation of comparative water transmission in two pairs of adjacent virgin and cultivated pedons in wisconsinHydraulic properties and soil morphology of principal soil horizons of paired virgin and cultivated pedons, each pair with identical soil classifications, were studied at two sites. The capacity of the two cultivated soils to transmit water under saturated conditions was reduced as compared with the virgin soil, whereas this capacity generally increased in unsaturated soil at corresponding moisture tensions. Compacted layers below the Ap had a drying effect on the overlying Ap at a wide range of flow rates, whereas a wetting effect resulted in Al horizons of the virgin pedons at similar flow rates, representing unsaturated flow. Extrapolation for interpretive purposes of hydraulic conductivity data measured in a representative pedon of a mapping unit to pedons in identical mapping units elsewhere has to proceed with care, as differences may be substantial. A rather wide range of physical properties is acceptable in a pedogenic soil unit when broad qualitative soil map interpretations are made. However, specific interpretations require more detailed data, as is illustrated with examples relating to soil suitability for on-site liquid waste disposal.
