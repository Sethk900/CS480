SEASONAL VARIATION IN SOIL RESPIRATION OF CERTAIN TROPICAL GRASSLAND COMMUNITIESFour different grassland communities of Ujjain [India] were evaluated for total soil respiration. The inverted box alkali absorption method (Walter and Haber 1957) was used for the quantitative estimation of soil respiration and the results were expressed in terms of CO2 evolution. Soil respiration rates were higher in the Sehima community in the rainy season. A significant reduction occurred in summer season. Soil temperature and soil moisture were related linearly with CO2 evolution. The root biomass values were determined, and a positive correlation was found between soil respiration rates and the root biomass values.
