Herbaceous layer development during spring does not deplete soil nitrogen in the Portuguese montado.Nitrogen (N) content in the soil and in the herbaceous biomass were monitored during spring of 2004-2006 to determine how the herbaceous layer development influences soil N availability in the montado ecosystem of southern Portugal. Highest (246.6 +/- 52.7 g m-2) and lowest (123.2 +/- 89.5 g m-2) peak biomass occurred in 2006 and 2005 respectively. Total soil N within the top 20 cm soil profile ranged between 0.2 +/- 0.1% in February and 0.41 +/- 0.2% in May, while available soil N was lowest (5 +/- 2 â•¬â•g g-1soil) in February but increased three-to-five fold in March and was >17.5 â•¬â•g g-1soil at senescence in May. Significant (p < 0.001) increase in total N in the aboveground pool occurred between February and May. There was however, no decay in soil N content. Instead, the herbaceous vegetation enhanced soil N input and N retention in the ecosystem. Most of the herbaceous plants were annuals with large reserves of organic N at senescence, which returned to the soil as detritus. The herbaceous vegetation is a critical component of the montado that contributes to N recharge and cycling within the ecosystem.
