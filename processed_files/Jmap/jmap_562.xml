Soil water property variations in three adjacent land use types in the Rift Valley area of EthiopiaThis study investigated the effects of land use change on infiltration and moisture content of soils in three land use types. A total of 81 soil and core samples (3 replications × 3 treatments × 3 profiles × 3 soil depths) were used to determine parameters that may affect the infiltration properties of soils. The infiltration rate was measured in the field using double-ring infiltrometer with three replicates in each land use type. Results showed that infiltration rates were generally slow in the open grazed and cultivated lands suggesting high potential for runoff, limited percolation, and very low amount of water available in the soil profiles. The accumulated infiltration in soils under cultivation and open-grazing was smaller than the controlled grazing by approximately 57%. Similarly, cultivation and open-grazing had reduced the soil moisture content by 29 and 33%, respectively, compared to the controlled grazing. Surface soil compaction, higher dry bulk density and lower soil organic carbon, appeared to be the principal factors for the low infiltration capacity and moisture content of the soils. Therefore, dry land management, with long term tree cover and well regulated grazing system, is very crucial for the sustainable ecosystem functioning of this environmentally fragile area.
