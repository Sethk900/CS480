Effect of the amount of surface maize residue on infiltration and soil loss from a clay loam soilSix levels of maize stover, expressed as percentage ground cover (0â€“75%) were compared under a rainfall simulator to assess the effect of surface residues on infiltration and soil loss on a clay loam soil with a 3,5% slope. Increasing the percentage ground cover resulted in increased infiltration and was even more effective in controlling soil loss. Under the experimental conditions a minimum residue ground cover of 30% was required to keep runoff and soil loss within acceptable limits.
