Life in bromeliads: reproductive behaviour and the monophyly of the Scinax perpusillus species group (Anura: Hylidae)Several aspects of the reproductive behaviour of species of the Scinax perpusillus group (S. perpusillus, S. vâ€signatus, S. littoreus, and three other not yet described species) obtained from direct field observations and nocturnal video filming are presented and evaluated. Males of the observed species have behavioural characters, including aspects of their call, that are indicative of territory defence. Vocalizations are elaborate and represent intraâ€ and interâ€sexual communication mechanisms. Females present behaviour relating to the inspection of eggâ€laying sites (bromeliad leafâ€tanks), reduced and partitioned clutch. This set of behaviours is not only indicative of a sophisticated control mechanism over egg laying and spermatozoid release, but also of the existence of a behavioural repertoire that probably originated in the ancestor of these species and could be considered a synapomorphy for this group of species. Furthermore, the behaviours described herein comprise a new reproductive strategy for frogs that reproduce in bromeliads.
