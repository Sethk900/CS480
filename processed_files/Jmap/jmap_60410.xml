Rethinking satellite-based solar irradiance modelling The SOLIS clear-sky moduleAccurate solar irradiance data are not only of particular importance for the assessment of the radiative forcing of the climate system, but also absolutely necessary for efficient planning and operation of solar energy systems. Within the European project Heliosat-3, a new type of solar irradiance scheme is developed. This new type will be based on radiative transfer models (RTM) using atmospheric parameter information retrieved from the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite (clouds, ozone, water vapour) and the ERS-2/ENVISAT satellites (aerosols, ozone).This paper focuses on the description of the clear-sky module of the new scheme, especially on the integrated use of a radiative transfer model. The linkage of the clear-sky module with the cloud module is also briefly described in order to point out the benefits of the integrated RTM use for the all-sky situations. The integrated use of an RTM within the new Solar Irradiance Scheme SOLIS is applied by introducing a new fitting function called the modified LambertâBeer (MLB) relation. Consequently, the modified LambertâBeer relation and its role for an integrated RTM use are discussed. Comparisons of the calculated clear-sky irradiances with ground-based measurements and the current clear-sky module demonstrate the advantages and benefits of SOLIS. Since SOLIS can provide spectrally resolved irradiance data, it can be used for different applications. Beside improved information for the planning of solar energy systems, the calculation of photosynthetic active radiation, UV index, and illuminance is possible.
