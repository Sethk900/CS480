Rainfall Intensity-Duration-Frequency Relationships for Andhra Pradesh, India: Changing Rainfall Patterns and Implications for Runoff and Groundwater RechargeAbstractAccurate and current rainfall characterization is an important tool for water-related system design and management. Updated rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) relationships in peninsular India were developed; impacts on runoff and groundwater recharge attributable to changes in rainfall characteristics are discussed. Two data sets were used from gage in Hyderabad city, the capital of Andhra Pradesh: hourly rainfall data for the 19 years from 1993–2011 and daily rainfall data for the 30 years from 1982–2011. Hourly data were used to develop updated rainfall IDF relationships; daily data were used for trend analysis of threshold-based rainfall events. IDF curves were developed for return periods of 2, 5, 10, 15, 25, 50, 75, and 100 years for 1-, 2-, 4-, 8-, and 24-h durations. The updated IDF relationships showed a significant change in rainfall characteristics compared with older relationships for the region surrounding Hyderabad, India; they showed greater rainfall intensities across all durations and return periods. Greater intensity storms may reduce groundwater recharge and increase runoff, making the surface storage of runoff increasingly important to enhance recharge and reduce flooding risks.
