Trophic and Spatial Niches of two Large-sized Species of Leptodactylus (Anura) in Southeastern BrazilLeptodactylus ocellatus (LO) and L. labyrinthicus (LL) are known to prey on other frogs. Here we compare their food habits based on the analysis of stomach contents and their spatial distribution when in sympatry. LO was found most frequently near stream banks, and LL on the margins of lakes and ponds. LO was found within 10 m of permanent water bodies; LL frequently used ponds far from lakes and rivers. Coleoptera, Formicidae, and Isoptera comprised 52% of the prey types identified in the LO sample, whereas Coleoptera and insect larvae represented 58% of the prey items of LL. Frogs were not frequent in the diet of either species but, in volume, represented the second most important category for LO and the first for LL. LO showed a larger trophic niche breadth than LL. The trophic niche overlap between the two species was 68.3% for percentage of prey items. The present work confirms the relative importance of frogs in the diet of both species. The greater capacity of LL in moving far away from permanent water bodies may generate better opportunities for prey selection and a narrower trophic niche breadth. The large range of prey used by these two species indicates they are generalist/opportunistic feeders.
