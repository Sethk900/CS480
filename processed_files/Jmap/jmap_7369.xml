Observaciones sobre el Zooplancton de algunos lagos de la Patagonia extrandina. I Rot√≠ferosAbstract The presence of 10 species of Rotatoria from four lakes of Patagonian Tableland, Argentina (Bianca, Colhue‚ÄHuapi, Munster and Cardiel), is communicated. The species recorded are the following: Asplachna brightwelli Gosse, Brachionus caudatus Barrois & Daday, B. plicatilis O. F. Muller; B. kultrum n. sp.; Filinia longiseta limnetica (Zacharias); Keratella kostei n. sp.; K. thomassoni Hauer; K. tropica (Apstein), Notholca sp. and Pompholix sulcata Hudson. The specimens found are described and illustrated. K. thomassoni is a new record for the Argentine fauna. K. kostei might be initially confused with K. quadrata or K. testudo, but it is distinguished from all other species of the genus by the combination of characters as follows: antero‚Älateral spines are longer than the medians and anterointermediates; posterior margin of lorica with a double rim; with two posterior spines; posterior width of body greater than anterior width. Brachionus kultrum n. sp. is more closely associated with B. urceolaris rubens and B. sessilis, but it is distinguished from them by the shape of the very wide foot opening and from species, B. kultrum might be attached to specimens of Daphnia. As far as it is known, K. kostei and B. kultrum have a localized distribution, perhaps restricted to Patagonian tableland lakes.
