Applicability of the 3 Fractional Factorial Design in Determining the Effects of Cultivation Factors on Hulless OatThe objective of this study was to determine the effects of five cultivation factors (sowing date, seeding rate, N fertilization, Mg fertilization, and disease control), applied at three levels of intensity, on the grain yield and 1000-grain weight of hulless spring oat (Avena sativa var. nuda L.) under variable weather conditions with the use of the 35â€“2 fractional factorial Resolution III design. In a 3-yr field experiment, Polar hulless oat was grown on a gray-brown podsolic soil in northeastern Poland. In the group of five analyzed production factors, the fixed effect of N fertilization and sowing rate had the greatest influence on oat yield. The effect of seeding date was also significant, subject to the random effect of weather conditions. The testing was initiated with a Resolution III design because it was relatively small in size and provides some preliminary information about possibly significant factors.
