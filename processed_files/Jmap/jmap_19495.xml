Temporal and spatial variability and controls of soil respiration in a temperate steppe in northern ChinaIn this study, soil respiration and environmental variables were examined to explore the temporal and spatial variability and controls of soil respiration in eight plant communities along an east-west transect in a temperate steppe of Inner Mongolia, China. Our results show that there was substantial temporal (coefficient of variation (CV) = 58.6 +/- 1.54%, n = 14) and spatial variability (CV = 32.6 +/- 2.65%, n = 8) in soil respiration. Soil temperature and moisture were more important than plant growth in controlling the seasonal patterns of within-site soil respiration in all the eight steppe communities. Spatial differences in soil respiration rate could be mainly attributed to the differences in soil moisture and net primary productivity (NPP) among the study sites, whereas soil temperature played a minor role in regulating the spatial pattern of soil respiration. Significantly, positive site-to-site correlations were found between soil respiration and site soil traits such as soil C, N, and clay contents. In contrast, soil respiration was negatively correlated with soil bulk density and sand content. These findings indicate that the relative importance of abiotic and biotic factors in regulating soil respiration differs temporally from spatially. The conclusions drawn from the present study provide valuable information for developing future models of soil respiration driven by site climatic and soil variables, applicable for large-scale estimates of soil respiration in grassland ecosystems.
