Sahel Atlas of Changing Landscapes: Tracing trends and variations in vegetation cover and soil conditionThis atlas aims to illustrate a rigorous scientific basis for understanding processes of landscape change in the Sahel and describes landscapes, climate, vegetation, and trends in vegetation and soil health.  The atlas provides a pictorial overview of the application of land degradation surveillance a science-based approach to land health monitoring and assessment. Systematic sampling and observation of ground conditions are combined with new technology for rapid soil characterization and with fine to moderate resolution satellite imagery to provide powerful inference about soil, vegetation and socioeconomic conditions at local to regional scales.
