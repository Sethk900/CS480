Water allocation, climate change, and sustainable water use in Israel/Palestine: the Palestinian positionThis study examines impacts of population growth and climate change on water supplies of Israelis and Palestinians under business-as-usual conditions and application of the Palestinian Water Authority position on water resources division. Eight scenarios are developed that describe conditions in 2000 and 2025. Several indicators are used to measure the effects of these conditions. The indicators show that population growth and climate change will create international inequities and environmental inadequacies under business-as-usual conditions. Although conditions are more equitable and sustainable with application of the Palestinian position, serious environmental problems will persist â€“ likely exacerbated by the potential impacts of climate change.
