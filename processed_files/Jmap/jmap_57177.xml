Framework to Determine the Optimal Spatial Location and Number of Municipal Solid Waste Bins in a Developing World Urban NeighborhoodAbstractDetermining the optimal location and quantity of waste bins for the collection of municipal solid wastes is challenging because it influences service coverage and public satisfaction, and is often influenced by economic and environmental constraints. This study develops a framework that applies a geographic information system for siting municipal waste bins and determines the optimum quantity of waste bins using an analytic hierarchy process. The framework was applied to a neighborhood in a developing world city (Ilorin, Nigeria). The spatial performance of specific quantities of waste bins was evaluated for social, economic, and environmental effects, as determined from p-median solutions using field-collected solid waste generation data and operational data for the collection vehicles. For the study site, the most optimal solution is five waste bins whose spatial location utilized their capacities and produced less comparative negative effects. The result represents a starting point for extension to larger urban areas by considering the smallest basic unit for spatial and multicriteria analysis. The approach is promising for improvement of municipal solid waste management in developing world cities.
