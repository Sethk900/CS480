New eco-morphological-behavioural approach of the chinchilla rats in the pre-Andean foothills of the Monte Desert (Argentina)This study characterizes the ecology, behaviour and morphology of populations of Abrocoma schistacea and A. uspallata in north-western Argentina. We carried out live-trapping, tagging and recapture during 2006–2008. Burrow structure and vegetation were described. Diet composition and the activity of chinchilla rats were defined. Both species inhabit rock crevices in the pre-Andean foothills of the Monte Desert. Some of their morphological specializations for saxicolous life, such as foot pads for better traction on rocky surfaces and reduced nails, are convergent with those of other saxicolous species. Both species appear to be diurnal, with activity peaking in the early morning. Dietary analyses suggest trophic specialization by both species. Density of A. schistacea was of 0.15 ± 0.06 individuals ha−1; with individuals living in groups of 3–4 animals. Given their low abundance, restricted distribution and high level of habitat and food specialization, we urge that populations of this species be protected through effective management.
