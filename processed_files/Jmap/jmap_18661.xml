BIOLOGICAL-ACTIVITY AND ORGANIC-MATTER TRANSFORMATIONS IN TYPICAL SOILS OF SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEINThe biological activity in a loamy Luvisol and a sandy Podzol was characterized in the field in Schleswig Holstein under forest as well as under conventional and ecological farming by measuring soil respiration and cellulose decomposition. These activities were influenced considerably by the thermal, water, air and nitrogen supply. The decomposition of litter in the Podzol under spruce, which is dependent on nutrients, is low. In the Luvisol under beech, however, it is moderate and counter-measures against soil degradation are necessary. Organic fertilizing increases biological activity in agricultural soils, independent of the farming method. A good nutrient supply (N, Ca) in the soil solution of the agricultural soils due to fertilizing caused an increase in the biological activity relative to forest soils.
