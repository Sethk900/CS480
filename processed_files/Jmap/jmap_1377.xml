Experimental Restoration of an Indigenous Hawaiian Grassland after Invasion by Buffel Grass (Cenchrus ciliaris).Introduced grasses have displaced Hawaiian Pili grass (<em>Heteropogon contortus</em>) in most dry, leeward habitats of the Hawaiian Islands. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of restoring an indigenous <em>Heteropogon</em> grassland at the Puukohola Heiau National Historic Site, where introduced Buffel grass (<em>Cenchrus ciliaris</em>) is now dominant. <em>Heteropogon</em> seeds (50 seedlings/m<sup>2</sup>) were added to replicate plots within a <em>Cenchrus</em> grassland. Some plots were subjected to one-time herbicide or hand-pulling treatments to remove established <em>Cenchrus</em>. Because Hawaiians historically used fire to promote <em>Heteropogon</em> grasslands, the plots were burned biennially. Plots were also subjected to two levels of water supplementation. <em>Heteropogon</em> establishment was monitored over 2 and 4 years in the higher- and lower-water plots, respectively. In treatments containing established <em>Cenchrus</em>, <em>Heteropogon</em> establishment was consistently poor (<10% cover). But in the burned plots where established <em>Cenchrus</em> had been removed, as many as 31 <em>Heteropogon</em> seedlings per square meter were recorded, and <em>Heteropogon</em> became the dominant cover, averaging 34% absolute cover (81% relative cover) after 4 years in the lower-water plot and 34% absolute cover (60% relative cover) after 2 years in the higher-water plot. Few <em>Cenchrus</em> grass seedlings survived, possibly due to insufficient water. Water supplementation promoted growth of other alien grasses from the seed bank (<em>Digitaria insularis</em> and <em>Eragrostis</em> spp.); however, these grasses quickly declined after supplemental watering was terminated. Although initial suppression of <em>Cenchrus</em> was required, <em>Heteropogon</em> expanded quickly when seeds and fire were reintroduced, demonstrating that a <em>Heteropogon</em>-dominated grassland can be reestablished in 2-4 years.
