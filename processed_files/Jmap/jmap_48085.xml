Successful identification of the final instar nymph of Quintilia carinata (Thunberg) (Hemiptera: Cicadidae) by DNA extraction from the exuviumDespite being taxonomically and phylogenetically informative, the morphology of the immature stages of cicadas has received comparatively superficial attention. One reason for this is the difficulty of positively identifying immature stages, particularly as these stages are fossorial. We present a method for identifying cicada exuviae using DNA sequence data and describe a set of characters and character states for the final instar nymph of Quintilia carinata (Thunberg). The identification of immature stages using molecular methods will increase our knowledge of African cicadas, allowing for the initiation of future phylogenetic and ecological comparisons.
