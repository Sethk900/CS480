Irrigation of Residential Landscapes Using the Toro Intelli-Sense Controller in Southwest FloridaAbstractThe objective of the research reported in this paper was to determine the potential water-savings effectiveness of Toro Intelli-Sense evapotranspiration (ET)-based irrigation controllers in single-family homes. Of the 36 cooperators selected, 21 cooperators were outfitted with Toro Intelli-Sense TIS-612 (the ET group) and the remaining 15 were used as comparisons. The ET group reduced irrigation compared to the gross irrigation requirement by 23–41% and the 9-year historical average by 23–34%. Results varied based on the relationship between historical irrigation and the gross irrigation requirement, with water savings of 24%, no difference, and an increase of 54% when the historical value exceeded, approximated, and was less than the gross irrigation requirement, respectively. Turfgrass quality was maintained above an acceptable threshold for both treatments. In southwest Florida, a properly programmed Intelli-Sense controller is recommended when irrigation exceeds the gross irrigation requirement and at least 696 mm of irrigation is applied annually. Other smart-irrigation technologies would be more appropriate in locations for which the irrigation rate is less than the gross irrigation requirement.
