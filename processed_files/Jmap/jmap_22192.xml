Revision of the Taiwanese millipede genus Chamberlinius Wang, 1956, with descriptions of two new species and a reclassification of the tribe Chamberlinini (Diplopoda, Polydesmida, Paradoxosomatidae, Paradoxosomatinae)Abstract The millipede genus Chamberlinius is basically confined to Taiwan, with only one of the four known species presumably introduced to southern Japan. Both previously known species are redescribed, based on new material: Chamberlinius hualienensis Wang, 1956 (the type species) and Chamberlinius piceofasciatus (Gressitt, 1941), the latter being a new subjective senior synonym of Chamberlinius shengmui Wang, 1957, syn. n. Two further congeners are described as new: Chamberlinius pessior sp. n. and Chamberlinius sublaevus sp. n. The genus is re-diagnosed, all of its four species are keyed, and their distributions mapped. The tribe Chamberlinini is reclassified and, based on gonopod traits, shown to comprise the following five genera: Chamberlinius Wang, 1956, Haplogonosoma Br√∂lemann, 1916, Riukiupeltis Verhoeff, 1939, Aponedyopus Verhoeff, 1939 and Geniculodesmus Chen, Golovatch and Chang, 2008.
