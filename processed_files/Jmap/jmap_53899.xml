Ammonium fixation by soils saturated with different cationsA laboratory experiment was conducted to study the influence of saturation of specific cations (Ca2+, Na+, Ba2+ and K+) on NH4+ fixation in six soil samples with differing physicochemical and mineralogical characteristics. The study showed that their effects were in the following order: Ba2+ > Na+ > Ca2+ > control > K+. Treatment with K+ apparently removed some NH4+ fixed in the soils prior to sampling. The fixing capacity of the six samples was in the following order: Hoogly > Malda > Haringhata > Canning > Coochbihar > Jalpaiguri. The fixing behaviour was found to parallel the amount of clay present except in one sample.
