Complementary explanation of temperature response in the lower atmosphereThere are a number of asymmetries in the surface air temperature response to forcing, including polar amplification and changes to the diurnal and seasonal temperature ranges. We propose that such spatialâ€“temporal signatures of climate change can, in part, be explained by differences in the effective heat capacity of the atmosphere. We have demonstrated that predictions arising from this hypothesis are simultaneously satisfied through the analysis of temperature records from daily to inter-decadal timescales using observational and reanalysis datasets. This mechanism can help to explain why we see the largest temperature trends in the winter months (0.42 K/decade in winter compared to 0.18 K/decade in summer) and why the diurnal temperature range decreases in a warming world, having decreased by ~0.4 K since 1950.
