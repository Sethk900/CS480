Morphometric and molecular variation in mountain catfishes (Amphiliidae: Amphilius) in Guinea, West AfricaSpecies of the genus Amphilius are small benthic catfishes that occur throughout tropical Africa and are abundant in the mountain streams of the Fouta Djalon region in Guinea, West Africa. During a 2003 expedition to the area, numerous amphiliid catfish were collected and initial observations revealed a large amount of morphological variation across the sampled basins. These specimens were subjected to a geometric morphometric analysis and standard morphometric analysis. Cytochrome b gene sequences were also obtained and compared among populations. These analyses resulted in the discovery of multiple cryptic taxa within two recognized species, Amphilius platychir and Amphilius rheophilus. The discovery of these taxa is compared with other recent discoveries from the area.
