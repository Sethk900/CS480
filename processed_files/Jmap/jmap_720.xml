Morphological and reproductive response of Caragana microphylla to different stocking rates.Understanding the effect on host plants of defending against herbivores is important in grazing ecology and grassland management. In this study, the morphological and reproductive responses of Caragana microphylla Lam. to grazing sheep were investigated using a 15-year grazing experiment with six stocking rates in the Inner Mongolia steppe of China. Plant height, rachis length, leaflet size, and number of pods decreased significantly, whereas spine density and length increased significantly with increased stocking rate. Significant negative correlations were observed between production of vegetative and reproductive organs and defensive organs, indicating that it is costly for C. microphylla to defend against herbivores and that morphological miniaturization and a tradeoff between production and defense were main responses of C. microphylla to herbivores.
