Environmental changes in Lebanon during the Holocene: Man vs. climate impacts.Pollen and archaeological studies were undertaken in the Southern Bekaa Valley (Lebanon, Mediterranean region). Two Holocene records retrieved in the Aammiq and Chamsine/Anjar wetlands, respectively located at the foothills of Mount Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon Mountain, in the Southern Bekaa Valley, were analyzed to highlight climatic vs. anthropogenic influence on landscape patterns. Our data records support hypothesis on climatically driven modification during the Late Glacial Age and the early Holocene. Human disturbances in the study area are only depicted after c. 8 ky cal. BP, with different patterns in eastern and western parts of the Southern Bekaa Valley. These modifications are in line with major landscape changes in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Since c. 8 ky cal. BP, major deforestation events on Mount Lebanon are recorded in the Aammiq area depicting human interference, while in Chamsine/Anjar, no sign of such activities can be interpolated since strong deciduous oak development is recorded. Archaeological records from the same region confirm human impact on the forest during the Neolithic period. Numerous bifacial flint tools, such as axes, adzes, and chisels, manufactured in the prehistoric workshops of the Southern Bekaa Valley, attest to the beginning of the deforestation during this period. From c. 3.5 to c. 2 ky cal. BP, deforestation seems reduced on Mount Lebanon while in the Chamsine/Anjar area oak forest expansion is still recorded. During the same period, grazing activities were performed in the Bekaa Valley.
