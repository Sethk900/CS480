Parisognoriste, a new genus of Lygistorrhinidae (Diptera: Sciaroidea) from the Oise amber with redescription of Palaeognoriste MeunierAbstract A new genus and a new species of Lygistorrhinidae, Parisognoriste eocenica is described from the Eocene Oise amber of the Paris Basin. Parisognoriste sciariforme Meunier, 1904 and Parisognoriste affine Meunier, 1912 are re-described. Lectotypes are designated for both species of Palaeognoriste. The phylogenetic positions of the new genus and Palaeognoriste Meunier are discussed. The paper is an example demonstrating a new approach in cybertaxonomy including automatic generation of manuscript within Virtual Research Environment (Scratchpads), semantic enhancements, and parallel release of the publication on paper and on-line accompanied with registration of new taxa with ZooBank.
