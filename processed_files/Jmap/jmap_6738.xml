Veld compositional response to fertilization in the tall grassveld of NatalThe plant species compositional response of veld at Ukulinga to application, over 30 years, of nitrogen, phosphate and lime is reported. Two types of nitrogen fertilizer were applied at four levels with and without phosphate, lime and lime + phosphate. Each treatment was replicated three times. Data on veld composition were obtained using a Levy bridge and observing 100 points per plot. The response of the veld to fertilization was examined using detrended correspondence analysis, providing simultaneously a samples and species ordination. The amount, but not the form, of nitrogen fertilizer strongly affected veld composition. Phosphate and lime had a lesser effect on veld compositon, but the presence of phosphate enhanced the effect of nitrogen on some grasses. S. Afr. J. Plant Soil 1986, 3: 1â€“10
