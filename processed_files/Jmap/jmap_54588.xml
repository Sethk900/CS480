A new species of sponge inhabiting barnacle Bryozobia (Archaeobalanidae, Bryozobiinae) in the West PacificThis paper describes a new species, Bryozobia rossi sp. n., collected by scuba diving in both Taiwan and Japan. B. rossi sp. n., a member of the subfamily Bryozobiinae (Ross and Newman 1996), has atria and open end portals and a single irregular basal whorl of portals at the same level as basal hemiportals; this morphology varies from all previously described bryozobiines. According to our review of relevant literature, this is the first reported Bryozobia in the Pacific, and this study is the first to describe the morphology of oral cone, cirri, and penis for the genus Bryozobia.
