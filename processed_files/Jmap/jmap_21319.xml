A new species of Fauveliopsidae (Annelida) from the North SeaAbstract A new species of the genus Laubieriopsis Petersen, 2000 is described based on 28 specimens collected in the north-east part of the North Sea. It is characterized by fixed number of chaetigers (22), paired genital papillae, bidentate neurochaeta of chaetigers 1–4, the absence of acicular chaetae on chaetigers 5–21 and, on the last chaetiger, one acicular and three capillary chaetae enlarged and directed backward. The present study brings the number of known species of Laubieriopsis to five and the number of Northeast Atlantic species of this genus to two.
