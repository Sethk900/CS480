Revision of the Chinese species of the genus Belonuchus Nordmann (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae: Philonthina)In this paper, the Chinese species of the genus Belonuchus Nordmann, 1837 are revised. Four new species are described and illustrated: B. admirabilis sp. nov. from China (Beijing), B. applanatus sp. nov. from China (Yunnan), B. coomani sp. nov. from China (Yunnan and Guangxi) and Vietnam (Hoa-Binh) and B. obvelatus sp. nov. from Indonesia (Sumatra and Java). Belonuchus grandiceps (Kraatz, 1859) and B. imitator Cameron, 1932 are reported from China for the first time. Five existing Chinese species are re-described and illustrated: B. grandiceps, B. imitator, B. puncticulus, B. punctifrons and B. rufoniger. Belonuchus gardneri Cameron, 1932 is placed in synonymy with B. rufoniger Fauvel, 1895. Consequently, eight species of the genus Belonuchus are now known from China. An identification key to the Chinese species of the genus Belonuchus is provided and their geographical distribution is mapped.
