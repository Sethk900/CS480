Clay-substrate application to sandy open-cast mine soilsThe review gives some insight into the objective of amelioration to improve fertility of sandy soils. The research concept is based on the high water and cation exchange capacity of clay minerals. Technological and economic problems as well as practicable possibilities of their solution are discussed. Numerous pot and plot vegetation experiments resulted in an average yield increase of 15% and show the effectiveness of clay-substrate application. The amelioration procedure is particularly recommended on open-cast mine sites, where ecological aspects have to be observed.
