Spatial and temporal variations in the strength of loess soils, Lishi, ChinaField monitoring of the strength of loess soils by using the hand-held Pilcon Torvane was conducted at six sites in Wangjiagou in the hilly loess region of North China during August 1985 to September 1986. Temporal variation of soil strength was found to be a response to changing soil moisture content which in turn relates to the occurrence of rainstorms. Plowing of the soil causes very significant reduction in soil strength. Spatial variation of soil strength is related to soil condition. Strength of the compacted and the plowed soil is as low as 33% and 23% respectively of that at the uncultivated site. Soils on flatter slopes have a higher strength but this difference diminishes at high soil moisture contents.
