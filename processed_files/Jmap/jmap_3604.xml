Nest site characteristics of sharp-shinned hawks in Idaho's Frank Church-River of No Return WildernessTopographic and vegetative site characteristics were compared for six sharp-shinned hawk (Accipiter striatus) nests in the Big Creek area of Idaho's Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness. Nesting birds were located by detection of responses to broadcasted sharp-shinned hawk alarm calls. Observed nests were built in live Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) trees within Douglas-fir/ninebark (Physocarpus malvaceus) plant communities. All nest trees were infected by dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium douglasii), a common parasite of Douglas-fir. Nests were commonly located in a tree that was of above-average height or the tallest tree in the stand. All nests were within 50 meters (m) of the stand edge. In addition, riparian vegetation was found within approzimately 20 m of four of the six nests.
