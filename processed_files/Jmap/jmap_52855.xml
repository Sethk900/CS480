First records of the jewel beetles Chrysobothris desmaresti (Laporte &amp; Gory, 1836) and Hiperantha stempelmanni Berg, 1889 (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) in BoliviaThe jewel beetle species Chrysobothris desmaresti (Laporte & Gory, 1836) and Hiperantha stempelmanni Berg, 1889, have been recorded in Bolivia for the first time. Both species were collected on xeric Acacia trees. As indicated by their presence on Acacia and previous records, both species may be endemic to the arid intermountain valleys of the Southern Bolivian and Northern Argentinean Andes as well as the Chaco lowland forests.
