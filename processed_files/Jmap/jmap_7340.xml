Ecolog√≠a trofica de dos estrellas de mar del genero Astropecten coexistentes en Golfo Triste, VenezuelaAbstract Trophic ecology of two co‚Äexisting sea stars of the genus Astropecten in the Golfo Triste, Venezuela Monthly trawl samples taken from commercial fishing boats were used to analyze the stomach contents of 981 specimens of Astropecten riensis and 499 A. cf. articulatus. These two star‚Äfish, like other species in the genus, feed selectively; their primary prey are mollusks, of which gastropods are more frequently eaten than pelecypods. The main food item in the diet of A. riensis is the gastropod Finella dubia (50% of the diet). A. cf. articulates feeds frequently (26.5% of the diet) on another gastropod, Olivella (Minioliva) mirmeco√∂n. A. riensis and A. cf. articulatus have slightly overlapping trophic niches. However, other factors may reduce interspecific competition for food, such as specialization for certain prey sizes or consuming similar prey but in distinct proportions. Other niches differences may occur in their activity patterns and microhabitat.
