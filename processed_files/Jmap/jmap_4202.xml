Taxonomy and biology of the mealybug genus Plotococcus Miller & Denno (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) in Brazil, with descriptions of two new speciesTwo new species of Brazilian mealybugs, Plotococcus capixaba Kondo sp. n. and Plotococcus hambletoni Kondo sp. n. (Pseudococcidae), are described and illustrated. Plotococcus capixaba is a newly recognized pest from the leaves of the jaboticaba tree, Myrciaria jaboticaba (Vell.) O. Berg (Myrtaceae), from Espirito Santo and from Leandra erinacea Cogn. (Melastomataceae) from Sao Paulo. Plotococcus hambletoni was collected in Sao Paulo on a myrtaceous plant. A revised key to the species of Plotococcus Miller & Denno, and a key to the different growth stages of P. capixaba are provided. All female instars are described for P. capixaba, but only the adult female is known for P. hambletoni. The biology of Plotococcus is discussed, with emphasis on P. capixaba.
