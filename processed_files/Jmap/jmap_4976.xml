Mamilloecia indica (Halocyprididae: Ostracoda) a new genus and species from the Northwest Indian OceanA stratified zooplankton sample series taken from the upwelling region of the Gulf of Oman during February 1997 was analysed. Samples collected from below 1500 m contained an abundant species that closely resembled Paraconchoecia mamillata MÃ¼ller, 1906 found in the Atlantic. Morphological and statistical analysis showed that the Oman species differed significantly from P. mamillata. In addition, both species differed significantly from Paraconchoecia spinifera, the type species of the genus Paraconchoecia. A new genus is erected to accommodate both the Oman and Atlantic species, together with the closely related Paraconchoecia nanomamillata Deevey and Brooks, 1980. Comprehensive redescriptions of P. spinifera and Mamilloecia mamillata new combination are given along with full descriptions of the new genus and species Mamilloecia indica.
