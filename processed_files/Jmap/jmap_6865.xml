Seasonal changes in bird assemblages of coastal woodlands in east-central ArgentinaWe studied seasonal variation in bird assemblages during two years in the coastal woodlands of the reserve, 'El Destino', Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. Higher bird density was recorded during spring, and lower one during autumn, but species richness did not show changes during the annual cycle. Seasonal variation in abundance and species composition was recorded for the frugivore-insectivore and the granivore guilds, however, not for the insectivores. As winter is not harsh, insectivorous species might not be faced with food shortage. In contrast, the abundance of frugivorous-insectivorous and granivorous species appeared to be related with fluctuations in their food resources.
