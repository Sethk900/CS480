Losses Reduction and Energy Production in Water-Distribution NetworksAbstractDuring the past few years, issues concerning sustainable management of water distribution systems have attracted interest through an integrated policy aimed at reducing leakage through a pressure management strategy. Pressure reducing valves (PRVs) are often used in water networks to prevent the downstream hydraulic grade from exceeding a set value, although they must be adequately located to maximize their effectiveness. In recent years, the application of turbines or pumps operating as turbines (PATs) appeared as an alternative and sustainable solution to control network pressure and produce energy. In the present paper, PRVs and PATs were used within a district in a Naplesâ€™ water distribution network and showed large potential revenues and an attractive capital payback period.
