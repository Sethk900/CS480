A unique seasonal cycle in a leaf gall-inducing insect: the formation of stem galls for dormancyThe mechanisms by which gall‚Äinducing insects cope with variation in their host plant phenology are poorly known. Pseudotectococcus rolliniae Hodgson and Gon√ßalves (Hemiptera: Eriococcidae) induces leaf galls in Rollinia laurifolia Schltdl. (Annonaceae), which loses its leaves during the dry season. The fate of the gall‚Äinducing stage during that season was determined by sampling a natural population of P. rolliniae during 3 years. Morphometric comparison among different larval instars and morphological descriptions of plant and gall features were performed. Crawlers leave the galls before leaf fall and move to the stems, where they induce a second gall morphotype and undergo dormancy throughout the dry season. They moult when the vernal rains begin, move to sprouting leaves and induce leaf galls, as second‚Äinstar nymphs, not as crawlers as is usual for Eriococcidae. This is the first report of an insect gall induced for dormancy, which is likely to be a true diapause phenomenon.
