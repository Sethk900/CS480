Note on the distribution and migration of the Blackcapped Vireo (Vireo atricapilla)Little is known about the migration of the Black-capped Vireo (Vireo atricapilla). In this short communication we report a sight-record of an adult male Black-capped Vireo in northeastern Michoac√°n and several distribution records outside the proposed distribution for this species. Altogether, these records suggest that the species uses the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Transvolcanic Mexican Belt for migration.
