Near-global validation of the SRTM DEM using satellite radar altimetryThis paper reports the results of a near-global validation of the SRTM DEM dataset, using a unique database of completely independent height measurements derived from satellite altimeter echoes, primarily gathered by ERS-1. These heights are obtained using a rule-based expert system which identifies each echo as 1 of 11 different characteristic shapes, and selects the optimal retracking algorithm to obtain best range to surface. The results of this comparison, which includes over 54 million altimeter derived heights, show generally very good agreement with the SRTM data, with global statistics for mean difference of 3Â m and a standard deviation of 16Â m. Quantitative validation results are given for each continent and are summarised here.Mean difference (m)Standard deviation of differences (m)Africa1.8615.62Australia1.0911.49Eurasia2.5416.09North America3.1515.18South America12.2218.51Global3.6016.16A range of examples are included to illustrate key findings of this work and to indicate synergistic applications of these two datasets currently being studied including the potential for forest canopy measurement.
