Automatic Generation of Digital Surface Models Through Matching in Object SpaceA system for the automatic reconstruction of a three dimensional terrain surface is presented. Matching is performed in object space, so that an arbitrary number of overlapping images, with a minimum of two, can be used. Image pyramids are used to decrease the search space. The similarity measure is the correlation coefficient. In order to take perspective differences into account, the images are resampled after each pyramid level, using the latest available surface model. The resampling method that is used comprises the differential rectification procedure for orthophotograph generation. Thus orthophotographs are automatically generated, simultaneously with the surface reconstruction. All pixels in the orthophotograph are matched. In order to make the result more robust, that is to reduce or eliminate the effects of gross errors, the matched points are filtered in two steps. The resolution of the digital surface model can be reduced by estimating a sparser grid of heights through a least squares adjustment of finite elements. Some test results are presented.
