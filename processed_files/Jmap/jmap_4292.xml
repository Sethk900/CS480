Tail loss in the Syntopic Lizards Tropidurus itambere (Tropiduridae) and Mabuya frenata (Scincidae) in Southeastern BrazilTail autotomy rates were assessed for two syntopic lizards (Tropidurus itambere, Tropiduridae and Mabuya frenata, Scincidae) in Valinhos, SÃ£o Paulo state, Brazil. Tail-break frequencies did not differ significantly between sexes in either species, though female T. itambere and male M. frenata generally had higher frequencies within a given size range. M. frenata had a considerably higher frequency of tail autotomy (82.4%; N = 216) than T. itambere (23.0%; N = 547), which we believe to be mainly due to phylogenetic differences in ease of tail shedding between the two genera. We also compare our results with data for several other cisandean South American lizards.
