Trends in extreme daily precipitation and temperature near lake Hövsgöl, MongoliaA long-term (1963–2002) set of daily maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation data are analyzed for the H¨ovsg¨ol Basin area, Mongolia. Six indices of extreme temperature and eight indices of extreme precipitation are examined. Results suggest that climate conditions over northern Mongolia are changing as indicated by a warming trend identified during the study period. Significant increases are detected in the annual number of hot days and warm nights in this region. Associated with these changes are concomitant decreases in the annual number of cold days and cold nights. The number of days with precipitation has increased slightly while the annual total precipitation has not significantly increased in northern Mongolia.
