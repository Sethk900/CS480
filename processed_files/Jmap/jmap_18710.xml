Interactive effects of wheel-traffic and tillage system on soil carbon and nitrogenWheel-traffic induced soil compaction has been shown to limit crop productivity, and its interaction with tillage method could affect soil nutrient transformations. A study was conducted during 1993-1994 to determine interactive effects of tillage method (conventional tillage and no-tillage) and wheel-traffic (traffic and no traffic) on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) at a long-term (initiated 1987) research site at Shorter, Alabama. The cropping system at this study site is a corn (Zea mays L.) - soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr] rotation with crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) as a winter cover crop. Soil organic C, total N, and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) were not significantly affected by six years of traffic and tillage treatments. However, conventional tillage compared to no-tillage almost doubled the amount of CO2-C respired over the entire observation period and during April 1994 field operations. Soil respiration was stimulated immediately after application of wheel-traffic, but nontrafficked soils produced greater amounts of CO2-C compared to trafficked soils during other periods of observation. Nitrogen mineralization was significantly lower from no-tillage-trafficked soils compared to conventional tillage-trafficked and no-tillage-nontrafficked foils far the 1993 growing season. A laboratory incubation indicated the presence of relatively easily mineralizable N substrates from conventional tillage-trafficked sail compared to conventional tillage-nontrafficked and no-till-trafficked soils. For the coarse textured soil used in this study it appears that conventional tillage in combination with wheel-traffic may promote the highest levels of soil microbial activity.
