Quantifying concentrated-flow erosion on cropland with aerial photogrammetryDifficulties in quantifying the amount of soil lost to concentrated-flow erosion on tilled agricultural land have inhibited development of predictive models. However, current experimental studies indicate that modern photogrammetric techniques applied to sequential, large-scale aerial photographs keyed to the cropping cycle can be used reliably to determine the volume of soil lost to concentrated-flow erosion. This methodology will allow scientists to study erosional processes and establish data bases for model development and validation.
