The role of insect damage in the colonization of groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) pods by fungiThe incidence of fungal infection in insect-damaged and healthy pods and the resultant colonization of kernels was determined from commercial fields at four localities over a period of two seasons. Based on number of colonies per 100 plates, the order of incidence indicated that Fusarium spp. was the dominant group, followed by Penicillium spp. and Aspergillus niger. Insect damage predisposed kernels to colonization by the Aspergillus group, Fusarium spp., Sclerotium rolfsii and Penicillium spp., but not by Macrophomina phaseolina and Rhizopus spp. Since all the fungi found on kernels also occurred on healthy shells, it appears that insects do not act as vectors of disease, but insect damage enhances fungal colonization of the kernels.
