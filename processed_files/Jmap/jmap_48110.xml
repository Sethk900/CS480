Bounding Box*Relationships between helminth communities and diet in Canarian lizards: the evidence from Gallotia atlantica (Squamata: Lacertidae)Diet and helminth fauna were analysed in the lizard Gallotia atlantica (Squamata: Lacertidae), the smallest species of this genus endemic to Lanzarote and Fuerteventura (Canary Islands), in an attempt to confirm previous claims of relationships between these ecological traits in this genus. A total of 70 lizards belonging to the subspecies atlantica (central southern Lanzarote), laurae (northern Lanzarote) and mahoratae (Fuerteventura) were examined. Compared with other Gallotia, the helminth fauna was impoverished, particularly in Fuerteventura, where the absence of larval cestodes suggests low predation pressure. Diet was omnivorous, the plant fraction (73.03â€“84.26%) included seeds and fruits while the animal fraction was quite diverse, at least in Lanzarote. Contrary to other Gallotia, the intestinal Pharyngodonidae nematodes were all typical of carnivorous reptiles. An individual association between the complexities of helminth communities and diet reinforces previous findings in other Gallotia species suggesting functional relationships between parasites and prey items inside the digestive tract.
