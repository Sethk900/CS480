Immature Stages and Hosts of Two Plesiomorphic, Antillean Genera of Membracidae (Hemiptera) and aÂ new species of Antillotolania from Puerto RicoAbstract The nymphs of Antillotolania Ramos and Deiroderes Ramos are described for the first time, along with the first host record for the genus Antillotolania, represented by Antillotolania myricae, sp. n. Nymphal features of both genera, such as a ventrally fused, cylindrical tergum IX (anal tube), the presence of abdominal lamellae, and heads with foliaceous ventrolateral lobes confirm their placement in Membracidae and are consistent with phylogenetic analyses placing them in Stegaspidinae but in conflict with a cladistic analysis showing a closer relationship to Nicomiinae. Head processes and emarginate forewing pads in the last instars of both genera support an earlier estimate, based on nuclear genes, that the two genera form a monophyletic group in Stegaspidinae. Distinguishing features of the four species of Antillotolania are tabulated.
