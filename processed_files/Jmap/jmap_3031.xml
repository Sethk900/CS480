Sonoran Desert Winter Annuals Affected by Density of Red Brome and Soil NitrogenRed brome [Bromus madritensis subsp. rubens (L.) Husn.] is a Mediterranean winter annual grass that has invaded Southwestern USA deserts. This study evaluated interactions among 13 Sonoran Desert annual species at four densities of red brome from 0 to the equivalent of 1200 plants m(-2). We examined these interactions at low (3 mug) and high (537 mug NO(3)(-) g soil(-1)) nitrogen (N) to evaluate the relative effects of soil N level On survival and growth of native annuals and red brome. Red brome did not affect. emergence or survival of native annuals, but significantly reduced growth of natives, raising concerns about effects of this exotic grass on the fecundity of these species. Differences in growth of red brome and of the three dominant non nitrogen-fixing native annuals at the two levels of soil N were similar. Total species biomass of red brome was reduced by 83% at low, compared to high, N levels, whereas that of the three native species was reduced by from 42 to 95%. Mean individual biomass of red brome was reduced by 87% at low, compared to high, N levels, whereas that of the three native species vas reduced by from 72 to 89%.
