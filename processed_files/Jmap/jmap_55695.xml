Spatio–temporal variability of microbial biomass content and activities related to some physicochemical properties of LuvisolsThe spatio–temporal variability of soil microbial biomass content (microbial biomass carbon — MBC and nitrogen — MBN) and activity (dehydrogenase — DH, and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis — FDAH, soil basal respiration — BR3) and their relationship to the variability of some physicochemical properties at the surface horizon of field soil were studied. Soil samples were collected at 50 points from the upper 20 cm of Luvisols in April and August 2007. Both enzyme activities and soil respiration level revealed significantly higher values in April than in August, while microbial biomass C and N did not significantly differ between both sampling months. Enzyme activities in August and basal respiration measured on both sampling dates showed significant spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I). To characterize the spatial variability of the properties spatially autocorrelated, linear or mixed (spherical/linear) models with (DH, FDAH) or without the nugget effect (BR3), were fitted to the calculated semivariograms. Dehydrogenase activity in August was in the strong variability class (the nugget effect < 25%), while FDAH activity in August was situated in the moderate variability class (the nugget effect between 25 and 75%). The ranges of influence calculated for microbiological properties data ranged from 9.9 to 14.9 m. Kriged maps drawn based on the selected variogram models showed that the microbial properties studied were irregularly distributed in the soil surface and their spatial distribution varied between April and August. No significant correlation was found between enzyme activities and MBC and MBN content. The highest positive correlation coefficients were shown between MBN and MBC as well as between organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) content.
