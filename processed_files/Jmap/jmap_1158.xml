Influence of Fire on Black-tailed Prairie Dog Colony Expansion in Shortgrass Steppe.Factors influencing the distribution and abundance of black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies are of interest to rangeland managers because of the significant influence prairie dogs can exert on both livestock and biodiversity. We examined the influence of 4 prescribed burns and one wildfire on the rate and direction of prairie dog colony expansion in shortgrass steppe of southeastern Colorado. Our study was conducted during 2 years with below-average precipitation, when prairie dog colonies were expanding throughout the study area. Under these dry conditions, the rate of black-tailed prairie dog colony expansion into burned grassland (X ¯ = 2.6 ha/100-m perimeter/y; range = 0.8-5.9 ha/100-m perimeter/y; N = 5 colonies) was marginally greater than the expansion rate into unburned grassland (X ¯ = 1.3ha/100-m perimeter/y; range = 0.2-4.9 ha/100-m perimeter/y; N = 23 colonies; P = 0.066). For 3 colonies that were burned on only a porti...
