Foraging Behavior in the Arboreal Boid Corallus grenadensisCorallus grenadensis is an arboreal boa endemic to the Grenada Bank. Thirty-five encounters with boas resulted in 17.65 hours of observations, including 6.3 hours of video-tape (which included two acts of predation). Boas under 100 cm are largely active foragers that move slowly through bushes and trees and tongue-flick leaf and branch surfaces apparently seeking chemosensory evidence of nocturnally quiescent lizard (Anolis) prey. Significantly more search time was directed to branches below the snake rather than to either the branches supporting the snake or to those above the snake, and tongue-flick rates were significantly higher for moving snakes than for those that were stationary. Smaller snakes prey on nocturnally quiescent lizards and they spent more time moving than did large snakes that feed on nocturnally active rodents and often employ an ambush foraging strategy. Once visual and, presumably, thermal information was received from a sleeping anole, C. grenadensis adopted a lengthy stalking process devoid of tongue-flicks. Snakes approached inactive lizards from adjacent branches with great stealth, moving at a rate of about 1 cm/min. The strike was made from close range (within 3 cm), and the prey was never released once contact was made. We conclude that, if chemosensory cues successfully lead a treeboa to a visual encounter with a sleeping lizard, subsequent behavior ensures a high rate of predation success.
