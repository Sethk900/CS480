Effect of BP1, BP3 and Quince A rootstocks, at three planting densities, on precocity and fruit quality of ‘Forelle’ pear (Pyrus communis L.)‘Forelle’ pear trees (Pyrus communis L.) were established at the Bien Donné experimental farm in the Western Cape Province of South Africa on BP1, BP3 and Quince A rootstocks at three planting densities, i.e., 889, 1667 and 2857 trees. ha −1, to determine the rootstock and planting density effect on precocity and fruit quality. Production per tree and per hectare, tree size and yield efficiency were measured for the first three crops. Fruit quality was determined by mass, colour, firmness and TSS values. Quince A was more productive than the BP-rootstocks and also resulted in smaller trees, thus higher yield efficiency. Higher planting densities resulted in higher production per hectare and higher yield efficiencies for all three rootstocks. Quince A at a planting density of 2857 trees. ha −1 resulted in a cumulative production of 69.7 t.ha−1 from the fourth to the sixth leaf. BP3 was more productive than BP1, while the tree size was similar. This resulted in BP3 having higher yield efficiency than BP1. Quince A significantly increased fruit mass, blush development and total soluble solids compared to the BP-rootstocks.
