Eight species are treated, three new species are described, i.e. Euagathis breviantennata sp. n., E. setosimaculata sp. n. and E. pallitarsis sp. n.

Euagathis guangxiensis (Chen & Yang, 2006) is a new combination. Lectotypes are designated for Disophrys sogdiana Fahringer, 1937, and D. chinensis Fahringer, 1937. A dichotomous illustrated key to species is presented; links to electronic interactive keys and to distribution maps are also included.
