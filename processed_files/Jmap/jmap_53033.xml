A new species of Paracreptotrema (Digenea, Plagiorchiformes, Allocreadiidae) infecting two species of poeciliids in RÃ­o Malila of the RÃ­o PÃ¡nuco basin, Hidalgo, MÃ©xico, with a key to the species of the genusParacreptotrema rosenthali sp. n. was discovered in the intestine of Xiphophorus malinche and Pseudoxiphophorus jonesii, collected from the headwaters of RiÌo Malila, tributary of RÃ­o Conzintla, in the RÃ­o PÃ¡nuco basin, Hidalgo, MÃ©xico, during 2008â€“2009. The new species differs from the five known species of Paracreptotrema Choudhury, PÃ©rez-Ponce de LeÃ³n, Brooks & Daverdin, 2006 by having vitelline follicles that extend from a level anterior to the pharynx to mid-testes, the seminal vesicle which is more extensively folded, and a wider cirrus sac. The new species resembles P. heterandriae in the length of its ceca, which surpasses the posterior margin of the ovary but do not reach the testes. A key to the species of Paracreptotrema is provided.
