Occupational paths towards commercial agriculture: The key roles of farm pluriactivity and the commonsIn South Africa, â€œblackâ€ and â€œcolouredâ€ farmers engaged in several occupational activities are often considered as being â€œnot interested in farmingâ€ or â€œnot seriousâ€. However, in Namaqualand the large majority of â€œcolouredâ€ farmers and especially the most successful ones are pluriactive and have off-farm incomes. Investigations were therefore carried out in that region to better understand the role of pluriactivity. Observations focus on middle-income households from the mining sector entering into small-scale commercial farming. Based on surveys in both non-farm and farm sectors, the results show that, for many households, access to sufficient farm assets depends strongly on the employment situation of the sector of origin and requires a level of investment which can be reached only progressively. This obliges these households to rely on off-farm incomes and communal land at least during the early transitional stage. These results stress the importance of taking into account the diversity of paths and of differentiating the various stages in the transitional period between two occupational activities. Finally, the paper emphasises the importance of taking these specific situations into consideration in the management of the commons.
