A pseudo-waveform technique to assess forest structure using discrete lidar dataThe use of airborne laser scanning systems (lidar) to describe forest structure has increased dramatically since height profiling experiments nearly 30years ago. The analyses in most studies employ a suite of frequency-based metrics calculated from the lidar height data, which are systematically eliminated from a full model using stepwise multiple linear regression. The resulting models often include highly correlated predictors with little physical justification for model formulation. We propose a method to aggregate discrete lidar height and intensity measurements into larger footprints to create Ã¢Â€Âœpseudo-wavesÃ¢Â€Â. Specifically, the returns are first sorted into height bins, sliced into narrow discrete elements, and finally smoothed using a spline function. The resulting Ã¢Â€Âœpseudo-wavesÃ¢Â€Â have many of the same characteristics of traditional waveform lidar data. We compared our method to a traditional frequency-based method to estimate tree height, canopy structure, stem density, and stand biomass in coniferous and deciduous stands in northern Wisconsin (USA). We found that the pseudo-wave approach had strong correlations for nearly all tree measurements including height (cross validated adjusted R2 (R2cv)=0.82, RMSEcv=2.09m), mean stem diameter (R2cv=0.64, RMSEcv=6.15cm), total aboveground biomass (R2cv=0.74, RMSEcv=74.03kghaÃ¢ÂˆÂ’1), and canopy coverage (R2cv=0.79, RMSEcv=5%). Moreover, the type of wave (derived from height and intensity or from height alone) had little effect on model formulation and fit. When wave-based and frequency-based models were compared, fit and mean square error were comparable, leading us to conclude that the pseudo-wave approach is a viable alternative because it has 1) an increased breadth of available metrics; 2) the potential to establish new meaningful metrics that capture unique patterns within the waves; 3) the ability to explain metric selection based on the physical structure of forests; and 4) lower correlation among independent variables.
