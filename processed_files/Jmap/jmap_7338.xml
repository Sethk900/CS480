Semitapiscis squamoralevis sp. nov. (Osteichthyes: Curimatidae), con consideraciones sobre el g√©neroAbstract Semitapiscis squamoralevis sp. nov. (Osteichthyes: Curimatidae) with Considerations on the Genus. A morphological description is given of Semitapiscis squamoralevis sp. nov. recorded from the fluvial system of the Paran√° River and River Plate in the Argentine Republic. The maximum and minimum numerical and meristic values belonging to the holotype and 25 paratypes are tabulated. The differences and similarities with the other species of the genera Semitapiscis and Potamo‚Ärrhina pristigaster are considered. They are the only species of Curimatidae known with more than 85 scales in the lateral line. A key for their identification is given. The validity of Gasterotomus Eig., 1910 and Suprasinelepichthys Fern√°ndez Y√©pez, 1948 is discussed.
