The influence of exogenous gibberellic acid treatments on the relative pith length of witloof chicory (Cichorium intybus L.)Two cultivars of witloof chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) were grown in a fertigated sand medium and GA applied at two concentration levels, either as a leaf or a root treatment. The plants were additionally subjected to a chilling treatment, roots subsequently forced in a dark chamber and the relative pith length measured. Very short piths were measured, compared to results obtained on the same varieties in the Netherlands. It is concluded that exogenous GA application did not result in short piths in witloof heads.
