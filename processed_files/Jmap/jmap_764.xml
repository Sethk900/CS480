Seed germination responses of Periploca sepium Bunge, a dominant shrub in the Loess hilly regions of China.Experiments were conducted to determine the effects of temperature, light, osmotic stress, hydration-dehydration regime and stress relief on the seed germination of Periploca sepium Bunge (Chinese silk vine Asclepiadaceae), which is a native shrub in the Loess Plateau of Northwest China. Freshly harvested seeds germinated equally well in both light and darkness. Seeds germinated under all of tested temperature regimes, and much faster when temperature was maintained at 30, 35, and 30/20, 30/25, 35/25, 35/30 °C range, with more than 90% of seeds germinating within 2 days. Moderate osmotic stress did not inhibit germination at any tested temperature. At 30 °C, seed germination was not affected significantly above -0.8 MPa. The hydration-dehydration pretreatment showed none side effects on P. sepium seeds and the seeds germinated more rapidly as soon as optimal water condition was restored. These results show the advantages of P. sepium, which is a competitive and widespread shrub in dry areas, and provide useful information for vegetation restoration in these drought-prone regions.
