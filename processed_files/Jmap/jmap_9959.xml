Evidence for limited larval dispersal in black rockfish ( Sebastes melanops ): implications for population structure and marine-reserve designAlthough dispersal distances of marine larvae influence gene flow and the establishment of population structure, few data on realized dispersal distances exist for marine species. We combined otolith microstructure and micro chemistry of black rockfish (Sebastes melanops) to assess their potential to provide relative estimates of larval dispersal distance. In 2001 and 2002 we measured trace elements at discrete otolith regions, representing the (i) egg/early-larval, (ii) pelagic larval, and (iii) late-larval/early-juvenile periods of fish collected at three locations 120460 km apart. Discriminant-function analyses based on geochemical signatures at each otolith region accurately grouped an average of 85% (jackknife = 67%) and 87% (jackknife = 81%) of the fish to collection location in 2001 and 2002, respectively. Age at collection ranged from 83 to 174 days and parturition dates within each site were spread over a 22- to 66-day period. Therefore, individuals within sites were not released at similar times. A probable explanation of these data is that larvae from different geographic locations did not mix during ontogeny and possibly did not disperse long distances alongshore. Larval dispersal distances may be appreciably shorter, <120 km, than previously assumed based on models of passive dispersal.
