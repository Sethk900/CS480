Farmers' attitudes towards environmental change, particularly global warming, and the adjustment of crop mix and farm managementThere is a consensus amongst most dimatologists that ‘global warming’ will become apparent. Simulation of warming scenarios has demonstrated that there would be impacts on crops already produced in an area, while the possibility may exist for the introduction of new crops into areas previously unsuitable for them. Although the primary impacts of a warmer climate on crops have been studied, there has been little consideration of farmers' attitudes towards the effects of climate change on their farms. The attitudes of farmers/farm managers towards the environment and climate change are examined in this paper, which uses the examples of two crops (vining peas and navy beans) to explore the adaptations farmers may make to climate change. Farmers predict a combination of positive and negative impacts from global warming, but most think that logistical changes will enable them to adapt to climate change, and most would also consider the possibility of introducing new crops such as navy beans.
