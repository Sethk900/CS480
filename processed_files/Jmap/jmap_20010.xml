Investigation of uav systems and flight modes for photogrammetric applicationsUnmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry has been used in a growing number of diverse applications across different scientific disciplines. Early applica- tions of UAVs included cultural heritage and archaeology, mainly for the docu- mentation and modelling of monuments, buildings and landscapes. In this paper, the focus is on the application of UAVs for documenting archaeological excavations. As excavating is a dynamic process and the objects to be acquired can change signifi- cantly within a few hours, UAVs can provide a suitable alternative to traditional measurement methods such as measuring tapes and tachymeters. Nevertheless, the image processing steps have to be automated, as a large number of resulting materials, usually sketches, maps, ortho-images and 3D models, need to be available quickly. In order to accelerate the processing workflow, an interface between the UAV ground control software and various photogrammetric software packages was developed at ETH Zurich, which allows for an efficient management and transfer of orientation, trajectory and sensor data for rapid project set up.
