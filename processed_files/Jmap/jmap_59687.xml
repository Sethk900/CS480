Transport of Nitrate and Chloride in Variably Saturated Porous MediaAbstractIncreasing concern for groundwater pollution with nitrate (NO3–) has motivated the use of solute-transport studies to explore and predict the transport behavior of NO3–. The main objective of this study was to examine the effect of pore-water velocity on nonequilibrium solute-transport parameters in variably saturated homogeneous and layered soil columns. A second objective was to evaluate the effect of solute concentration on nonequilibrium solute-transport parameters in layered soil columns. The study was conducted in 10-cm long columns repacked with air-dried and sieved (Number 10 sieve) sand and loam soils. A 0.1 M calcium nitrate and calcium chloride [CaCl2+Ca(NO3)2] solution was applied to the columns at −0.30  kPa suction to generate Cl– and NO3– breakthrough curves. The CXTFIT program was used to determine the two-region model parameters. Additional experiments were conducted with repacked layered soil columns downscaled from existing soil profile at New Mexico State University experimental station. Layered soil-column experiments were conducted for two solute concentrations of 0.05 and 0.1 M under near-water-saturated conditions. The dispersion coefficient (D), volumetric mobile water content (θm), and retardation factor (R) for both anions increased with increasing pore-water velocity, but the mass-exchange coefficient (ω) was inconsistent in both homogeneous and layered soil columns. Layered soil-column experiments conducted with a solute concentration of 0.1 M had greater R values than those conducted with 0.05 M solution. The NO3– and Cl– exhibited similar transport behavior through homogeneous and layered soil columns under variably water-saturated conditions and displayed the potential of predicting NO3– movement from easily measured Cl– data.
