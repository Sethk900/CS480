Interpretation of Pumping Test with Radial Collector Well Using a Reservoir ModelAbstractThis study proposes a reservoir model for evaluation of aquifer parameters from a long duration pumping test conducted with a radial collector pumping well and nine observation wells in an unconfined aquifer in the Tailan River basin of China. The proposed model, based on the concept of double continuum, was used to conceptualize the pumping test site into conduit and porous reservoirs coupled by a linear flow exchange for simulating flow during the pumping test. The set of model equations developed from the concept were solved by an iterative method. The model-simulated hydraulic heads agree reasonably well with the observation heads in both the pumping and observation wells at an average normalized root mean square error of 10.99 and 8.06%, respectively, during pumping but were weaker in the recovery period. This notwithstanding, the specific yield estimates compare well with the range obtained for a numerical modeling of the entire aquifer basin. Significantly, the model was applied successfully in simulating sustainable withdrawal rates from the aquifer and may be a useful tool for analyzing flows to radial collector wells for applications in water resources management.
