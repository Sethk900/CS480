The generic concept of Allocyclops Kiefer, 1932: (Copepoda: Cyclopoida: Cyclopidae) an alternative viewThe current systematics of the genus Allocyclops Kiefer, 1932 is a contentious subject. The emended diagnosis proposed in 2001 by Karanovic has not been unanimously accepted and the classical outline and species arrangement has been favoured in the latest update by Dussart and Defaye in 2006. Based on re-examination of types and additional material both concepts are tested and rejected because they are unnatural groupings. The redefined genus absorbs Bacillocyclops Lindberg, 1956 within it, and includes the species Allocyclops chappuisi Kiefer, 1932, Allocyclops cavicola Chappuis, 1951, Allocyclops beadlei (Lindberg, 1956) comb. nov. and Allocyclops botosaneanui Plesa, 1981. Psammocyclops Kiefer, 1955 and Stolonicyclops Reid and Spooner, 1998 are re-instated as separate genera: the former including Psammocyclops excellens Kiefer, 1955 and Psammocyclops ritae (Dumont and Lamoot, 1978), the latter including Stolonicyclops heggiensis Reid and Spooner, 1998 only. Hypocyclops gen. nov. is erected to accommodate Hypocyclops kieferi (Petkovski, 1971) comb. nov. and Hypocyclops montenegrinus (Karanovic, 2001) comb. nov. Virbiocyclops gen. nov. is defined for Virbiocyclops silvaticus (Rocha and Bjornberg, 1988) comb. nov. and Olmeccyclops gen. nov. for Olmecyclops veracruzanus (Su√°rez-Morales, Mendoza and Mercado-Salas, 2010) comb. nov. Speocyclops transsaharicus Lamoot, Dumont and Pensaert, 1981 is allocated to the genus Hesperocyclops Herbst, 1984 and Bryocyclops arenicolous (Fryer, 1956) returned to its initial placement in Metacyclops Kiefer 1927. Each of the herein (re)defined genera is representative of a different lineage within Cyclopidae. The status and affinities of Cyclops minutissimus Kiefer, 1933 auct. and Allocyclops (A.) australonipponicus Tomikawa, Ishida and Mawatari, 2005 remain unresolved. They are considered gen. spec. inq.
