Fly parasitism in Papuan frogs, with a discussion of ecological factors influencing evolution of lifeâ€history differencesDipteran parasitism of frogs in the Papuan region is described and aspects of the ecological interaction are detailed. The fly involved, Batrachomyia krausi, is the largest known member of an otherwise Australian genus. Larvae of this species develop in the lateral lymph sacs of frogs of the genus Rana, feed on host blood tissues, occur with high incidence and moderate intensity, yet exhibit minimal virulence. Minimal virulence and high infestation rate seen in this hostâ€“parasite system contrast with those reported for Australian congeners. These differences are hypothesized to derive from interaction of the large size of the Papuan parasite with its phylogenetically constrained lifeâ€history. Differences in virulence exhibited between parasitic chloropids versus calliphorids and sarcophagids are discussed as consistent with ecological predictions based on parasite transmission dynamics.
