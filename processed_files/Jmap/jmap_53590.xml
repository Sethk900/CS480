A review of the scopelocheirid amphipods (Crustacea, Amphipoda, Lysianassoidea), with the description of new taxa from Australian watersScopelocheiridae is a small family of scavenging lysianassoid amphipods. There is a distinct shallow water group (Scopelocheirinae subfam. n.) and a distinct deep-sea group (Paracallisominae subfam. n.). We catalogue three genera and eight species in the scopelocheirines and move Scopelocheirus onagawae Takekawa & Ishimaru, 2000 to the genus Aroui. The deep-sea paracallisomines are not often collected and consequently their morphological diversity is not well understood. We catalogue seven genera and 15 species. We provide diagnostic descriptions and a key to all genera in the Scopelocheiridae. We describe two new genera, Austrocallisoma gen. n. and Tayabasa gen. n., and three new species from Australian waters, Austrocallisoma jerryi sp. n., Paracallisoma woolgoolga sp. n. and P. zivianii sp. n.
