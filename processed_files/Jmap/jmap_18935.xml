Changes in net ecosystem production associated with forest fire in Taiga ecosystems, near Yakutsk, RussiaBoreal and Taiga forests in Russia play an important role in carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems. In this region, forest fires often occur, which affect considerably carbon cycling in the Taiga ecosystems. We estimated the net ecosystem production (NEP) in five ecosystems with different histories of forest fire in Yakutsk, Russia. The NEP was calculated as the difference between the net primary production (NPP) and annual soil organic matter decomposition (OMD). Severe burning and forest regeneration strongly affected OMD, NPP, and NEP. The NEP values were +1.24 and +1.40 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) in two intact larch forests. But, the NEP values decreased to -0.89 and +0.07 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) at two sites burned 5 years before. However, NEP showed the highest value, +2.39 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1), in a young larch forest burned 25 years before. The changes in NPP were considered to be a predominant factor for the changes in NEP in this region. Further studies should be carried out to analyze and/or estimate the changes in NPP after forest fire in relation to NEP in this region.
