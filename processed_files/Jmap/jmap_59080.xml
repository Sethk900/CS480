Standardization of Reference Evapotranspiration Models for a Subhumid Valley Rangeland in the Eastern HimalayasAbstractFor efficient irrigation water management and hydro-meteorological studies at both the field and catchment scales, a need exists to evaluate the existing evapotranspiration (ET) estimation methods under varied physiographical and data availability conditions. In this study, using the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith model as the benchmark model, a total of 16 various ET estimation methods were evaluated using both the continuous daily time series and average time series weather data of a subhumid valley cultivated rangeland in the eastern Indian Himalayas. The results revealed that some pan evaporation models have restricted performances. Consequently, for an improved performance, all of these models were standardized using a genetic algorithm–based linear corrector transformation model. Almost all of the models performed reasonably well when using the average daily time series data. Furthermore, the trend analysis of reference ET showed an increasing trend during the months of February to July, including October, and a decreasing trend during August to January, except October, with an annual decreasing rate of 0.42  mm/year.
