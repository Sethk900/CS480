New distributional data on Oxysternon pteroderum Nevinson, 1892 (Scarabaeidae, Scarabaeinae,Phanaeini) and its possible implications in conservationAbstract New distributional data are reported on the rare phanaeine dung beetle, Oxysternon pteroderum Nevinson, 1892, based on five specimens recently collected between 1985 and 2010. Before the present study, Oxysternun pteroderum had been reported solely from the super-moist Atlantic coastal forests of southeastern Brazil. We now believe that the distribution of Oxysternun pteroderum follows the riparian areas of large rivers connected to the super-moist forest ecosystem.
