Description of a new Tetranychus (Acarina, Prostigmata: Tetranychidae) pest of Musa from French GuianaA new species of tetranychid mite, genus Tetranychus Dufour, 1832, is described and illustrated herein from neotropical area. Tetranychus musae sp. nov. (Acari, Prostigmata: Tetranychidae) differs from other species in the genus by the combination between the arrangement of leg setae on females tarsus I and the shape of the aedeagus. Tarsus I bears one tactile setae proximal to proximal duplex setae and three tactiles in line or almost in line with proximal duplex setae. The aedeagus knob consists of an acute posterior projection bent ventrally and a larger anterior rounded projection directed anterodorsally. T. musae specimens were collected in French Guiana where they appeared to be a pest of Musa sp. A key to adults of neotropical species of the genus Tetranychus feeding on banana is provided.
