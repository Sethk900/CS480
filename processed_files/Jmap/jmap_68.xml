An analysis of winter temperature and dew point under the canopy of a common Sonoran Desert nurse and the implications for positive plant interactions.Many studies have focused on positive-plant interactions such as nurse plants, which provide a sheltered subcanopy environment that benefits the nursed species. Most of these studies have focused on plant distribution and association patterns, while the microclimatic benefits are often assumed. This study quantifies 5 a.m. subcanopy temperatures as well as dew points beneath a common nurse tree of the Sonoran Desert, Cercidium microphyllum (palo verde, Fabaceae). Data are collected over 35 days in the winter (January and February) at six locations (at the base of the trunk, midway to the canopy edge, canopy edge, all to the north and to the south of the base of the tree) under each of two trees, as well as a control in the open.
