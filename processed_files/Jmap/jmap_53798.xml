Characterization of mobile aluminium in acid soilsTwo approaches to defining Al status were investigated for a group of twelve acid soils. The pattern of Al release from 1 g soil when leached slowly with 1.0M KCl solution showed the difficulty of distinguishing exchangeable from non-exchangeable Al. Al displaced in the first 10 cm3 of leachate was related to the exchangeable fraction, and comprised between 0.2 and 0.8 of the total mobile Al released by 500 cm3 KCl solution, for different soils. Shaking 4 g soil with 100 ml KCl for 30 min provided an adequate rapid estimate of exchangeable Al, but under-estimated large amounts and over-estimated small amounts. The equilibrium-solution concentration of AltAl was determined by a serial saturation procedure, but the activity ratio (αD)3/(αAl)2, or its logarithm, is suggested as a more appropriate function to characterize the cation balance. It can be evaluated approximately in a saturation extract, or after equilibrating soil with dilute CaCl2 solution at 1:1 ratio.
