Historical relationships among Argentinean biogeographic provinces based on mygalomorph spider distribution data (Araneae: Mygalomorphae)The present study used the previously defined biogeographic provinces from Argentina as the starting point for a parsimony analysis of endemicity and cluster analysis. The goal of the study was to use a dataset of distributional patterns of mygalomorph spiders from Argentina to evaluate the historical relationships of the biogeographic provinces. The analyses showed the following relationships: Yungas and Puna; Pampa and Chaco, Monte and Prepuna; Parana Forest and Araucaria angustifolia Forest; Central and Subandean Patagonia. Biogeographical regionalizations are useful as general reference models and their heuristic value should be explored by examining the geographical distribution of other taxa.
