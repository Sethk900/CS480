Multivariate assessment of environmental effects on hard red winter wheat. II. Canonical correlation and canonical variate analysis of yield, biochemical and bread-making characteristicsThe inconsistent production of winter wheat with acceptable bread-making quality in the Free State reduces the commercial value of the wheat crop. In the second part of this study, canonical correlation analysis was used to determine to what extent variation of biochemical components in wheat flours was responsible for differences in bread-making quality. In addition, the effects of environmental variables such as climate, crop history and edaphic attributes on yield, rheological and biochemical traits were examined by means of canonical variate analysis. It appeared that climatic factors contributed most to variation in yield and quality characteristics. Favourable conditions during the grain-filling period improved yield and modified storage and monomeric protein ratios. Modifications under stress-related conditions, however, were not sufficient to influence mixing requirement or baking quality.
