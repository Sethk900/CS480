The complete mitochondrial genome and phylogenetic analysis of forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii)The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii) was determined. Sequence analysis revealed that the organization of the mitochondrial genome in the forest musk deer was consistent with that of other reported mammals. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of the forest musk deer and 22 other species of the order Cetartiodactyla was conducted using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference methods based on the 12 heavyâ€strand proteinâ€coding genes, RNA genes and their combination. Both the consensus phylogenetic trees and the topologies test supported the monophyly of Cervidae, Bovidae and Cetancodonta, and placed Moschidae as a sister group to Cervidae/Bovidae. â€ These two authors contributed equally to this work.
