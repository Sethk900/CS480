Effect of environmental heterogeneity on field germination of Opuntia tomentosa (Cactaceae, Opuntioideae) seeds.We studied in Opuntia tomentosa the effect of plant shade (orientation and distance), and the place where the seeds remained before germination. Seeds were collected in 1998 and a) sown immediately on soil (non-buried seeds), b) stored in the laboratory and sown on soil during the 1999 rainy season (control) or c) buried after collection (under the shade of a tree, a rock and in an open space), exhumed 7 months later and sown in 1999 (exhumed seeds). Seeds were sown under or outside the shade of several trees; or on the northern, eastern and western sides of a 14-m-tall tree. In 1999, germination was high in all samples, but the control seeds had delayed germination. After two rainy seasons, non-buried seeds had the lowest germination rate. Germination was not affected by the distance from the tree. Outside of the plant's shade, germination was low. Germination was affected more by the environmental heterogeneity than by the individual plant shade. Germination probabilities were the highest at 16-19 °C; field germination was zero at 20.6 °C. Seed polymorphism and microenvironmental heterogeneity spread germination across two rainy seasons creating a permanent seed bank.
