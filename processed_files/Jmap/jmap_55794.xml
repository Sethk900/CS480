Measurement of the fate of acetic acid form carbon in soil solution of flooded soils using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with isotope ratio mass spectrometryCarbon-14 (14C) which can be taken into low molecular weight organic compounds (e.g. acetic acid, formic acid, methanol and ethanol) is one of the most important radionuclides released from transuranic waste disposal sites. To understand the fate of organic compounds in the soil environment, a stable carbon isotope, 13C, can be used as a tracer of 14C. In this study, 13C-labeled acetic acid was added to six soilâ€“water mixture samples and the chemical form changes in the soil solutions were measured by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The 13C-labeled acetic acid in the soil solutions was detected for the first 24 h, but could not be detected afterwards for any soil samples. Thus, in any soils that have similar properties to the soil samples used in the present study, most of the 13C-labeled acetic acid would likely be changed to other physico-chemical forms and be removed from the soil solutions in a very short time period. Less than 3% of the carbon added as acetic acid remained in the soil solutions, and was possibly mainly in inorganic forms. Carbon from acetic acid would not be retained in soil solutions for 48 h.
