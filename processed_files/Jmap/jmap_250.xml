Restoration of a Mediterranean Postfire Shrubland: Plant Functional Responses to Organic Soil Amendment.We investigated the potential of plant functional responses to speed up restoration in a postfire ecosystem. The patterns of change in plant nutrient uptake and water potential after compost amendment were monitored for 2 years in a 7-year-old postfire shrubland in southeastern France. We studied four different stress-tolerant species with contrasting life traits: three shrub species and a perennial herb. Three treatments were applied: control, 50 and 100 Mg/ha of fresh cocomposted sewage sludge and green waste. In both compost treatments, concentrations of all the macronutrients increased. The amendment improved N and cation nutrition, but the positive effect of compost on plant nutrient status was most apparent on leaf P concentrations, indicating that P was a limiting nutrient in this shrubland. Compost had no significant short-term effect on trace metal concentrations in plants. The plant nutrition response of different species to the compost varied; the nutritional status of <em>Brachypodium retusum</em> and <em>Cistus albidus</em> improved the most, whereas that of <em>Quercus coccifera</em> and <em>Ulex parviflorus</em> improved the least. Woody species exhibited no increase in N stocks. Phosphorus accumulation was also about three times higher in plots amended at 50 Mg/ha than in control plots for <em>B. retusum</em> and <em>C. albidus.</em> The severe summer drought of 2003 altered the compost effect. Contrary to our expectations, plants on amended plots did not exhibit a better water status in summer: the effect of the summer drought had a greater effect on water status than did the compost treatment.
