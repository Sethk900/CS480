Effects of nutrient supply on nutrient element content of two lachenalia cultivarsThe N, K, Ca, P and Mg content (% dry mass) of bulbs and leaves of two lachenalia cultivars, Romelia and Namakwa, was determined at different application levels of a basic nutrient formulation to develop norms for tissue analysis and fertilization. The formulation consisted of 0.37 g KNO3 + 0.36 g Ca(NO3)2 + 0.06 g MgSO4 + 0.013 g (NH4)2SO2 l−1 H2O. The plants were grown in silica sand and 150 g Super P nr3 (10.5% P) was incorporated in all treatments before planting. N, P and Ca content of the leaves at flowering was higher than in the bulbs at planting, flowering and at harvest. The P and Mg requirements of lachenalia appeared to be low. At full flower and the recommended nutrient level, N content of bulbs was 1.3–1.4%, and in leaves 1.9–2.4%. An N content 2.9–3.1% in leaves at full flower was measured at the high nutrient level. Differences in the response of the two cultivars to different N levels could be that Romelia formed offsets and Namakwa not.
