Movements, Survival, and Reproduction of Sage Grouse Translocated into Central IdahoThe success of translocations to restore sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) populations remains equivocal. Thus, we translocated 196 sage grouse to the Sawtooth Valley, Idaho, during March-April 1986-87 to determine whether translocated birds would survive and reproduce. Movements of 44 radio-tagged birds were extensive during the first 3-6 weeks post-release, and average distances from the release site for 10 females (5.3 +/- 0.9 km) were greater (P < 0.05) than those for 5 males (3.2 +/- 1.0 km). Four of 17 (24%) radio-tagged birds in 1986 and 11 of 27 (41%) in 1987 survived into the summer. Survival was lower (P < 0.0001) for 36 radio-marked and 8 patagial-tagged birds during the first 3 weeks post-release than during weeks 4-22 for 1986 and 1987. Five new leks were established by translocated birds. Seven nests of translocated hens averaged 3.6 +/- 0.2 km from the release site and 3 produced 14 young. Our data suggest that translocation can be useful in restoring sage grouse populations to suitable habitat.
