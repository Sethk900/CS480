Statistical characterization of soil biopores using a soil peel methodA simple method is presented for estimating the frequency and spatial dispersion of cylindrical biopores at field scale. Transmission voids, identified by in situ dye tracing techniques were studied using soil peels taken from the base of infiltrometer rings. Biopore spatial dispersion was found to be random and statistically characterized by a Poisson model. The influence of this model on sampling procedures for morphological studies was investigated. Results indicate that for this study, 33 quadrats of 400 cm2 would provide an estimate of the mean number of biopores > 0.5 mm diameter per quadrat within 10% of the true mean at the 0.05 significance level. As a general rule, the quadrat area should be sufficient to include a mean of at least ten biopores in the size range of interest. This permits estimation of quadrat sample numbers to be undertaken within the framework of Students t test.
