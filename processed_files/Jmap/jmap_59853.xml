Simulation Model to Prioritize Right-of-Way AcquisitionsAbstractThe costs involved in right-of-way (ROW) acquisition are rapidly increasing, making it more difficult for agencies to complete projects on time and budget. When funds are constrained, the question of what parcels should be purchased first to minimize the overall costs becomes relevant. The answer is related to the timing of the acquisition process and even opens the possibility of early ROW acquisition. Traditionally, early ROW purchases are selected based on expert judgment and on individual analyses, resulting in purchasing too late and having no substantial savings, if any. This paper presents an event-driven simulation model developed by Texas A&M for the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) to estimate costs and predict potential savings under different ROW acquisition scenarios. The Texas A&M Simulation Model (TAMSIM) is used to assist in prioritizing what parcels should be purchased first due to their likelihood of having a substantial cost increase. Four projects (Metro-East, Urban-North, Urban-South, and Rural-West) are used as case studies to demonstrate the applicability of TAMSIM.
