Complementary description of the genus Manohyphella Allen, 1973 (Insecta: Ephemeroptera: Teloganodidae), with some comments on its ecology in the Andasibe area (East Coast, Madagascar)Based on a large collection of material from the East Coast of Madagascar, we redescribe the endemic genus and species Manohyphella keiseri Allen, 1973. The male imago is described for the first time and details on the nymphal stage is provided, especially on the gill formula. The species M. animosa McCafferty & Benstead, 2002 and M. sphyxia McCafferty & Benstead, 2002 are considered as subjective junior synonyms of M. keiseri Allen, 1973. Notes on the life cycle of the species in the Andasibe area is presented, as well as data about the density of the populations. M. keiseri is an inhabitant of pristine running waters in rainforests and is therefore a good indicator for habitat quality.
