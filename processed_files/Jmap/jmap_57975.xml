Impact of the Three Gorges and Gezhouba Reservoirs on Ecohydrological Conditions for Sturgeon in the Yangtze River, ChinaAbstractThe Gezhouba Reservoir (GR) and Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) are the two largest water-storage projects in the middle reach of the Yangtze River. The impoundments of the reservoirs have changed natural flow-regimes in the river. This paper uses the Yichang Hydrological Station as a proxy for water-storage projects along the Yangtze River to assess alterations in river-flow conditions in three separate periods. The periods coincide with the start of water storage in the GR and TGR. The ecohydrological conditions in the river system are assessed based on annual discharge, water level, water temperature, and suspended-sediment concentration. More importantly, the entire analysis is done in relation to the Chinese sturgeon species, which face the danger of extinction in the Yangtze River. Based on the research reported in this paper, the impoundment of the GR and TGR increases downstream average annual water-temperature. In contrast, it decreases downstream average annual runoff, water level, and suspended-sediment concentration. The change of hydrological conditions negatively influences the spawning and hatching conditions of Chinese sturgeon. This change is the key reason that causes the fertilized rate of Chinese sturgeon eggs to decline.
