Disruption of fungal and bacterial biofilms by lauroyl glucoseAIM: The ability of enzymatically synthesized lauroyl glucose to disrupt fungal (Candida albicans, Candida lipolytica) and bacterial (Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, Pseudomonas aureofaciens) biofilms was investigated. METHODS & RESULTS: Preformed biofilms of C. albicans and C. lipolytica in polystyrene microtitre plates were disrupted upto 45% and 65%, respectively, while P. aeruginosa and P. aureofaciens biofilms were disrupted by 51% and 57%. Precoating of the microtitre wells with lauroyl glucose affected cell attachment and biofilm growth of all the cultures to a lesser extent. With C. albicans and C. lipolytica, there was 11% and 32% decrease in the development of biofilms, respectively. With P. aeruginosa and P. aureofaciens, the reduction was 21% and 12% after 48 h. Lauroyl glucose effectively inhibited the formation of biofilms on glass slide surfaces when added along with the inoculum. Analysis by confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that the growth of the biofilms was lesser as compared with the control experiments. Lauroyl glucose displayed minimum inhibitory concentration values >500 microg ml(-1) for the test cultures and was comparable to that obtained with acetyl salicylate. CONCLUSION: Lauroyl glucose reduces biofilm growth of all the four test cultures on polystyrene and glass surfaces. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This report is a novel application of the enzymatically synthesized, environmental-friendly nonionic surfactant.
