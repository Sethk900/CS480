Using canonical variate analysis to group small white bean cultivars canned in tomato sauce according to their canning qualityA laboratory-scale canning and evaluation method was employed to evaluate the canning quality of small white beans over cultivars, localities and seasons. Four small white bean cultivars, representing 15 localities from the 2001/02 season and six cultivars representing 17 localities from the 2002/03 season (n = 162 samples) were evaluated by determining the hydration coefficient, percentage washed drained weight, visual appearance, splits, size, texture, clumping and colour after canning. The data were interpreted using canonical variate analysis (CVA). Standard grade quality cultivars, PAN 185 and OPS-KW1, were used as references for the standard grade group and Teebus as the reference for choice grade. According to the CVA results, Teebus RR1, PAN 120, PAN 121 and PAN 123 corresponded with the choice grade standard canning quality of Teebus. These laboratory canning and evaluation methods in conjunction with CVA allowed cultivars to be grouped according to canning grades. The discriminative equations for CV1 and CV2, derived from the CVA, might be employed as a model in order to group the canning quality of samples to indicate similarity to a reference. After further verification this model might allow samples not included in these trials, but grown under similar conditions, to be evaluated for canning quality similarity to the choice grade reference.
