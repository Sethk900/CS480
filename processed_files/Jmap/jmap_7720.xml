Ecological studies of the butterfly Victorina stelenes (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) in Costa Rica and El SalvadorThe tropical nymphaline butterfly, Victorina (Metamorpha) stelenes (Linnaeus) is a widespread and familiar species of the day-flying Rhopalocera associated with forest clearing and borders through Central America and many parts of South America. It is one of the most commonly encountered and remembered butterflies seen in forests and secondary habitats. Precisely for this reason, that is, the widespread occurrence and usually high local abundance, that studies on the population biology of this species could provide insights into those ecological factors that help mold adaptive flexibility in herbivorous tropical insects in general. The apparent adaptive flexibility of V. stelenes in Central America is evidenced by its occurrence, as breeding populations, in both forest and agricultural habitats in Costa Rica and El Salvador, and undoubtedly elsewhere. Also, it is one of those tropical species which is very familiar to most tropical biologists, and as a mimic of Philaethria dido (Heliconiinae) it participates in one of the classical examples of Batesian mimicry in the New World Tropics. Although there exists at least one published account of the life cycle and food plant family of this butterfly (Seitz 1924), and although this species has undoubtedly been reared many times in unpublished studies, it is the purpose of this paper to bring together a consortium of information on the life cycle and natural history of this insect, to lay a foundation for further studies on its population biology and habitat flexibility. We use the phrase "ecological studies" in this paper to mean life cycle and natural historical properties underlying population biology.
