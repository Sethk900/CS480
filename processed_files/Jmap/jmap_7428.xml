Abundance fluctuations and habitat changes of soil beetles in central amazonian inundation forests (Coleoptera: Carabidae, Staphylinidae)Summary During the emersion phase of the years 1971/72 in three different inundation forests of Central‚ÄAmazonia the carbid and staphylinid fauna was studied. The three inundation forests were: (1) a site in the white water area of the Rio Solim√µes (Ilha de Curar√≠), (2) a site in a mixed water area (Lago Janauar√≠) and in the black water area of the Rio Tarum√£ Mir√≠m. The ‚Äúdominant‚Ä; species of the two mentioned families of Coleoptera were studied according to the abundance fluctuations and habitat change, by both the formalin pitfall trap method and the direct sampling method. The observed species are classified in six different groups each representing a different inhabiting mode: 1. a habitat change tree ‚Ä soil ‚Ä tree (Pentacomia egregia, Brachydirus batesi, Scopaeus sp. 1, Piestus sp., Meotachys platyderus, Colliuris sp. 1. Oxydrepanus ? brasiliensis). 2. soil dwellers migrating in accordance to the water level changes (Lathrobium sp., Meotachys sp. 2). 3. soil dwellers surviving the inundation phase by eggs (final proof is lacking). 4. tree dwellers, which are rarely found on the soil (Coproporus duplex). 5. beetles showing preference for neither the soil nor tree (Thoracophorus sp., Notiobia sp. 2). 6. soil dwellers, which come from external sources during the emersion phase, since their population was destroyed completely by the preceding inundation (Paratachys sp, Trogophloeus sp. 2).
