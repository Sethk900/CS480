Crepidula philippiana n. sp., nuevo gastropodo Calyptraeidae de Chile con especial referencia al patron de desarrolloSummary Crepidula philippiana n. sp., a new Calyptraeid gastropod from Chile with special reference to its development, A new species of Crepidula, C. philippiana n. sp., is described from the Southern coast of Chile. The species has been found attached to the inside of empty marine snail shells, generally inhabited by hermit crabs. C. philippiana is distinguished from other related marine species mainly by its reproductive strategy. The species shows direct development. Only one egg per capsule develops, the others remaining as nurse eggs; therefore this unique embryo consumes all the eggs contained in a capsule. In this way, few young snails are hatched per egg mass which attain a great size (3 mm) when passing to the extracapsular environment.
