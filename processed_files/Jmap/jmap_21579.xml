New shore bug (Hemiptera, Heteroptera, Saldidae) from the Early Cretaceous of China with phylogenetic analysesAbstract A new genus with a new species of Saldidae, Brevrimatus pulchalifer gen. et sp. n., is described and illustrated. The fossil specimen was found from the Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of Duolun County, Inner Mongolia, China. Phylogenetic analyses within Saldidae were performed, and the results indicate Brevrimatus pulchalifer gen. et sp. n. should be assigned to the subfamily Chiloxanthinae.
