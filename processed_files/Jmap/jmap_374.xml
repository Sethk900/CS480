Succession of Beaver Ponds in Colorado 50 Years After Beaver Removal.In 1954 and 1955, I conducted studies on 4 beaver (<em>Castor canadensis</em>) colonies in Routt County, Colorado, USA, to develop a reliable and practical census method. In fall of 1955, these colonies were trapped to extirpation to obtain accurate counts and colony compositions. I established photo stations and took a series of photographs approximately every 5Â years, in late September, from 1955 to 2005 to document beaver-population dynamics and beaver-pond successional changes after complete beaver removal. The number and configuration of dams, ponds, and canals remained remarkably similar, with maintenance conducted by succeeding generations of beaver. Quaking aspen (<em>Populus tremuloides</em>) and autumn willow (<em>Salix serissima</em>) boundaries also remained stable, but conifers slowly encroached. At 3 of 4 colony sites, beaver did not attempt to construct food caches for overwintering. By fall of 2005, the fourth site was also without a cache. Carrying capacity of these areas was likely limited by severe winter weather at 2,620-m to 2,900-m elevations, aspen depletion, pond-depth reduction, and sustained grazing by cattle. Although beaver carefully maintained dams, pond depths were reduced in most cases. This slow transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial system is a natural progression in this region.
