Characterization of maghemite in B horizons of three soils from Southern PortugalMaghemite with an unusual habit was identified in the sandy fraction of two Alfisols and one Ultisol by X-ray and electron diffraction. Hematite was also present. Morphological analyses by scanning and transmission electron microscopy showed needle-like particles of maghemite with average lengths of 200â€“500 nm depending on the degree of the crystallinity. Those particles are arranged in star-like patterns as shown by ultrathin sections. Experimental synthesis of maghemite was successfully attempted in the presence of quartz sand with the freshly-formed crystals displaying the same particular morphology. Formation of acicular maghemite catalysed by quartz surfaces is, therefore, postulated.
