Plant Area Index and microclimate underneath shrub species from a Chilean semiarid community.In drylands, environmental conditions under shrub canopy differ from those found in open sites. We should expect that microclimate conditions under shrubs with distinct canopy architecture should also be different. Plant Area Index (PAI) of the three most abundant shrubs species (Porlieria chilensis, Adesmia bedwellii and Proustia cuneifolia) in Bosque Fray Jorge National Park, north-central Chile was measured using a Plant Canopy Analyzer. During two years (2004-2005), we recorded the Relative Humidity and Air Temperature underneath and away from the canopy of the shrubs.
