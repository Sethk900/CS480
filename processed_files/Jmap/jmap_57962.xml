Curve Numbers for Low-Compaction Steep-Sloped Reclaimed Mine Lands in the Southern AppalachiansAbstractIn the coal-mining region of the Appalachians, the Forestry Reclamation Approach (FRA) is currently promoted by the U.S. Dept. of Interior, Office of Surface Mining (OSM). FRA’s goal in establishing native forest cover on reclamation sites requires the use of loose spoils rather than traditionally compacted spoils during hillslope reconstruction. Loose spoils improve tree planting survival and enhance overall forest growth. Although FRA has been shown to be successful on low-gradient slopes without excessive runoff leading to erosion, rainfall-runoff relationships have not been studied on steep slopes (>20°) where most surface-mine reclamation typically occurs. A curve number (CN) range representing low-compaction steep-sloped conditions was needed for Appalachian FRA sites. Three active surface-mine sites in East Tennessee were monitored during a 1-year period (June 2009–July 2010) for rainfall (5-min intervals) and runoff hydrology (discharge volume, peak discharge) using a unique Pinson-type collection system. CNs were estimated by the traditional NEH-4 (Part 630) method and two asymptotic, frequency-matching techniques. It was found that an initial abstraction (λ) of 0.2 best fits the data. CNs generated by the NEH-4 method among all three mining sites were not significantly different suggesting common shale-based loose spoils on steep slopes have similar runoff behavior. The CN determined by the asymptotic method provided an estimate with a practical range between 58.5 and 60. This CN range is lower than one would expect from surface-mine sites, suggesting infiltration influenced the measured rainfall-runoff relationships. Further research is needed to investigate the influence of slope and infiltration on runoff behavior at surface-mine sites applying FRA.
