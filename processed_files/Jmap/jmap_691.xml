Site-specific precipitation estimate from TRMM data using bilinear weighted interpolation technique: An example from KuwaitA bilinear weighted interpolation technique was used to generate site-specific precipitation data on a local scale. The modeled data compared remarkably well with the measured precipitation data from the eight stations located across the State of Kuwait over an 8-year monitoring period.
