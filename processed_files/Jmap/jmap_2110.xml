Response of soil surface CO2 flux in a boreal forest to ecosystem warming.Soil surface carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) flux (<em>R</em><sub>S</sub>) was measured for 2 years at the Boreal Soil and Air Warming Experiment site near Thompson, MB, Canada. The experimental design was a complete random block design that consisted of four replicate blocks, with each block containing a 15 m &times; 15 m control and heated plot. Black spruce [<em>Picea mariana</em> (Mill.) BSP] was the overstory species and <em>Epilobium angustifolium</em> was the dominant understory. Soil temperature was maintained (&sim;5 °C) above the control soil temperature using electric cables inside water filled polyethylene tubing for each heated plot. Air inside a 7.3-m-diameter chamber, centered in the soil warming plot, contained approximately nine black spruce trees was heated &sim;5 °C above control ambient air temperature allowing for the testing of soil-only warming and soil+air warming. Soil surface CO<sub>2</sub> flux (<em>R</em><sub>S</sub>) was positively correlated (<em>P</em> < 0.0001) to soil temperature at 10 cm depth. Soil surface CO<sub>2</sub> flux (<em>R</em><sub>S</sub>) was 24% greater in the soil-only warming than the control in 2004, but was only 11% greater in 2005, while <em>R</em><sub>S</sub> in the soil+air warming treatments was 31% less than the control in 2004 and 23% less in 2005. Live fine root mass (< 2 mm diameter) was less in the heated than control treatments in 2004 and statistically less (<em>P</em> < 0.01) in 2005. Similar root mass between the two heated treatments suggests that different heating methods (soil-only vs. soil+air warming) can affect the rate of decomposition.
