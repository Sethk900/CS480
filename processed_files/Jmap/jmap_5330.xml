Three new species of Billibathynella from Western Australia (Crustacea, Syncarida, Parabathynellidae)Three new species of Billibathynella Cho, 2005 are described from the arid region of Western Australia: B. wolframnoodti sp. nov., B. ilgarariensis sp. nov. and B. cassidis sp. nov. Illustrated descriptions of the three species are given. In general, these species differ from B. humphreysi, the only species of the genus previously known, in several meristic traits and qualitative characters. In particular, B. wolframnoodti is characterized by the presence of setae on the inner margin of the uropodal exopod, while B. ilgarariensis, most similar to B. humphreysi, is characterized by the presence of four setae on the exopod of the male thoracopod VIII. Billibathynella cassidis is distinguished by its helmet-like head. The peculiarities of the three new species, which lead to the slight amendment of the diagnosis of Billibathynella, are explained in the context of biogeographical data.
