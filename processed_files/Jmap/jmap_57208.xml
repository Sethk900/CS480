Identification of the Naegleria Species in Natural Watersheds Used for Drinking and Recreational Purposes in TaiwanAbstractNaegleria species (spp.) is a free-living amoeboflagellate that is widespread in natural environments. Some Naegleria spp. cause fatal human infections, and the most important source of these infections is water. This genus is recognized as a potential human pathogen that causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. In this study, 211 water samples were collected from two watersheds in Taiwan. The Naegleria spp. on the basis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with a genus-specific primer pair and an investigation of Naegleria spp. in the Puzih Rivers and Kaoping Rivers in Taiwan. The percentage of positive samples obtained from the Kaoping River (21.8%) was higher than that from the Puzih River (0.6%). The presence/absence of Naegleria spp. within the water samples showed a significant difference with levels of water temperature and pH value. The most frequently identified Naegleria spp. was N. philippinensis (n=3), followed by N. clarki (n=2), N. gallica (n=2), and N. americana (n=2). N. australiensis, N. dobsoni, N. gruberi, and N. schusteri were each detected once. The presence of Naegleria spp. should be considered a potential public health threat; therefore, regularly maintaining normally operated water treatment facilities and implementing effective management strategies are critical for protecting public health.
