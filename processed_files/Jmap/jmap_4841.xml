The new species can be distinguished by having fewer sensillae; two-segmented mandibular exp; Mx1 praecoxa more spinulose, Mx2 with spinules on three syncoxal endites, and Mxp with spinules on outer margin. Additional characters related to the female P5 and P1 and the male A1 and P2 are also helpful to distinguish this species from its congeners.
