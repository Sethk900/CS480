Risk Analysis for Real-Time Flood Control Operation of a ReservoirAbstractThere are many uncertainties in real-time flood control operation of a reservoir, which create risks in flood control decision making. In this paper, three uncertainty factors—reservoir inflow-forecasting errors, outflow errors, and observation errors of reservoir storage capacity curve—are taken into account and quantified methods are proposed. With consideration of the three uncertainties and correlation between inflow-forecasting errors, reservoir water-level errors are derived using the stochastic differential equation of reservoir flood routing. Then the definition and calculation methods for flood risk at each moment and the integrated risk of the entire flood process are proposed. The Dahuofang reservoir in China is selected as the case study. The results shows that the risk resulting from the uncertainties is decreased by the reservoir flood regulation function and that the proposed method can provide a useful way to estimate the risks in real-time reservoir flood control.
