CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes from soybean and barley double-cropping in relation to tillage in JapanTo examine whether no-tillage cultivation of upland fields mitigates greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, seasonal changes in CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions were measured for conventional tillage cultivation and no-tillage cultivation over a whole year (May 13, 2002 to May 13, 2003) in Tsukuba, Japan, which has a temperate climate. The soil respiration rate depended on soil temperature, and increased with a rise of soil temperature. Annual soil respiration amount was 2845 +/- 967 g CO2 m(-2) y(-1) in the conventional tillage cultivation plot and 2198 +/- 656 g CO2 m(-2) y(-1) in the no-tillage cultivation plot, *but there was no significant difference between the two plots. Thus, the annual soil respiration amount under no-tillage conditions cultivation showed a decrease by 23% from that under conventional tillage. When organic matter was incorporated into the soil by plowing-in of the crop residue in the conventional tillage plot after harvesting the crops, the soil respiration rate and N2O flux increased rapidly. The majority of the difference (648 g CO2 m(-2) y(-1)) of the annual soil respiration amount between the conventional tillage and the no-tillage plots corresponded to the difference in that from fallow periods (444 g CO2 M per period). A comparison of total greenhouse gas emissions in terms of carbon equivalent (the sum of emissions of each type of greenhouse gas multiplied by its global warming potential) from soybean and barley doublecropping using conventional tillage and no-tillage methods showed that lower carbon emission of 183 g carbon m(-2) y(-1) was possible by the use of no-tillage cultivation. These results clearly show that no-tillage cultivation is one of the most promising strategies for mitigation of greenhouse gas emission from the agricultural sector.
