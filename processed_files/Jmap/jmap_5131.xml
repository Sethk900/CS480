First record of the family Cheidae (Amphipoda, Gammaridea) from the Brazilian coast, with description of two new genera and new speciesTwo new genera of the family Cheidae, previously monotypic, are herein described from Brazilian waters; these represent the first record of this family to Brazil. The first genus, Ruffosius gen. nov., is described based on the new species, R. fluminensis sp. nov., from Rio de Janeiro, and is mainly characterized by the uniramous uropod 2. The second genus, Microcheus gen. nov., also corresponds to a new species, M. nortoni sp. nov., and is distinguished from the other genera by the 2-articulate palp of maxilla 1. The latter is described based on material collected from Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina States. This study provides full descriptions of these two new genera and species and an identification key for species of the family Cheidae.
