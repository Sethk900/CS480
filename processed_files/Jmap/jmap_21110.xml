Dos and Don'ts for butterflies of the Habitats Directive of the European UnionAbstract Twenty-nine butterfly species are listed on the Annexes of the Habitats Directive. To assist everyone who wants or needs to take action for one of these species, we compiled an overview of the habitat requirements and ecology of each species, as well as information on their conservation status in Europe. This was taken from the recent Red List and their main biogeographical regions (taken from the first reporting on Article 17 of the Directive). Most important are the Dos and Don'ts, which summarize in a few bullet points what to do and what to avoid in order to protect and conserve these butterflies and their habitats.
