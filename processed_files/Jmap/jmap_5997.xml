Effect of leaf-section position and physiological stage of the donor plant on Lachenalia leaf-cutting performanceThe effect of leaf-section position and physiological stage of the donor plant on leaf cutting performance was determined on three Lachenalia cultivars, viz ‘Romelia’, ‘Rupert’ and ‘Robyn’. Performance was evaluated in terms of leaf cutting survival, number of bulblets formed, and mass and size of the bulblets produced. In all three cultivars, the productivity of proximal cuttings exceeded that of distal cuttings in all variables examined. The optimal physiological stage to take leaf cuttings was found to be when the inflorescence was visible between the sheaths of the leaves, and the worst was at full flowering. As the donor plant matured, there was a reduction in the number; size and mass of bulblets produced by leaf cuttings. Cultivars responded differently to different variables.
