Evaluation of Low-Stress Herding and Supplement Placement for Managing Cattle Grazing in Riparian and Upland Areas.Management practices are often needed to ensure that riparian areas are not heavily grazed by livestock. A study was conducted in Montana during midsummer to evaluate the efficacy of low-stress herding and supplement placement to manage cattle grazing in riparian areas. Three treatments were evaluated in three pastures over a 3-yr period in a Latin-square design (<em>n</em>=9). Each year, naïve 2-yr-old cows with calves were randomly assigned to the three treatments: 1) free-roaming control, 2) herding from perennial streams to upland target areas, and 3) herding to upland sites with low-moisture block supplements. Stubble heights along the focal stream were higher (<em>P</em>=0.07) in pastures when cattle were herded (mean±SE, 23±2 cm) than in controls (15±3 cm). Global positioning system telemetry data showed that herding reduced the time cows spent near (<100 m) perennial streams (<em>P</em>=0.01) and increased the use of higher elevations (<em>P</em>=0.07) compared with controls. Evening visual observations provided some evidence that free-roaming cows (44%±19%) were in riparian areas more frequently (<em>P</em>=0.11) than herded cows (23%±6%). Fecal abundance along the focal stream was less (<em>P</em>=0.07) with herding (61.9±11.4 kg·ha<sup>−1</sup>) than in controls (113.2±11.4 kg·ha<sup>−1</sup>). Forage utilization within 600 m of supplement sites was greater (<em>P</em>=0.06) when cows were herded to low-moisture blocks (18%±6%) compared with controls and herding alone (8%±2%). Moving cattle to uplands at midday using low-stress herding is an effective tool to reduce use of riparian areas. Herding cattle to low-moisture blocks can increase grazing of nearby upland forage but may not provide additional reduction in cattle use of riparian areas compared with herding alone.
