Description of the advertisement and distress call of Chacophrys pierottii and comments on the advertisement call of Lepidobatrachus llanensis (Anura: Ceratophryidae)Chacophrys is a monotypic genus in the family Ceratophryidae which also contains Ceratophrys and Lepidobatrachus. In this paper an analysis of the acoustic repertoire of Chacophrys pierottii is presented and compared with calls from other Ceratophryidae species. The advertisement call of Chacophrys is composed of pulsed notes with a higher dominant frequency and a marked bioacoustic differentiation with respect to Ceratophrys and Lepidobatrachus. Moreover, new contributions to the bioacoustical knowledge of Lepidobatrachus llanensis are reported.
