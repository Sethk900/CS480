Effects of Simulated Nitrogen Deposition on Soil Respiration in Northern Subtropical Deciduous Broad-leaved ForestTo investigate the effects of elevated nitrogen deposition on forest soil respiration, a simulated nitrogen deposition field experiment was conducted in northern subtropical deciduous broad-leave forest from April 2008 to April 2009. Nitrogen treatments included the control (no N addition, CK), low-N [50 kg . (hm(2) . a)(-1), T-L], medium-N [100 kg . (hm2 . a)(-1), T-M,], and high-N [150 kg . (hm(2) . a)(-1), T-H]. The respiration rates were measured by a static chamber-gas chromatograph method. Results showed that nitrogen deposition did not change the seasonal and daily variation patterns of soil respiration. Compared to the control, T-L, T-M and T-H treatments reduced soil annual average respiration rates by 8.51%, 9.74% and 11.24%, respectively. Meanwhile, T-L, T-M and T-H treatments decreased daily average soil respiration rates by 4.42%, 11.09% and 12.17%, respectively. Significant relationship was found between soil respiration rate and soil temperature. The Q(10) (temperature sensitivity coefficients) for soil respiration of CK, T-L, T-M and T-H treatments were 2.53, 3.22, 2.64 and 2.92, respectively. Our findings suggested that nitrogen deposition reduced soil respiration, and increased soil respiration temperature sensitivity in northern subtropical deciduous broad-leave forest.
