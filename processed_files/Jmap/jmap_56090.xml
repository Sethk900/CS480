The effect of Lantana camara Linn. invasion on soil chemical and microbiological properties and plant biomass accumulation in southern ChinaThe chemical and microbiological properties of the soil beneath the exotic species Lantana (Lantana camara Linn.) and its effect on the growth of three plant species were investigated to evaluate whether Lantana is a harmful invader in southern China. Soils were sampled from underneath (IN) Lantana canopy, on the edge of the canopy (ON) and 2–5 m away (OUT) from the Lantana individuals. Soil chemical properties, respiration, enzyme activities, microbial biomass and functional diversities based on the community level physiological profiles (CLPP) assay with BIOLOG EcoPlates™ were determined. Biomass accumulation of Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum), mungbean (Vigna radiata) and radish (Raphanus sativus) grown in the soils was compared. The IN soils had significantly higher pH, total N, total P, available N and available P than the ON and OUT soils. Soil respiration, enzyme activities and microbial biomass N and P were also significantly higher in the IN soils. Biomass accumulation of Italian ryegrass and radish was significantly increased in the IN soils compared to the ON and OUT soils while mungbean was not significantly affected. The results indicated that Lantana improved soil fertility, accelerated N and P cycles, utilized carbon substrates more effectively, had higher functional diversity and did not inhibit the growth of the studied species. These initial findings suggest that Lantana can improve soil quality for other plant species. Further investigation is required to evaluate possible long-term ecological risks of using Lantana for ecological restoration in this region.
