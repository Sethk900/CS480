Zonación y estructura de la comunidad macrofaunística en playas de arena del Sur de Chile (Mehuín, Valdivia)Summary Zonation and Structure of the Macrofaunistic Community in Sandy Beaches of Southern Chile (Mehuín, Valdivia) Two beaches of Mehuín (Valdivia) were studied with the purpose of finding out the zonation and structure of the macrofaunistic community in sandy beaches of Southern Chile. Some variability is present between the species composition of the two beaches studied. Notwithstanding, a general scheme for the zonation of the beaches at Mehuín is proposed. The upper level of the midlittoral zone is occupied by talitrid amphipods (O. tuberculata) and cirolanid isopods (E. braziliensis). The intermediate level by cirolanids (E. braziliensis, E. hirsuticauda and E. monodi), theinferior level by anomuran decapods (E. analoga), polychaetes (N. impressa) and bivalves (M. donacium) and the upper level of the infralittoral zone by idotheid isopods (C. paucidens, M. mehuinensis, M. setifer and M. aff. lilianae), haustorid amphipods (two species), anomuran decapods (L. chilensis and B. spinimana) and brachyuran decapods (B. picta), further of E. analoga, N. impressa and M. donacium. These results are discussed and compared with some of the zonation schemes proposed by other authors. Of all the specimens captured the crustacea are the numerically dominant group and, amongst these the peracarids are the most represented taxa. The possible causes for the macrofauna distribution on the beaches at Mehuín, together with the density values and diversity indexes calculated for each site are discussed.
