 Abyssal Fauveliopsidae (Annelida) from the South East AtlanticDuring the DIVA-1, DIVA-2 and BIOZAIRE expeditions to the deep sea Angola, Cape and Guinea Basins in the southeastern Atlantic Ocean, two species of Fauveliopsidae were collected at various stations. The material obtained is described by light and scanning electron microscopy. One species is new to science and herein described as Fauveliopsis confusa sp. nov. The other is compared with the already well-known species Laubieriopsis brevis. The material and description includes adult and juvenile stages of L. cf. brevis which differ in their chaetae. The uncertainty in recognizing the anterior end in contracted material of F.Â confusa has been solved by histology using light microscopy.
