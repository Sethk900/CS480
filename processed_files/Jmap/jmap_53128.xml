Stigmaphyllon patricianum-firmenichianum (Malpighiaceae), a new species from Loyalty Islands, New CaledoniaA new species of Stigmaphyllon (Malpighiaceae) is described: Stigmaphyllon patricianum-firmenichianum Butaud. It is restricted to the coral islands of Ouvéa, Lifou and Maré in the Loyalty Islands Province (New Caledonia) and is most similar to S. discolor (Gand.) C.E.Anderson, known from New Caledonia and Solomon Islands. Previously, plants now known as S. patricianum-firmenichianum were included in Stigmaphyllon taomense (Baker f.) C.E.Anderson, endemic to the northern part of Grande-Terre and Belep Islands (New Caledonia). A new circumscription of S. taomense is proposed. The regional key for New Caledonian species of Stigmaphyllon is updated.
