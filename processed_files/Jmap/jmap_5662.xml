Natural history of the marsupial Thylamys macrurus (Mammalia, Didelphidae) in fragments of savannah in southwestern BrazilThe objective of this study was to furnish information on the natural history of the Neotropical marsupial Thylamys macrurus in the southern Cerrado of Brazil. A range expansion of the species was observed to the northeast of the Mato Grosso do Sul state, Brazil. Specimens were surveyed in fragments of savannah (40â€“600Â ha) during dry and wet seasons in 2003 and 2004 with liveâ€trap grids and pitfall lines. With an effort of 9767 trap nights and 2200 pitfall nights, we obtained 102 captures and 49 recaptures of T. macrurus. The data analyzed (57 males and 40 females) showed that males are more abundant in the dry season and females in the wet season. Young were recorded mostly during the wet season. Thylamys macrurus was scansorial, using the floor and the understorey. Sexual dimorphism was recorded, with males being larger than females. Information on ectoparasites is supplied.
