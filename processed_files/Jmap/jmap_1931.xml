Long-term carbon exchange in a sparse, seasonally dry tussock grassland.Rainfall and its seasonal distribution can alter carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) exchange and the sustainability of grassland ecosystems. Using eddy covariance, CO<sub>2</sub> exchange between the atmosphere and a sparse grassland was measured for 2 years at Twizel, New Zealand. The years had contrasting distributions of rain and falls (446 mm followed by 933 mm; long-term mean=646 mm). The vegetation was sparse with total above-ground biomass of only 1410 g m<sup>-;2</sup>. During the dry year, leaf area index peaked in spring (November) at 0.7, but it was <0.2 by early summer.
