Taxonomy of the genus Aetheomorpha Lacordaire (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Cryptocephalinae: Clytrini) from China, with description of five new speciesThis paper studies the taxonomy of the genus Aetheomorpha Lacordaire, 1848 (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Cryptocephalinae: Clytrini) occurring in China. Five new species are described: Aetheomorpha bidentata sp. nov. from Sichuan, Aetheomorpha bilobata sp. nov., Aetheomorpha obtusapicata sp. nov., Aetheomorpha punctistriata sp. nov. and Aetheomorpha wangi sp. nov. from Yunnan. Aetheomorpha furcata Medvedev and Kantner, 2002 is reported from China for the first time. The Chinese fauna of the genus is therefore increased to 16 species. A key to species is provided in the text in addition to colour plates and line drawings of habitus, maxilla, labium, male genitalia and female spermatheca and rectal sclerites, which are very helpful for species identification.
