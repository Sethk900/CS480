Mobility and phytoavailability of arsenic in an abandoned mining areaThe mobility and phytoavailability of arsenic in an area affected by the abandoned exploitation of an arsenical tungsten–tin deposit was studied to establish the current and eventual environmental risks and to propose possible remediation practices. Soil and plant samples were collected at different distances from the polluting sources and analyzed for their As content and distribution. Critical soil total concentrations of As were found, with values in the range 175–2300 mg kg− 1. The readily labile As contents represent < 0.2% of the total concentrations, whereas the As contents more prone to be mobilized could rise up to 25%. Different phytostabilizing plants were identified, namely, Agrostis castellana (Boiss. & Reut.), Centaurea jacea L., Eryngium campestre L. and Scirpus holoschoenus L.. Such plants show important root bioaccumulation factor values in relation to the labile As contents (up to 197, 58, 201 and 88, respectively) and low translocation factor values (down to 0.170, 0.032, 0.173 and 0.036, respectively). Additionally to promote the revegetation with these plants, the species Rumex acetosella L. should be eliminated as this behaves as an index plant, reaching above-ground As concentrations up to 218 mg kg− 1.
