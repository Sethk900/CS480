Analisis de la craneometria diferencial entre la vicuña (Vicugna vicugna) y la alpaca (Lama guanicoë pacos)Abstract Using a total of 43 craneological data obtained from any of 73 vicugna and 25 alpaca skulls, three problems were analyzed: • Identification of skulls • Taxonomic situation of the vicugna • Origin of the alpaca. For rapid identification of New World cameloid skulls it is recommended to use the condilobasal length, the length to heigth ratio and the presence of the Fissura nasolacrimalis. Some characteristics of the skulls considered essential for the evaluation of domestication processes exclude the vicugna from the alpaca's ancestors.
