High thermal conductivity epoxy molding compound filled with a combustion synthesized AlN powderA combustion synthesized AlN powder was studied for its feasibility as a filler for epoxy molding compound (EMC) and effects of various experimental parameters on the thermal conductivity and moisture resistance of the EMC were investigated. The AlN powder was coated with silane both to increase the moisture resistance of the EMC and to enhance the bonding between the filler AlN and the matrix resin. The thermal conductivity could be significantly increased by using AlN powders with large particle sizes and this was considered to be due to a reduction in interface area between the AlN particles and the matrix resin. A thermal conductivity of 14 W/mK was obtained when the EMC was fabricated by a process involving no use of a solvent and a AlN powder with a particle size of 35.3 Î¼m and a filler content of 67 vol % were used.
