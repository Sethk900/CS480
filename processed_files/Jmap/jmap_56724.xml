Subfossil statoblasts of Lophopodella capensis (Sollas, 1908) (Bryozoa, Phylactolaemata, Lophopodidae) in the Upper Pleistocene and Holocene sediments of a montane wetland, Eastern Mau Forest, KenyaLophopodella capensis (Sollas, 1908) is only known from a limited number of palustrine and lacustrine sites in southern Africa and single sites in both Kenya and Israel. Statoblasts of L. capensis were found preserved in the Upper Pleistocene and Holocene aged sediments of Enapuiyapui wetland, Eastern Mau Forest, western Kenya. The wetland is a headwater microcatchment of tributaries that feed into the Mara River and the Lake Victoria Basin. Bryozoan taxa were not surveyed in a 2007 macroinvertebrate biodiversity assessment. The presence of L. capensis at this site marks the second observation of this taxon in Kenya, 65 km from Lake Naivasha, where observed prior, and in a location some 1000 meters higher. The results suggest Bryozoa should be included in aquatic biodiversity surveys that target these wetlands and that bryozoan remains should be incorporated into palaeoecological studies as useful palaeoenvironmental indicators.
