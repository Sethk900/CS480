Three new species of Yponomeutinae (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae) from China with faunistic supplements and an updated list of the Chinese species of the subfamilyTo improve our understanding of the Yponomeutinae of China, the specimens of three institutional collections were examined to discover new taxa and all previous records were reviewed. As a result, we recognize a total of 71 species of Chinese Yponomeutinae, including three new species: Cedestis leucopterostigmatis n. sp., Euhyponomeutoides spadix n. sp., and Yponomeuta zebra n. sp., and a new record of Zelleria japonicella Moriuti from China. Unavailability of three species names in the most recent list: Yponomeuta hebeiensis Liu, 1984, Yponomeuta nigrofasciatus Yang, 1979, and Yponomeuta ulingensis Yang, 1979, is suggested. Photos of adults and genitalia are provided for all species described.
