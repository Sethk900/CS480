Monolepta Chevrolat, 1837, the most speciose galerucine taxon: redescription of the type species Monolepta bioculata (Fabricius, 1781) and key to related genera from (Chrysomelidae, Coleoptera)Monolepta Chevrolat, 1837 is the most speciose galerucine genus, with about 600 described nominal species mainly from tropical and subtropical regions, including 180 species from continental Africa. In the past, the generic delimitation of other taxa based on typological concepts was very inconsistent, and needs to be redefined. To ensure the correct generic placement of species, based on phylogenetic principles, a comprehensive knowledge of the morphology of the type species, Monolepta bioculata (Fabricius, 1781) is necessary, which is presented herein. External and genital characters are figured, and data on distribution and ecology are provided. A phylogenetic analysis of some crucial taxa, and an identification key to all genera of afrotropical galerucines with elongated basiâ€metatarsus are provided. Chimporia LaboissiÃ¨re, 1931a (Â =Â syn. nov.) is synonymized with Monolepta. *. 23rd contribution to the taxonomy, phylogeny and biogeography of afrotropical Galerucinae.
