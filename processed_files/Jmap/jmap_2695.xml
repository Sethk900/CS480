The intertwined population biology of two Amazonian myrmecophytes and their symbiotic ants.A major question in ecology is: how do mutualisms between species affect population dynamics? For four years, we monitored populations of two Amazonian myrmecophytes, <em>Cordia nodosa</em> and <em>Duroia hirsuta,</em> and their symbiotic ants. In this system, we investigated how positive feedback between mutualistic plants and ant colonies influenced population processes at two scales: (1) how modular organisms such as plants and ant colonies grew, or Î·-demography, and (2) how populations grew, or <em>N</em>-demography. We found evidence of positive feedback between ant colony and plant growth rates. Plants with mutualistic ants (<em>Azteca</em> spp. and <em>Myrmelachista schumanni</em>) grew in a geometric or autocatalytic manner, such that the largest plants grew the most. By contrast, the growth of plants with parasitic ants (<em>Allomerus octoarticulatus</em>) saturated. Ant colonies occupied new domatia as fast as plants produced them, suggesting that mutualistic ant colonies also grew geometrically or autocatalytically to match plant growth. Plants became smaller when they lost ants. While unoccupied, plants continued to become smaller until they had lost all or nearly all their domatia. Hence, the loss of mutualistic ants limited plant growth. <em>C. nodosa</em> and <em>D. hirsuta</em> live longer than their ant symbionts and were sometimes recolonized after losing ants, which again promoted plant growth. Plant growth had fitness consequences for ants and plants; mortality and fecundity depended on plant size. Positive feedback between ants and plants allowed a few plants and ant colonies to become very large; these probably produced the majority of offspring in the next generation.
