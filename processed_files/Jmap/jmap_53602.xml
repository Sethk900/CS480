A new genus and two new species of Pterostichini from China, with ‚Äúsphodrine-like‚Ä parameres (Coleoptera, Carabidae)A new genus of Pterostichini, Apophylon Gu√©orguiev & Sciaky, gen. n. (type species: Apophylon schillhammeri Gu√©orguiev & Sciaky, sp. n.) is proposed for Apophylon schillhammeri Gu√©orguiev & Sciaky, sp. n. (type locality: China, SE Guizhou Province, Leishan County, SE Kaili) and Apophylon pangu Gu√©orguiev & Sciaky, sp. n. (type locality: China, NW Hunan Province, Wulingyuan District, near the town of Wulingyuan). These two species share a unique combination of characters, not known in any other Pterostichini. The new genus can be distinguished by having (1) a left paramere without transverse apophysis; (2) a falcate right paramere, with styloid apex, broadened medial part and subbasal hasp; (3) a median lobe with dorsal ostium; (4) metatarsomeres 1-2 setose on the medioventral surface, in addition to the lateroventral setae; (5) meso- and metatarsomeres 1‚Äì4 with two dorsolateral grooves diverging distally; and (6) elytral striae with shining isodiametric microreticulation, which is in contrast to less shining transverse-mesh microreticulation on the elytral intervals.
