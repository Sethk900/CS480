Taxonomic remarks about Semiclivina (Kult, 1947) new status, with description of Uroclivina subgen. n., and of two new species from South America (Coleoptera, Carabidae, Scaritinae, Clivinini)Abstract The subgenus Semiclivina Kult, 1947 of Clivina Latreille, 1802 (sensu lato) has been re-ranked as a genus, with the most readily observed feature being the stridulation organ of the proepisterna and front femora. A group of species within Semiclivina is characterized by a peculiar acute tubercle at the posterior margin of the eye, which corresponds to an equally noticeable incision of the anterior margin of the pronotum. This group is considered as monophyletic and placed as such in the subgen. n. Uroclivina. The species Semiclivina (Uroclivina) bergeri sp. n. from Argentina and southern Brazil and Semiclivina (Uroclivina) schmidi sp. n. from French Guyana are described. The following additional species are included in Uroclivina: Clivina urophthalmoides (Kult, 1947) new combination, Clivina urophthalma (Putzeys, 1863) new combination, and Clivina oxyomma (Putzeys, 1868) new combination. The two subgenera of Semiclivina Kult, and the current five species of Uroclivina are differentiated in a key.
