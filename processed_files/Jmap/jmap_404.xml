The Initial Phase of a Longleaf Pine-Wiregrass Savanna Restoration: Species Establishment and Community Responses.The significant loss of the longleaf pine-wiregrass ecosystem in the southeastern United States has serious implications for biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. In response to this loss, we have initiated a long-term and landscape-scale restoration experiment at the 80,125 ha (310 mi<sup>2</sup>) Department of Energy Savannah River Site (SRS) located near Aiken, South Carolina. <em>Aristida beyrichiana</em> (wiregrass), an important and dominant grass (i.e., a "matrix" species) of the longleaf pine savanna understory, and 31 other herbaceous "non-matrix" species were planted at six locations throughout SRS in 2002 and 2003. Of the 36,056 transplanted seedlings, 75% were still alive in June 2004, while mean 1-2 year survival across all planted species was 48%. <em>Lespedeza hirta</em> (hairy lespedeza) exhibited the greatest overall survival per 3 &times; 3 m cell at 95%, whereas <em>Schizachyrium</em> spp. (little bluestem) exhibited the greatest mean cover among individual species at 5.9%. Wiregrass survival and cover were significantly reduced when planted with non-matrix species. Aggregate cover of all planted species in restored cells averaged 25.9% in 2006. High rates of survival and growth of the planted species resulted in greater species richness (SR), diversity, and vegetative cover in restored cells. Results suggest that the loss of the longleaf pine-wiregrass ecosystem may be ameliorated through restoration efforts and illustrate the positive impact of restoration plantings on biodiversity and vegetative cover.
