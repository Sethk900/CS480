Effects of agroecological land use succession on soil properties in Chemoga watershed, Blue Nile basin, EthiopiaThis study appraises the effects of land use on soil properties in a typical watershed in the northwestern highland of Ethiopia. Soil samples were collected from major land use types in the watershed: natural forests, cultivated lands, grazing lands and Eucalyptus plantations. The natural forests served as a control against which to assess changes in soil properties resulting from the establishment of the other land use types. Samples were taken at two depths (0–15 and 15–30 cm) in the upstream and downstream areas of the watershed and analyzed for a range of soil properties. The soils in the cultivated fields, grazing lands and Eucalyptus plantations showed significantly higher sand content, but lower Ca2+ and Mg2+ contents and cation exchange capacity (CEC) compared to soils under natural forests. Eucalyptus soils had a statistically significant higher bulk density (BD) than soils under the other three land use types. The forest and Eucalyptus soils also differed significantly from each other in their soil organic matter (SOM) and total N contents. A significant difference in available P among soils of the four land use types was caused by the difference between cultivated and Eucalyptus soils. In contrast, the distribution of soil silt fraction Na+, K+ and pH values did not differ among the four land use types. Significant differences in many of the soil properties were also observed between soils in the two sampled villages. The study underscores the need for policies and strategies for sustainable land use that will attune objectives of economic development to environmental management at the regional and local levels.
