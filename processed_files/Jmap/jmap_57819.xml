Linear Programming Method Considering Topographical Factors Used for Estimating Missing PrecipitationAbstractA new linear programming method with an option for topographical factors is developed for estimating missing precipitation. It is simply assumed that missing precipitation depth at a base station is expressed as a linear combination of precipitation depths at neighboring index stations in the same period using weighting factors. Also, the topographical factor, which is proportional to the weighting factor, is introduced into the method. The topographical factor is associated with distance and difference in elevation between the base station and the index station. In this research two case studies show an introduction of the topographical factors into the existing linear programming method for estimating missing precipitation and makes weighting factors in the method change into those reflecting the topography of precipitation points. The developed method with an option is useful in estimating the missing precipitation values in the case of hilly regions only when the option is taken after applying four options.
