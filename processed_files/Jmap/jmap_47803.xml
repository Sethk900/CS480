UAV photogrammetry and structure from motion to assess calving dynamics at Store Glacier, a large outlet draining the Greenland ice sheetThis study presents the application of a cost- effective, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to investigate calv- ing dynamics at a major marine-terminating outlet glacier draining the western sector of the Greenland ice sheet. The UAV was flown over Store Glacier on three sorties dur- ing summer 2013 and acquired over 2000 overlapping, geo- tagged images of the calving front at an ∼40cm ground sampling distance. Stereo-photogrammetry applied to these images enabled the extraction of high-resolution digital ele- vation models (DEMs) with vertical accuracies of ±1.9m which were used to quantify glaciological processes from early July to late August 2013. The central zone of the calv- ing front advanced by∼500 m, whilst the lateral margins re- mained stable. The orientation of crevasses and the surface velocity field derived from feature tracking indicates that lat- eral drag is the primary resistive force and that ice flowvaries across the calving front from 2.5md−1 at the margins to in excess of 16md−1 at the centreline. Ice flux through the calving front is 3.8×107m3 d−1, equivalent to 13.9 Gt a−1 and comparable to flux-gate estimates of Store Glacier’s an- nual discharge.Water-filled crevasses were present through- out the observation period but covered a limited area of be- tween 0.025 and 0.24% of the terminus and did not appear to exert any significant control over fracture or calving. We conclude that the use of repeat UAV surveys coupled with the processing techniques outlined in this paper have great potential for elucidating the complex frontal dynamics that characterise large calving outlet glaciers.
