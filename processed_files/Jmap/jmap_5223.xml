The cicadas of Colombia including new records and the description of a new species (Hemiptera: Cicadidae)The cicada fauna of Colombia is determined. A list of species reported from Colombia in the literature is provided along with synonymies, the description of Orellana castaneamaculata Sanborn, sp. nov., and the first Colombian records of 14 cicada species. Two species are assigned to new genera. Cicada xanthospila Germar, 1830 is transferred to Bergalna Boulard and Martinelli, 1996 to become Bergalna xanthospila (Germar, 1830) comb. nov. and Fidicina bogotana Distant, 1892 is transferred to Dorisiana Metcalf, 1952 to become Dorisiana bogotana comb. nov. The generic affiliation of Orellana brevis Distant, 1905 and Orellana columbia (Distant, 1881) is clarified with O. brevis being reassigned to Zammara. The first records of Zammara smaragdula Walker, 1858, Plautilla hammondi Distant, 1914, Diceroprocta bicosta (Walker, 1850), Proarna dactyliophora Berg, 1879, Fidicinoides brisa (Walker, 1850), Fidicinoides distanti (Goding, 1925), Fidicinoides flavibasalis (Distant, 1905), Fidicinoides flavipronotum Sanborn, 2007, Fidicinoides poulaini Boulard and Martinelli, 1996, Bergalna xanthospila (Germar, 1830), Majeorona aper (Walker, 1850), Carineta argentea Walker, 1852, Taphura sauliensis Boulard, 1971, and Durangona tigrina Distant, 1911 are provided. Proarna bergi (Distant, 1892) is removed from the Colombian cicada fauna. The additions bring the total cicada diversity of Colombia to 63 species and represent a 31.3% increase in faunal diversity. Three subfamilies, 10 tribes and 18 genera are represented within the Colombian cicada fauna.
