A COMPARISON OF METHODS TO MEASURE SOIL RESPIRATIONSoil respiration measurements obtained using 5 techniques were compared over several growing seasons. The soil CO2 profile method gave the highest values, those of the dynamic-chamber method (continuous analysis of CO2 in flowing air) usually being lowest and those of the above-canopy micrometeorological method being intermediate. Most methods showed the soil respiration increasing from about 50 mg CO2/m2 .cntdot. h at the beginning of the growing season to a peak in late July-early Aug, followed by a decline to near 20 mg by late Sept. The soil CO2 and static-chamber (alkali absorption) methods agreed closely. Differences between methods were explained by inaccuracies in determining transfer coefficients for CO2, differences in the component fluxes of total soil respiration, which each technique included, disturbances to the system caused by the method, such as removal of green shoots, and sampling errors. [The 5th method used was the in-canopy micrometeorological method].
