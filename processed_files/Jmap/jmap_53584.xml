Oahutanais makalii , a new genus and species of colletteid tanaidacean (Crustacea, Peracarida) from shelf-waters off Hawaii, with a taxonomic keyA new colletteid tanaidacean, Oahutanais makalii gen. et sp. n., is described from Hawaiian coastal waters at depths ranging from 19 to 102 m. The new taxon is tentatively designated as a new genus, although it displays many features in common with the genus Leptognathiella. The new species is distinguished from the morphologically similar tanaidomorphans by having (1) a small body, less than 1.0 mm (reproductively active specimens), (2) a maxillule with two bifid spiniform setae; (3) a maxilliped palp article-2 with geniculate, finely pectinate spiniform seta on sub-distal inner margin, (4) a cheliped attachment ventrally via sclerite not connected to the carapace, and (5) the pereopods 1 to 6 with ischial seta shorter than the merus. A key to the five extant genera of Colletteidae in the North Pacific Ocean is presented herein.
