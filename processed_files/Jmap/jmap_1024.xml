Seed dispersal by domestic goats in a semiarid thornscrub of Mexico.Previous studies conducted in the semiarid thornscrub of the Biosphere Reserve of Tehuacan-Cuicatlan have reported a high consumption of cactus and legume fruits by domestic goats. To test the hypothesis that goats may effectively disperse seed, we collected domestic goat feces from different microhabitats (bare ground, under shrub or under tree). The area occupied by each microhabitat was measured in the field. We then quantified the presence of viable seeds in goat feces and their deposition in microhabitats suitable for seedling establishment. We collected 209 seeds and using a seed reference collection, we identified these as belonging to three endemic cactus species, two legumes and several unidentified species. A high proportion of the cactus seeds germinated. Although most of the feces were found in open areas, more than 30% were recorded beneath the canopies of perennial plants, a suitable microhabitat for seedling establishment and survival. Contrary to the general assumption that goats cause only degradation of vegetation, these findings show that goats can effectively disperse viable seeds of diverse species. Studies that evaluate the ecological role of goats as important elements of biotic interactions are needed in order to generate an adequate management program for livestock.
