Revision of the genus Phloeoditica Schedl - with description of two new genera and two new species in Phloeosinini (Coleoptera, Curculionidae, Scolytinae)Abstract The genus Phloeoditica Schedl currently includes four species from Southeast Asia. These species vary substantially in important morphological characters and indicate the existence of multiple genera for these species. A revision based on morphological and in part molecular data resulted in the transfer of Phloeoditica setosa to Pseudoxylechinus the erection of a new genus Asiophilus for Phloeoditica phloeosinoides and a new species Asiophilus macropunctatus from Vietnam. Another new genus with affinities to Phloeoditica is described based on the new species Microditica uniseriata from Thailand. The new genera are included in a revised key to the tribe Phloeosinini.
