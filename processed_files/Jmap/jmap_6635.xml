Evaluation of five pecan (Carya illinoensis) cultivars for nut qualityFive pecan [Carya illinoensis (Wang.) K. Koch] cultivars, commercially recommended for the Transvaal middleveld areas were evaluated for nut quality (nut size, kernel %, kernel colour, nut shape and shell thickness). New South African grading standards are suggested for nut size and kernel % in order to bring the South African standards into line with the U.S.A. and world standards. Using these revised South African standards the grading of the five cultivars according to nut size was as follows: Mahan, extra large; Ukulinga, large; Barton and Success, medium; and Moore, small (average of 16 years). The grading of these cultivars according to kernel % was medium (52,6% to 54%) except Moore which was poor (47,2%). The average length: width ratio for all cultivars is 2,0 (3 years, average). The kernel colour ratings were between 3 and 4 for all cultivars except Success (4–5), which was acceptable and not too dark. The shell thickness varied from thick to medium for the five cultivars, averaging about 960 μm.
