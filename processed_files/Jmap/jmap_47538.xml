Species richness and edge effects on bat communities from Perobas Biological Reserve, Paran√°, southern BrazilWe investigated the influence of edge effects on the composition of bat species communities in Perobas Biological Reserve. Mist nets were set along forest edges and in fragments; 170 individuals and 13 species were captured. Eleven species were registered in the forest and nine in the edge, and mean number of captures by month was significantly lower in edge habitat. Artibeus lituratus and Sturnira lilium were the most frequently captured species. Some species were sampled exclusively in the edge; others were captured only in forest. Insectivorous bats were more frequently captured in more open edge habitats.
