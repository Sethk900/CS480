Rapid viability tests for kernels of grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.)Various procedures were evaluated for their potential as rapid viability tests for kernels of grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.). The tests included were a specific gravity test, a conductivity test (with drastically reduced soaking periods), the determination of glutamic acid dehydrogenase activity (GADA) and oxygen uptake rate of ground kernels, and a tetrazolium test on ground kernel samples. Specific gravity and oxygen uptake procedures showed the greatest potential as rapid viability tests. The specific gravity test has the advantage of being rapid, simple and inexpensive.
