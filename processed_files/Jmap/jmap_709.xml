Effect of post-fire defoliation on bud viability and plant mortality of Piptochaetium napostaense (Speg.) Hack. and Poa ligularis Ness.The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of post-fire defoliation on axillary bud viability and mortality of Piptochaetium napostaense (Speg.) Hack. and Poa ligularis Nees. at different phenological stages. Both species are cool-season perennial native grasses highly preferred by cattle in the semi-arid region of central Argentina. The following treatments were established for each species: no defoliation (control), early-season defoliation (vegetative stage) and late-season defoliation (internode elongation stage). Ten plants were assigned randomly to each treatment. Fire treatment was applied at the end of the annual growing cycle of both species.
