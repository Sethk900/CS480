A taxonomic overview of marine and estuarine oligochaetes from BrazilAquatic oligochaetes from South America are still poorly known. As a basis for a general survey of marine oligochaetes from the southwestern Atlantic, we present here a critical overview of the available taxonomic information on marine and estuarine oligochaetes from Brazil. Only 13 of the 600 described species are currently known from Brazil, and 8 exclusively from their type locations. The enchytraeid Marionina cf. nevisensis is newly reported from São Sebastião (São Paulo State). The distribution range of the naidid Tectidrilus gabriellae is expanded to the Paranaguá Bay (Paraná, S Brazil).
