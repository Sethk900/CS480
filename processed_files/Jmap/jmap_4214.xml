Pupal morphology of several species of tiger beetle (Coleoptera: Cicindelidae) from Central Amazonian floodplains (Brazil)Abstract The pupal morphology of the following species of tiger beetle (Col.: Cicindelidae) from the Brazilian Amazon is described: Tetracha sobrina punctata (Castelnau), Phaeoxantha klugii Chaudoir, P. lindemannae (Mandl) and P. aequinoctialis bifasciata (Brull√©). The pupae of all Phaeoxantha species were obtained from ex ovo rearings and those of Tetracha sobrina punctata came from larvae collected in the field and reared in the laboratory. The results indicate that the most significant features for identification are the frontal median boss, the distal margin of the labrum and the spines of the abdominal tergites. An identification key of the studied species is given.
