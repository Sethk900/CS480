Description of a new fireworm, Eurythoe turcica sp. nov. (Polychaeta: Amphinomidae), from the Levantine coast of Turkey (eastern Mediterranean), with reâ€descriptions of Eurythoe parvecarunculata Horst and Amphinome djiboutiensis Gravier based on type mateThe present study describes a new fireworm belonging to the genus Eurythoe, E. turcica sp. nov., collected from Iskenderun Bay and its vicinity (Levantine Sea, Turkey), and reâ€describes the closely related species E. parvecarunculata Horst, 1912 and Amphinome djiboutiensis Gravier, 1902, based on the type material. The new species is mainly characterized by having a rounded and short caruncle occupying only chaetiger 1, and dendritically branched branchiae from chaetiger 3 to the end of body. Morphological features of E. turcica are closely similar to those of E. parvecarunculata but the former species lacks the serrated capillary chaeta with a long spur on the notopodia of the median parapodia. The present study also shows that A. djiboutiensis and E. parvecarunculata, which were previously considered synonymous, are distinct species.
