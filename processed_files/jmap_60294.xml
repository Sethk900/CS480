Constructed Wetland Planning-Based Bilevel Optimization Model under Fuzzy Random Environment: Case Study of Chaohu LakeAbstractTo optimize regional economies, social employment, and water quality protection, a multiobjective bilevel optimization model under a fuzzy random environment based on constructed wetland planning is developed in this study. Fuzzy random variables are used to describe the uncertainties in the system, and three special fuzzy random simulation methods are proposed to address the fuzzy random variable calculations. From the inherent bilevel model interaction, a new algorithm called the fuzzy random simulation-based nested genetic algorithm (FRS-based NGA) is designed as an intelligent solution to solve the model. Then, the model is applied to a real-world case: the Chaohu Lake watershed, China. The results under different objective values, probability levels, and possibility levels are compared so that an optimal scheme for regional economic development, social employment, and the wetland construction scale can be identified. Finally, the comparative analysis, sensitivity analysis, and convergence analysis are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm.
