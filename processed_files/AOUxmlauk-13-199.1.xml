Although such displays are widely hypothesized to flush potential prey and enhance foraging performance, experimental evidence that they function in this way was previously available only from redstarts (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Myioborus</named-content></italic> spp.). I provide additional evidence from an experimental study of the Hooded Warbler (<italic>Setophaga citrina</italic>) in northwestern Pennsylvania, USA. Hooded Warblers regularly flick their tails while foraging, revealing large white spots on the outer tail feathers. I tested the function of the white tail spots with plumage manipulation experiments. At nests containing 5-day-old nestlings, the attending adults were captured and assigned to one of two treatment groups. For experimental birds, I temporarily darkened the white tail spots with a brown marking pen; for sham-darkened controls, I applied a comparable amount of ink to the dark inner rectrices. Experimental birds with darkened tails showed significantly reduced foraging performance compared with controls, and the decline in foraging performance was driven almost entirely by a decreased frequency of aerial prey attack. High-definition video recording at nests showed that plumage manipulation also altered the types of prey females delivered to nestlings; females with darkened tails delivered significantly fewer winged insects, and proportionally more insect larvae, than controls. However, the types of prey delivered by males were unaffected by plumage manipulation. Tail-flicking behavior codevelops with independent foraging in juveniles and is a significant positive predictor of juvenile foraging performance, even when the effects of juvenile age and activity are controlled statistically. Collectively, these results provide strong support for the hypothesis that white tail spots and tail-flicking behavior of Hooded Warblers function to flush visually oriented winged prey and enhance foraging performance. They also raise questions about sexual dimorphism in the tail pattern and its relationship to possible sex differences in foraging strategies.Muchas especies de aves insect&iacute;voras tienen parches de plumaje contrastantes que son usualmente desplegados durante el forrajeo. Aunque generalmente se sugiere como hip&oacute;tesis que estos despliegues espantan a las presas potenciales y mejoran el desempe&ntilde;o de forrajeo, la evidencia experimental de que funcionan de esta manera s&oacute;lo est&aacute; disponible para las especies de <italic>Myioborus</italic>. Aqu&iacute; brindamos evidencia adicional a partir de un estudio experimental de <italic>Setophaga citrina</italic> en el noroeste de Pensilvania, USA. Los individuos de <italic>S. citrina</italic> hacen &ldquo;parpadear&rdquo; sus colas con regularidad mientras forrajean, mostrando grandes manchas blancas en las plumas externas de la cola. Evalu&eacute; la funci&oacute;n de las manchas blancas de la cola con experimentos de manipulaci&oacute;n del plumaje. En nidos que conten&iacute;an pichones de m&aacute;s de 5 d&iacute;as de edad, los adultos asistentes fueron capturados y se les asign&oacute; uno de dos tratamientos. A las aves experimentales, les oscurec&iacute; temporalmente las manchas blancas de la cola con un marcador marr&oacute;n; a un segundo grupo control oscurecido, apliqu&eacute; una cantidad comparable de tinta a las rectrices oscuras internas. Las aves experimentales con las colas oscurecidas mostraron una reducci&oacute;n significativa en el desempe&ntilde;o de forrajeo con relaci&oacute;n a los controles, y la disminuci&oacute;n en el desempe&ntilde;o de forrajeo estuvo dado casi completamente por una disminuci&oacute;n en la frecuencia de ataques a presas a&eacute;reas. Los registros de video de alta definici&oacute;n en los nidos muestran que la manipulaci&oacute;n del plumaje tambi&eacute;n altera el tipo de presas que las hembras entregan a los pichones; las hembras con las colas oscurecidas entregaron significativamente menos insectos alados y proporcionalmente m&aacute;s larvas de insectos que los controles. Sin embargo, los tipos de presas entregadas por los machos no se vieron afectados por la manipulaci&oacute;n del plumaje. El comportamiento de parpadeo de la cola se desarrolla conjuntamente con la independencia de forrajeo de los juveniles y es un predictor positivo significativo del desempe&ntilde;o de forrajeo de los juveniles, aun cuando los efectos de la edad y de la actividad del juvenil son estad&iacute;sticamente controlados. En conjunto, estos resultados apoyan con fuerza la hip&oacute;tesis de que las manchas blancas de la cola y el comportamiento de parpadeo de la cola de <italic>S. citrina</italic> funcionan para espantar a presas aladas influenciadas por se&ntilde;ales visuales y mejoran el desempe&ntilde;o de forrajeo. Ellos tambi&eacute;n plantean preguntas sobre dimorfismo sexual en el patr&oacute;n de la cola y su relaci&oacute;n con posibles diferencias sexuales en las estrategias de forrajeo.<italic>Palabras clave:</italic> comportamiento de forrajeo, comportamiento de parpadeo de la cola, despliegues de forrajeo, manchas de la cola, <italic>Setophaga citrina</italic>Many species of insectivorous birds have striking plumage patches on their wings, tails, or rumps that are often displayed conspicuously during foraging.

The American Redstart is a flush-pursuit forager that is convergently very similar to the <italic>Myioborus</italic> redstarts. On both its breeding and wintering grounds, American Redstarts use animated spread-tail foraging displays that are thought to flush potential prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Robinson1">Robinson and Holmes 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Robinson2">1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Lovette1">Lovette and Holmes 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Sherry1">Sherry and Holmes 1997</xref>). Because conspicuous tail spots and tail-spreading displays are strongly associated with high rates of flycatching in the Parulidae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Ficken1">Ficken and Ficken 1962</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Burtt1">Burtt 1986</xref>), it is likely that other warbler species also use their tails to flush winged prey.One parulid warbler whose tail spots are especially likely to play a role in foraging is the Hooded Warbler (<italic>Setophaga citrina</italic>). Like the American Redstart, the Hooded Warbler is a basal member of a large clade of 34 <italic>Setophaga</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Lovette2">Lovette et al. 2010</xref>), all of which have conspicuous tail spots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Curson1">Curson et al. 1994</xref>). Hooded Warblers have large white patches on the inner vanes of the three outer rectrices (rectrices 4&ndash;6), and &sim;20&percnt; of birds also have a smaller white patch on the inner vanes of rectrix 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-f01">Figure 1</xref>). The extent of white in the tail is mildly sexually dimorphic, with males having slightly more white than females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Curson1">Curson et al. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Chiver1">Chiver et al. 2011</xref>). During foraging, males and females continuously flick open their tails, revealing the conspicuous white tail spots that contrast with the olive green of the rest of the tail. Previous authors have noted the many morphological and behavioral similarities between Hooded Warblers and <italic>Myioborus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Curson1">Curson et al. 1994</xref>) and have suggested that the tail-flicking behavior of Hooded Warblers may play a role in foraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Chiver1">Chiver et al. 2011</xref>). Although Hooded Warblers are not considered flush-pursuit foragers, they regularly engage in aerial foraging maneuvers, including sallying (flycatching) and hover-gleaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Remsen1">Remsen and Robinson 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Chiver1">Chiver et al. 2011</xref>).Here, I examine the role of white tail spots and tail-flicking behavior in the foraging strategy of the Hooded Warbler. Using field experiments in which the tail spots of nesting adults were temporarily darkened, as well as data on the development of foraging behavior in juveniles, I tested the hypothesis that white tail spots and tail-flicking behavior help flush visually oriented potential prey and enhance foraging performance. I specifically tested four predictions of the prey-flushing hypothesis. (1) Birds with experimentally darkened tails will show reduced foraging performance compared with sham-darkened controls, and the decline in foraging performance will be driven largely by a decreased frequency of aerial prey attack. (2) Birds with experimentally darkened tails will provision nestlings at a rate lower than that of sham-darkened controls. (3) Experimental darkening of the tail will alter the types of prey delivered to nestlings, resulting in a relatively low proportion of visually oriented flying prey and a relatively high proportion of nonflying prey. (4) Tail-flicking behavior in juveniles will codevelop with independent foraging and be an important predictor of juvenile foraging performance.The study was conducted during four consecutive nesting seasons (May&ndash;August, 2010&ndash;2013) at Hemlock Hill Field Station in Crawford County, northwest Pennsylvania. Hemlock Hill has been the site of many previous studies of Hooded Warblers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-EvansOgden1">Evans Ogden and Stutchbury 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Howlett1">Howlett and Stutchbury 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Chiver2">Chiver et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Schaef1">Schaef and Mumme 2012</xref>) and supports a population of 40&ndash;50 territorial nesting pairs. More than 400 nests were found and monitored during the 4 yr of the study, and 175 breeding adults were captured in mist nets and color-banded.This experiment was conducted during June 6&ndash;July 15, 2010, and focused on the nests of 14 breeding pairs with two to four 5-day-old nestlings. I controlled for brood size by randomly assigning the first nest of a particular brood size to either the experimental or control treatment group, and then alternating treatments for additional nests of that size for the remainder of the nesting season. Control (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 7) and experimental (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 7) nests did not differ significantly in either mean hatch date (15 June &plusmn; 4 days vs. 17 June &plusmn; 6 days, <italic>t</italic> &equals; 0.34, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.74) or brood size (2.9 &plusmn; 0.3 vs. 3.1 &plusmn; 0.3 nestlings, <italic>t</italic> &equals; 0.59, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.56).When nestlings were 5 days old, I captured the breeding adults with mist nets placed near nests. For birds at experimental nests, I used a broad-tipped brown Staedtler Lumocolor 350 permanent marker to darken the white inner vanes of the outer rectrices of both the female and the male. For sham-darkened birds at control nests, I used the same marking pen to apply a comparable amount of ink to the dark inner vanes of the inner rectrices.After giving birds 24 hr to recover from the effects of capture and handling, I collected foraging data on adults from experimental and control nests during the midmorning through early afternoon (0900&ndash;1430 hours). Once a foraging individual had been located and identified, I followed it and recorded its behavior on a hand-held recorder. Behaviors recorded included hops, tail-flicks, flights, and three types of prey-attack maneuvers: perch-gleans (or &ldquo;gleans&rdquo;; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Remsen1">Remsen and Robinson 1990</xref>), in which a perched bird pecked at potential prey on adjacent vegetation; hover-gleans (or &ldquo;sally-hovers&rdquo;; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Remsen1">Remsen and Robinson 1990</xref>), in which a hovering bird pecked at potential prey on vegetation; and sallying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Remsen1">Remsen and Robinson 1990</xref>), in which flying birds attacked aerial prey. Because prey items were often small and difficult to see, I was seldom able to determine whether a given prey attack was successful or unsuccessful. I therefore used attack maneuvers rather than successful prey captures in analyses of foraging performance. Because birds foraging in dense vegetation were frequently lost from view, foraging samples were derived from many brief observation bouts (usually 10&ndash;30 s each) that were collected over a period of 2&ndash;4 hr. Control (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 14) and experimental (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 14) birds did not differ significantly in either duration of the total foraging sample (6.1 &plusmn; 0.6 min vs. 5.4 &plusmn; 0.6 min, <italic>t</italic> &equals; 0.84, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.41) or mean time of data collection (1204 hours &plusmn; 1 hr vs. 1055 hours &plusmn; 1 hr, <italic>t</italic> &equals; 0.95, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.36).Although I used a &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; marker for the plumage manipulations, the brown ink typically lasted only a few days, and after 5&ndash;7 days it was difficult to tell that a bird had been treated at all. Plumage manipulation also had no lasting effect on feather structure; I recaptured one female 6 wk after her tail had been darkened, and both the color and structure of her outer tail feathers appeared to be identical to those of untreated birds.Plumage manipulation experiments in 2011&ndash;2012 were similar to those performed in 2010. However, instead of measuring treatment effects on foraging performance, I used a tripod-mounted high-definition video camera (Panasonic HDC-TM80K) at nests of 25 breeding pairs to document provisioning rate and the types of prey delivered to nestlings by experimental and control birds. Adults were captured at nests with two to four 5-day-old nestlings and given 24 hr to recover from the effects of capture and handling before video recording began. Mean duration of the video sample at each nest was 146 &plusmn; 9 min. During video analysis, I recorded the number of provisioning visits made by each adult and categorized prey items as follows: (1) unwinged larval insects, (2) adult Diptera (flies), (3) adult Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies), (4) unidentified winged insects, (5) arachnids (primarily spiders and harvestmen), and (6) unidentified prey items. Results from categories (2)&ndash;(4) were summed to provide a composite measure of winged prey, both as a total delivery rate and as a proportion of all identifiable prey items (excluding category (6)).Experimental design in 2011 was identical to that of 2010, and data were collected from 14 nests (7 control and 7 experimental). Control and experimental nests did not differ significantly in either date (June 21 &plusmn; 6 days vs. June 23 &plusmn; 5 days, <italic>t</italic> &equals; 0.13, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.90) or time (1005 hours &plusmn; 20 hr vs. 0935 hours &plusmn; 25 hr, <italic>t</italic> &equals; 1.03, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.32) of the video sample. In 2012, to better control for among-territory variation, I used a slightly different experimental design in which one member of the pair was assigned to the experimental treatment while its mate served as the sham-darkened control. Sex of the bird to be darkened was randomly determined for the first nest treated, and then alternated for the rest of the nesting season. Data were collected from 11 nests, 6 with darkened males and sham-darkened females and 5 vice versa. Thus, over the course of the 2 yr, video recordings were obtained from a total of 25 breeding pairs.From July 15 to August 29, 2013, I collected data on the development of foraging behavior in known-age color-banded juveniles using the same data-collection methods described above for adults. Young Hooded Warblers usually fledge when they are 9 days old and reach independence &sim;4 wk later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Chiver1">Chiver et al. 2011</xref>). A total of 65 separate foraging samples were obtained throughout daylight hours (0730&ndash;1620 hours) from 37 juveniles (11&ndash;40 days old). Mean duration of the foraging samples was 4.0 &plusmn; 0.3 min. For comparative purposes, I also collected foraging data from 13 adults (8 females and 5 males) during the same period. These samples, along with data from the 14 control birds in the 2010 foraging performance experiment, were used to compare foraging behavior and performance of adults and developing juveniles.All statistical analyses were conducted using JMP version 10.0 for Mac OS X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-SASInstitute1">SAS Institute 2012</xref>). Data collected from the 2010 foraging performance experiment were analyzed using mixed-model analyses of variance (ANOVAs) in which experimental treatment and sex of the treated bird were included as fixed factors and nest was included as a random effect. Because preliminary modeling revealed no significant effects of either date or time of day, and because the experimental design largely controlled for these variables, neither was included as a factor in the final models. Mixed models were calculated using the recommended REML (restricted maximum likelihood) method with unbounded variance components. Residuals of all models were examined to ensure normality (Shapiro-Wilk test) and homoscedasticity, and log or square-root transformation of the dependent variable was employed when necessary.Similar mixed-model ANOVAs were used to analyze video data from the 2011&ndash;2012 experiment on provisioning of nestlings; because preliminary modeling revealed no significant effects of year, date, or time of video sample, these variables were not included as factors in the final models. Data on the development of tail-flicking and foraging behavior in juveniles were analyzed by multiple regression.

Differences in foraging performance were driven largely by differences in rates of hover-gleaning (experimental birds: 0.9 &plusmn; 0.1 hover-gleans min<sup>&minus;1</sup>; controls: 1.5 &plusmn; 0.1 hover-gleans min<sup>&minus;1</sup>; <italic>F</italic><sub>1,12</sub> &equals; 13.5, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.0032). Experimental treatment had a marginally significant effect on sally rate (experimental birds: 0.16 &plusmn; 0.05 sallies min<sup>&minus;1</sup>; controls: 0.54 &plusmn; 0.13 sallies min<sup>&minus;1</sup>; <italic>F</italic><sub>1,12</sub> &equals; 4.6, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.053), but essentially no effect on perch-glean rates, which were nearly identical for experimental and control birds (0.23 &plusmn; 0.07 and 0.24 &plusmn; 0.06 perch-gleans min<sup>&minus;1</sup>, respectively; <italic>F</italic><sub>1,12</sub> &equals; 0.1 &lsqb;square-root-transformed&rsqb;, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.80).Despite the significant effects on foraging performance, darkening of the tail had no significant effect on foraging effort; experimental birds hopped and tail-flicked at rates that were comparable to those of sham-darkened controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-t01">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-f02">Figure 2</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-f02">2</xref>C).For the 2011&ndash;2012 video data, experimental treatment had no significant effect on provisioning of nestlings, as measured by feedings per nestling per hour (mixed-model ANOVA, <italic>F</italic><sub>1,43.6</sub> &equals; 1.3 &lsqb;log transformed&rsqb;, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.26). However, the treatment &times; sex interaction approached statistical significance (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,38.2</sub> &equals; 3.1, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.089). The provisioning rate of experimental females with darkened tails was &sim;70&percnt; that of control females (1.2 &plusmn; 0.1 and 1.7 &plusmn; 0.2 feedings nestling<sup>&minus;1</sup> hr<sup>&minus;1</sup>, respectively; <italic>F</italic><sub>1,41.3</sub> &equals; 4.2, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.048). By contrast, provisioning rates of experimental and control males were nearly identical (1.7 &plusmn; 0.2 and 1.6 &plusmn; 0.2 feedings nestling<sup>&minus;1</sup> hr<sup>&minus;1</sup>, respectively; <italic>F</italic><sub>1,41.3</sub> &equals; 0.2, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.70).Of 539 total prey items delivered to nestlings, 93 (17.3&percnt;) could not be identified to a specific prey category. However, the hourly rate at which unidentified prey were delivered to nestlings was not significantly influenced by experimental treatment, sex, or the treatment &times; sex interaction (all <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.15, square-root-transformed data). Thus, unidentifiable prey items were more-or-less equitably distributed among all treatment and sex categories and unlikely to bias analyses based on identifiable prey. Of the 446 items that could be categorized, the great majority were either insect larvae (42.8&percnt;, primarily Lepidoptera) or adult Diptera (32.5&percnt;, primarily crane flies, family Tipulidae). The remaining prey items were unidentified winged insects (13.7&percnt;), adult Lepidoptera (9.0&percnt;), and arachnids (2.0&percnt;).Mixed-model ANOVAs indicated a significant treatment &times; sex interaction for both winged prey delivered per hour (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,38.0</sub> &equals; 11.8 &lsqb;log transformed&rsqb;, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.0014) and proportion of total prey that were winged (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,33.8</sub> &equals; 9.9, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.0034). Experimental females with darkened tails delivered many fewer winged insects to nestlings than sham-darkened control females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-f03">Figure 3</xref>). For males, however, darkening of the tail spots had no effect on delivery of winged prey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-f03">Figure 3</xref>). A significant treatment &times; sex interaction was also found for the proportion of prey that were insect larvae (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,32.2</sub> &equals; 10.2, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.0032). Only 26.6 &plusmn; 6.9&percnt; of the prey delivered by control females were larvae, compared with 59.2 &plusmn; 6.8&percnt; of the prey delivered by experimentally darkened females. By contrast, larval insects constituted almost identical proportions of the food items delivered by control and experimental males (44.3 &plusmn; 7.5&percnt; and 44.7 &plusmn; 6.0&percnt;, respectively).Fledglings &lt;18 days old were largely immobile, never flicked their developing tails, and did not forage on their own. By day 18, however, juveniles began to become active foragers, and tail-flick rate, hop rate, and prey-attack rate increased steadily throughout the period of dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-f04">Figure 4</xref>). After day 35, when juveniles were approaching independence, tail-flick rate, hop rate, and prey-attack rate were generally comparable to the rates for adult birds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-f04">Figure 4</xref>). Juveniles usually left their natal territories around days 40&ndash;45, and the oldest juveniles I observed being fed by their parents were 40 days old.To disentangle the effects of age, hop rate, and tail-flick rate on juvenile foraging performance, I conducted a multiple-regression analysis of the effects of these variables on prey-attack rate. Because juveniles &lt;27 days old seldom foraged independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-f04">Figure 4</xref>), this analysis excluded observation bouts from younger fledglings and samples &lt;100 s in duration. Total sample size was 29 independent foraging samples. In this analysis (adjusted <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &equals; 0.62), both hop rate (<italic>t</italic> &equals; 4.6, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.0001) and tail-flick rate (<italic>t</italic> &equals; 3.0, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.0064) were significant positive predictors of prey-attack rate. Juvenile age was also positively related to prey-attack rate, but not significantly so (<italic>t</italic> &equals; 1.8, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.081). Neither date (<italic>t</italic> &equals; &minus;1.04, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.31) nor time of day (<italic>t</italic> &equals; &minus;0.98, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.33) was a significant predictor of juvenile foraging performance when these factors were added to the regression model.The results provide three compelling lines of evidence that the white tail spots and tail-flicking behavior of Hooded Warblers enhance foraging performance and capture of aerial prey. First, experimental birds with darkened tails showed significantly reduced overall prey-attack rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-f02">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-t01">Table 1</xref>) compared with sham-darkened controls, and the influence of plumage treatment on foraging performance was driven entirely by effects on rates of aerial attack maneuvers (i.e. hover-gleaning and sallying), not by effects on perch-glean foraging. Second, experimental darkening of white tail spots significantly altered the types of prey that females delivered to nestlings; experimental females with darkened tails delivered significantly fewer flying insects, and proportionally more nonflying insect larvae, than sham-darkened control females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-f03">Figure 3</xref>). Third, tail-flicking behavior codevelops with independent foraging in juveniles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-f04">Figure 4</xref>) and is a significant predictor of prey-attack rate in juveniles, even when the effects of juvenile age and activity level are statistically controlled.Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that white tail spots and tail-flicking behavior constitute an important foraging adaptation for Hooded Warblers. They add to the growing body of literature indicating that striking plumage &ldquo;ornaments&rdquo; and displays may arise outside the context of intraspecific social or sexual signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Brooke1">Brooke 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Tarvin1">Tarvin and Murphy 2012</xref>), and that conspicuous plumage patterns can provide direct utilitarian benefits in foraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Jablonski1">Jab&lstrok;o&nacute;ski 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Mumme1">Mumme 2002</xref>) or antipredator behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Murphy1">Murphy 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Stang1">Stang and McRae 2009</xref>).The precise mechanism by which white tail spots and tail-flicking behavior promote foraging performance in Hooded Warblers is not entirely clear. Unlike <italic>Myioborus</italic> species, Hooded Warblers do not show true flush-pursuit foraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Remsen1">Remsen and Robinson 1990</xref>), in which potential prey are flushed and then pursued and captured following intricate aerial maneuvers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Jablonski1">Jab&lstrok;o&nacute;ski 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Mumme1">Mumme 2002</xref>). Nonetheless, it is likely that tail-flicking displays by Hooded Warblers startle and flush winged insects, particularly dipterans and other insects known to be sensitive to such displays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Jablonski1">Jab&lstrok;o&nacute;ski 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Jablonski4">Jab&lstrok;o&nacute;ski and Strausfeld 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Galatowitsch1">Galatowitsch and Mumme 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Jablonski3">Jab&lstrok;o&nacute;ski et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Mumme2">Mumme et al. 2006</xref>). Once flushed and visible to a foraging bird, these insects can then be captured by aerial attack maneuvers, including hover-gleaning and sallying.The results of my study also raise two additional questions. First, why did darkening of the white tail spots alter the types of prey delivered to nestlings by females but not by males? One possible answer is that female and male Hooded Warblers may have different foraging strategies, as has been demonstrated in other warblers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Morse1">Morse 1968</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Holmes1">Holmes 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Petit1">Petit et al. 1990</xref>), and that nesting females may be more affected by plumage manipulation than males. This possibility is supported by evidence that females tend to be more active foragers than males; in my sample of foraging behavior of adults in unmanipulated plumage, females did not hop more frequently (12.1 &plusmn; 1.0 vs. 10.7 &plusmn; 1.1 hops min<sup>&minus;1</sup>, <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.35) but had a significantly higher tail-flick rate than males (26.9 &plusmn; 1.8 vs. 21.3 &plusmn; 2.0 tail flicks min<sup>&minus;1</sup>, <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.05). In addition, control females delivered to their nestlings slightly more winged prey (2.8 &plusmn; 0.4 vs. 2.1 &plusmn; 0.4 prey hr<sup>&minus;1</sup>, <italic>F</italic><sub>1,14.2</sub> &equals; 2.0, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.18) and significantly fewer insect larvae (1.0 &plusmn; 0.2 vs. 1.6 &plusmn; 0.3 prey hr<sup>&minus;1</sup>, <italic>F</italic><sub>1,10.1</sub> &equals; 5.8, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.037) than control males. Because breeding males often position themselves in the lower canopy to enhance song transmission, whereas females spend more time in the understory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Chiver1">Chiver et al. 2011</xref>), it is possible that males typically encounter more insect larvae and fewer winged insects than females. These potential sex differences in foraging strategies merit further investigation.A second question that arises from my study is why the significant reduction of foraging performance in experimental birds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-f02">Figure 2</xref>A) did not lead to a significant decrease in provisioning of nestlings. One possibility is that birds with darkened tails may have been able to compensate for reduced effectiveness in flushing and attacking winged prey by either increasing foraging time or shifting to exploit other types of prey. Indeed, the rate at which insect larvae were delivered to nestlings was actually slightly higher for experimental birds than for controls (1.4 &plusmn; 0.2 vs. 1.0 &plusmn; 0.3 larvae min<sup>&minus;1</sup> for females, and 1.8 &plusmn; 0.3 vs. 1.6 &plusmn; 0.2 larvae min<sup>&minus;1</sup> for males), which suggests that such a shift in foraging strategy may well have occurred.Although the results presented here strongly support the hypothesis that white tail spots enhance foraging performance, they are silent on the question of whether tail spots in Hooded Warblers may also have other important functions, including a role in social or sexual signaling. In particular, the sexual dimorphism in tail pattern, with males having slightly more extensive white than females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Curson1">Curson et al. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Chiver1">Chiver et al. 2011</xref>), suggests a potential role for sexual selection in the evolution of white tail spots, as in Dark-eyed Juncos (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Junco hyemalis</named-content></italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Hill1">Hill et al. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-McGlothlin1">McGlothlin et al. 2007</xref>) and other birds in which tail ornaments have been identified as targets of sexual selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Kose1">Kose et al. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Reudink1">Reudink et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Griggio1">Griggio et al. 2011</xref>). Nonetheless, it is important to note that plausible alternative hypotheses that do not rely on sexual selection could also explain the evolution of a sexually dimorphic tail pattern in Hooded Warblers.One such alternative is based on the sexual habitat segregation shown by Hooded Warblers on their Central American wintering grounds: Males winter primarily in closed-canopy forest, whereas females typically inhabit open scrub habitat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Lynch1">Lynch et al. 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Morton2">Morton et al. 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Morton1">Morton 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Stutchbury1">Stutchbury 1994</xref>). It is therefore possible that selection for optimal foraging performance on the wintering ground has produced larger tail spots in males because tails with extensive white are typically more effective at flushing potential prey in dark forested habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-2-141-Jablonski3">Jab&lstrok;o&nacute;ski et al. 2006</xref>). A second alternative hypothesis is based on the apparent sexual differences in foraging strategies on the breeding grounds (discussed above), and the possibility that white tail spots may have slightly different roles in the foraging behavior of males and females. Additional work is needed to discriminate among these alternatives and determine whether the sexual dimorphism in tail pattern of Hooded Warblers is a result of sexual selection on the breeding grounds, sexual habitat segregation on the wintering grounds, or sexual differences in foraging strategies during nesting.This paper is dedicated to the memory of Russell Greenberg for his many original contributions to ornithology and the study of Neotropical migrants.
