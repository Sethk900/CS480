Tomopteridae (Annelida: Polychaeta) recolectados en el Pacifico Suroriental y revisi√≥n de la familia en ChileThe species of Tomopteridae found in plankton samples collected in the southeast Pacific Ocean off the coast of Chile, between Antofagasta and Valparaiso, are studied. Three species: Enapteris eucheta (Chun), Tomopleris cavallii Rosa, and T. septentrionalis Quatrefages were identified from among the samples analized. The samples were collected with a Bongo net during the day and night at eight different levels between surface and 500 m depth. Enapteris eucheta is registered for the first time in this region. On the basis of the specimens examined here and literature references about tomopterids reported off the Chilean coast and Antarctic the family Tomopteridae has been reviewed and a synoptic characterization of the taxonomic morphology for each species reported is given. A key for the species and a characterization of the family is also provided. Six species of Tomopteridae have been recorded at present in this region; they are: Enapteris eucheta (Chun), Tomopteris carpenterii Quatrefages, T. cavallii Rosa, T. ligulata Rosa, T. planktonis Apstein, and T. septentrionalis Quatrefages.
