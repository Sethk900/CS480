Automated Creation of District Metered Area Boundaries in Water Distribution SystemsAbstractAccounting for water in a distribution system can be improved by dividing systems into smaller, metered zones. This paper proposes an approach that could create boundaries for district metered areas (DMA) automatically on the basis of the community structure of water distribution systems. Community structure—the gathering of vertices into communities such that there is a higher density of edges within communities than between them—is a common property of many complex systems. For verification, the method was tested on a real-world distribution system, and the result was compared with a manually designed DMA layout. Although further improvements are necessary, because the achieved community structure is in excellent agreement with the zoning plan in reality, this approach is a new addition to the number of automated methods aimed at complementing and eventually substituting the empirical trial-and-error approach.
