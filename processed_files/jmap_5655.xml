Breeding biology of Phyllomedusa azurea Cope, 1862 and P. sauvagii Boulenger, 1882 (Anura) from the Cerrado, Central BrazilPhyllomedusa azurea and P. sauvagii are treefrogs from seasonal dry environments of Central Brazil. We report on reproductive and other natural history features of these species. The study was carried out in Serra da Bodoquena, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. The reproductive period was determined by the presence of vocalizing males, amplectant pair or presence of tadpoles. The reproductive effort was measured as the ratio of gonad mass in relation to body mass (BM). The reproduction of both species was correlated with the rainy season. Female P. sauvagii produced more eggs and their eggs were larger than those of P. azurea. Both species showed sexual dimorphism in relation to the snoutâ€“vent length (SVL) and BM. The mating behaviour of both species was similar. Males in both species showed similar reproductive efforts, but females of P. azurea invested more in gonads compared to the males of P. sauvagii. Phyllomedusa azurea showed a significant relation between SVL versus number of the mature eggs (NME), and P. sauvagii between SVL versus NME and BM versus ovarian mass.
