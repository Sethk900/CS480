Effects of root and litter exclusion on soil CO2 efflux and microbial biomass in wet tropical forestsWe examined the effects of root and litter exclusion on the rate of soil CO2 efflux and microbial biomass at a soil depth of 25 cm in a secondary forest (dominated by Tabebuia heterophylla) and a pine (Pints caribaea) plantation in the Luquillo Experimental Forest in Puerto Rico. The experimental plots were initially established in 1990, when root, forest floor mass and new litterfall were excluded for 7 y since then. Soil respiration was significantly reduced in the litter and root exclusion plots in both the secondary forest and the pine plantation compared with the control. Root exclusion had a greater effect on soil CO2 efflux than the litter exclusion in the plantation, whereas a reversed pattern was observed in the secondary forest. The reduction of microbial biomass in the root exclusion plot was greater in the secondary forest (59%) than in the plantation (31%), while there was no difference of the reduction in the litter exclusion plots between these forests. Our results suggest that above-ground input and roots (root litter and exudates) differentially affect soil CO2 efflux under different vegetation types. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
