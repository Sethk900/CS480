Water availability and successful lactation by bats as related to climate change in arid regions of western North America.<ol><li>â€‚Climate change in North America is happening at an accelerated rate, reducing availability of water resources for bats and other wildlife that require it for successful reproduction.</li><li>We test the water-needy lactation hypotheses directly by tracking the drinking habitats of individual lactating and non-reproductive female fringed myotis at an artificial water source located near a maternity roost.</li><li>We used a submerged passive integrative transponder (PIT) tag reader system designed to track fish to instead record numbers of water source visitations by tagged bats.</li><li>Of 24 PIT-tagged adult females, 16 (67%) were detected repeatedly by the plate antenna as they passed to drink between 18 July and 28 August 2006.</li><li>The total number of drinking passes by lactating females (<em>n</em> = 255) were significantly higher than those of non-reproductive adult females (<em>n</em> = 22). Overall, lactating females visited 13 times more often to drink water than did non-reproductive females. On average, lactating females visited six times more often per night. Drinking bouts occurred most frequently just after evening emergence and at dawn.</li><li>Drinking patterns of non-reproductive females correlated significantly with fluctuating ambient temperature and relative humidity recorded at the water source, whereas lactating females drank extensively regardless of ambient conditions.</li><li>We provide a mathematical model to predict the rate of decline in bat populations in the arid West in relation to climate change models for the region.</li></ol>
