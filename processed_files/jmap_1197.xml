Genetic Polymorphism and Transplantation Success in the Mediterranean Seagrass Posidonia oceanica.We studied the role of genetic variability of donor beds in establishing transplantation criteria for the Mediterranean seagrass <em>Posidonia oceanica.</em> Horizontal rhizomes, collected from three geographically distinct populations, were transplanted into a common bed at a highly human-impacted locality. The transplantation site was located near one of the donor populations. After three years, the shoots collected in the population adjacent to the transplanting site showed the lowest growth performance. Genetic variability, assessed through the analysis of hypervariable microsatellite regions, and growth performance followed a similar trend. The shoots growing and branching at the highest rate were those collected from populations with the highest heterozygosity values, despite greater geographic distance. No genetic differences were found between the transplanted shoots and shoots from donor meadows, as expected due to the low rate of sexual reproduction in <em>P. oceanica</em> and the short time that had passed since the transplants. The problem of affecting the local gene pool by the introduction of foreign genotypes could arise, but introduction of new alleles could balance the degradation of genetic variability caused by human impact. In general our study suggests that the genetic variability of source material is an important aspect to consider in the development of seagrass restoration strategies.
