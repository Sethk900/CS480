LEAF-AREA INDEX AND LIGHT ATTENUATION IN RAPIDLY EXPANDING SHRUB THICKETS.There is increasing interest in the changes in ecosystem services that accompany the conversion of grasslands to shrub-dominated communities. Shrub structure and associated effects on the light environment may be especially important in affecting productivity and diversity. Leaf-area index (LAI) and understory light levels of <em>Morella cerifera</em> shrub thickets were assessed on Hog Island, Virginia, USA, at four sites along a soil chronosequence. LAI was estimated from annual leaf litter, with allometric models relating stem diameter to leaf area, with a portable integrating radiometer (LI-COR LAI-2000), and from photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) using the Beer-Lambert law. For the two youngest thickets, LAI estimates from leaf litter (10.0) approached levels often associated with tropical rain forest. Allometric models estimated LAI values at 9.8 and 12.5 for the same thickets. High LAI in thickets also results in high light attenuation. Light levels within thickets were as low as 0.7% of above-canopy PAR in the youngest thicket. These data suggest that <em>M. cerifera</em> shrub thickets have a very high potential for annual net primary production. Furthermore, extreme modification of the light environment, coupled with heavy shrub litter fall, may exclude potential competitors during thicket establishment and rapidly alter community structure and ecosystem function.
