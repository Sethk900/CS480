Leaf-mining beetles carry plant pathogenic fungi amongst hostsSome insects carry plant pathogenic fungi amongst plants, and although leaf-mining behaviour in adult insects has only rarely been reported, adults of Phylloplatypus pandani Kato (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea) mine leaves of Pandanus boninensis Warb. (Pandanaceae, Monocotyledonopsida) on the north-western Pacific Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands. Leaf areas surrounding mines change colour to reddish brown, suggesting infection by plant pathogenic fungi. To determine whether P. pandani carries plant pathogens amongst host plants, we isolated fungi from adult beetles and their mines. Seven and nine fungal species were isolated from beetles and from mine interiors, respectively. Fusarium sp., which was the fungus most frequently isolated from both adult beetles and their galleries, was experimentally inoculated into sound leaves of pandanus under field conditions. Fusarium infection increased the areal extent of leaf discolouration, and hence, P. pandani adults were found to be able to transmit fungal pathogens from infected to uninfected leaves.
