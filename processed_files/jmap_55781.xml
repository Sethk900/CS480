The effect of lime and compost amendments on the potential for the revegetation of metal-polluted, acidic soilsThe revegetation of soils affected by the historic pollution of an industrial complex in central Chile was studied. Spontaneous and assisted revegetation and changes in the physicochemical properties of the soils were evaluated in field plots that were amended with lime or lime + compost. Lime had no effect on plant productivity in comparison with the control, whereas the incorporation of lime + compost into the soil increased the plant cover and aboveground biomass. The application of lime + compost increased the plant productivity of Chrysanthemum coronarium (a species sensitive to the atmospheric emissions from the industrial complex), thus showing effective in situ stabilization of soil contaminants. Regression analyses suggested that the plant response was due to the increase in the soil organic matter content rather than to the increase in the soil pH. The aboveground biomass and plant cover did not differ under the spontaneous and assisted revegetation regimes. The native soil seed bank was sufficient for attainment of the proper plant cover and biomass production after the application of the soil amendments. Although the pCu2+ in the amended soils was 4 orders of magnitude higher than in the unamended control, the shoot Cu concentration was similar among most of the combinations of plant species and amendments.
