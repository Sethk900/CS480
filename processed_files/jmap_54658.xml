Characteristics and constituent composition of Harmattan dust falling in Northern NigeriaDuring the 1984–1985 Harmattan season, dustfall was collected at six locations in the Zaria-Kano area of Northern Nigeria. From the beginning of November 1984 to late March 1985 the average dustfall at six locations was 580 kg/ha. The total dustfall during that season may have been of the order of 700–1000 kg/ha. Clay (less than 2 μm) constituted 25% and silt (2–50 μm) 57% of the dust: the rest was very fine sand. The dust had higher pH and cation exchange capacity, and contained more extractable phosphorus, organic matter and exchangeable Ca, Mg, K and Na, but had less extractable A1 and exchangeable acidity than the samples from eight soil profiles with which it was compared. The dust also had a higher content of 2: 1 layer silicate clay minerals and lower amounts of 1: 1 layer silicate clay minerals and Fe-oxyhydroxides than the soil samples. This difference in chemical and physical properties and in constituent composition of the Harmattan dust may be expected to have an impact on the characteristics and development of the soils upon which it is falling.
