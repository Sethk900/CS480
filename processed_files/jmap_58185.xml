How Safe is Hydrologic Infrastructure Design? Analysis of Factors Affecting Extreme Flood EstimationAbstractThis study evaluates the implicit safety level in hydrologic infrastructure design, performed in common practice with the calculation of the peak-flow frequency curve for high return periods (100<return period<10,000  years) through use of single-peak hyetographs in a semidistributed hydro-meteorological event-based model. Through consideration of two basins located in mainland Spain, the paper studies the effect on the peak-flow frequency curve of (1) the shape of the design hyetograph defined by the alternating blocks (AB) method or through applying a Monte Carlo (MC) procedure; (2) the catchment area (ranging from 140 to 1,800  km2); and (3) the extent of disaggregation in the hydro-meteorological model (varying from 14 to 66 subbasins). The effect on hydrologic safety was measured through using the ratio R=QmaxAB/QmaxMC, with QmaxAB, the peak flows obtained with the AB method and QmaxMC, the application of MC. The paper finds the following: (1) that the degree of safety decreases as the basin area increases, regardless of the extent of disaggregation in the model used; (2) a greater disaggregation in semidistributed hydrologic models leads to greater water safety, mainly for smaller basins (in this study, 150  km2); and (3) at the level of subbasin, the degree of safety decreases as the time of concentration and area increase.
