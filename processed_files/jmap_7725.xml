El género Perinereis (Annelida, Polychaeta, Nereidae) en ChileSummary The present work is a systematic study of the species oí Perinereis in Chile. A new species, P. longidonta n.sp. is described. The characterizations were based on material collected by the authors (P. falklandica, P. longidonta n.sp., P. nuntia var. vallata) and specimens deposited in the U.S. National Museum, Smithsonian Institution, collected in Easter Island and Juan Fernández archipelago (P. helleri, P. camiguinoides). The characterization of P. pseudocamiguina is taken from the literature, since specimens were not available. P. gualpensis Jeldes 1963 is probably related to P. nuntia var. vallata but it was not possible to compare them due to lack of material. A key for the 6 valid species of Perinereis in Chile is included: P. camiguinoides, P. falklandica, P. helleri, P. longidonta n.sp., P. nuntia var. vallata, and P. pseudocamiguina.
