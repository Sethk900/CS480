Diet of the desert lizard Liolaemus pseudoanomalus (Iguania: Liolaemini) in northern La Rioja Province, Argentina.The diet of a species can help us to understand its natural history, ecological requirements, and strategies involved in searching for food. Liolaemus pseudoanomalus is a rare desert lizard where previous studies showed no seasonal, ontogenetic or sexual differences observed in microhabitat use; however the sexual dimorphism is evident in the number of precloacal pores and in the snout-vent length. In this work, we investigate if there are differences in the diet composition between sexes and age groups. Herein we describe the diet of L. pseudoanomalus, of the Central West Monte desert of Argentina, based on the analysis of 63 stomach contents. We found that ants are the most important food item and some characteristics of foraging behavior suggest similarities with other ant-eating lizards.
