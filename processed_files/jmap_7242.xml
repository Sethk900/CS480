A new record of the Armadillo Chaetophractus vellerosus (Gray, 1865) (Mammalia, Dasypodidae) in the Buenos Aires Province of Argentine: Possible Causes for the Disjunct DistributionSpecimens of Chaetophractus vellerosus are recorded for the first time in Eastern Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. This occurrence is interpreted as a relict of a wider distribution resulting from different climatic conditions during the Late Pleistocene and part of the Holocene. Recent soil conditions and physiologic adaption could be responsible of this disjunctive distribution.
