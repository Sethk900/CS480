New Stage-Discharge Relationship for Weirs of Finite Crest LengthAbstractThe flow process of weirs of finite crest length is analyzed on the basis of the dimensional analysis and incomplete self-similarity theory. The crest length is incorporated in the functional stage-discharge relationship for weirs of finite crest length. The theoretically deduced stage-discharge formula was then calibrated using the experimental data compiled in this research. According to the current experimental data it is also concluded that the performance of the proposed stage-discharge formula is better than the previous dimensional stage-discharge formulae. Also, the proposed stage-discharge formula is applicable for all types of the weirs, i.e.,Â long-crested, broad-crested, short-crested, and sharp-crested ones.
