New troglobitic species of the genus Troglocheles (Acari: Prostigmata: Rhagidiidae) from caves in northern Italy and Austria, with a key to adult species of the genusThree new troglobitic species of rhagidiid mites of the genus Troglocheles – two from northern Italy, Troglocheles quinquesolenidiata sp. nov. and T. lanai sp. nov., and T. christiani sp. nov. from Austria – are described. A key to adults of the known species of the genus Troglocheles Zacharda of the world is given. In these vicariant species the different apomorphic morphological traits, troglomorphisms, are discussed in aspects of allopatric speciation, climatic relict hypothesis and evolutionary processes of adaptation to specific niches and time of occupation of the subterranean habitat. All new taxa are authored by M. Zacharda only.
