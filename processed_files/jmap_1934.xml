Gypsy moth feeding in the canopy of a CO2-enriched mature forest.Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentration is expected to change plant tissue quality with important implications for plant-insect interactions. Taking advantage of canopy access by a crane and long-term CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment (530 &mu; mol mol<sup>-;1</sup>) of a natural old-growth forest (web-free air carbon dioxide enrichment), we studied the responses of a generalist insect herbivore feeding in the canopy of tall trees. We found that relative growth rates (RGR) of gypsy moth (<em>Lymantria dispar</em>) were reduced by 30% in larvae fed on high CO<sub>2</sub>-exposed <em>Quercus petraea</em>, but increased by 29% when fed on high CO<sub>2</sub>-grown <em>Carpinus betulus</em> compared with control trees at ambient CO<sub>2</sub> (370 &mu; mol mol<sup>-;1</sup>). In <em>Fagus sylvatica</em>, there was a nonsignificant trend for reduced RGR under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Tree species-specific changes in starch to nitrogen ratio, water, and the concentrations of proteins, condensed and hydrolyzable tannins in response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> were identified to correlate with altered RGR of gypsy moth larvae. Our data suggest that rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> will have strong species-specific effects on leaf chemical composition of canopy trees in natural forests leading to contrasting responses of herbivores such as those reported here. A future change in host tree preference seems likely with far-ranging consequences for forest community dynamics.
