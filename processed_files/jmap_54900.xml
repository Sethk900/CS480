The traditional farming system of a Mexican indigenous community: the case of Nuevo San Juan Parangaricutiro, Michoac√°n, MexicoThe objective of this paper is twofold: first, to describe the dynamics of the traditional farming system (TFS) of a rural indigenous community in Central Mexico and second, to detect the contribution of local knowledge to potential indicators of sustainable development. The method included the following steps: (a) field description of the TFS; (b) survey of local knowledge on both landscape and land qualities; (c) soil and maize grain yield sampling; and (d) statistical analyses relating local knowledge to field and laboratory data. A participatory approach was used; every field technique was carried out together with local producers. Statistical analyses of both field and laboratory data proved the consistency of peasant-defined land quality classes. Land quality was related to the distribution of available P, slope position and depth of recent volcanic ash cover. In addition, we detected a well-structured relief and soil quality knowledge-base. The TFS is a highly complex integrated scheme serving as a conceptual basis for decision-making procedures. The TFS does not attempt to maximize profit in cash. Its goal is self-sufficiency. These principles are at the core of decision-making procedures. The system represents a substantial part of the culture of Nuevo San Juan traditional producers. Family participation in the TFS is a key element; self-sufficiency gives security to the family. This explains the survival of the TFS despite its drawbacks, basically of a social nature rather than a technical nature.
