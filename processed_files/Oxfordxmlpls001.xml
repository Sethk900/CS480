The accessions were clustered in nine groups, each of which was mainly composed of only one of the four botanical varieties.The botanical classification of <italic>Stylosanthes guianensis</italic> is controversial, and few studies have used molecular markers to analyse this species. We used microsatellite markers to study the genetic diversity and population structure of <italic>S. guianensis</italic> and compare our results with the current infraspecific botanical classification.A representative sample from the <italic>S. guianensis</italic> Brazilian germplasm collection (150 accessions) was analysed using 20 microsatellite loci. A model-based Bayesian approach implemented in the software STRUCTURE was used to assign accessions into clusters. A dendrogram was constructed based on Roger's genetic distances.The number of alleles per locus varied from 2 to 11, with an average of 4.7. The observed (<italic>H</italic><sub>O</sub>) and expected (<italic>H</italic><sub>E</sub>) heterozygosity values varied from 0 to 0.58 (mean of 0.18) and from 0.04 to 0.83 (mean of 0.55), respectively. Nine groups were assembled in STRUCTURE, and these groups were consistent with clusters inferred from the genetic distances and taxonomic varieties described for <italic>S. guianensis</italic>. The <italic>G</italic><sub>ST</sub> among the nine groups was 0.46.The low <italic>H</italic><sub>O</sub> and the <italic>G</italic><sub>ST</sub> values observed are in agreement with the outcrossing rate (26 %) estimated for this species. The data indicate a high genetic diversity among and within the botanical varieties and suggest that microsatellite-based information can be combined with classical taxonomy to elucidate infraspecific levels.The genus <italic>Stylosanthes</italic> belongs to the family Fabaceae and consists of 48 species found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, Africa and Southeast Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C5">Costa and Ferreira 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C4">Costa 2006</xref>). The genus has two centres of diversity, the most important being located in central Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C10">Ferreira and Costa 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C32">Stace and Cameron 1984</xref>). It includes 45 % of all <italic>Stylosanthes</italic> species and exhibits the greatest degree of phenotypic variation and endemism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C4">Costa 2006</xref>). Mexico and the Caribbean Islands are also major centres of <italic>Stylosanthes</italic> diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C32">Stace and Cameron 1984</xref>).<italic>Stylosanthes guianensis</italic> (Aubl.) Sw. (2<italic>n</italic>= 20) is the most widespread <italic>Stylosanthes</italic> species and exhibits great phenotypic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C39">Williams <italic>et al</italic>. 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C37">Vieira <italic>et al</italic>. 1993</xref>). This species is native to South and Central America, where it is widely distributed, although not in the equatorial zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C39">Williams <italic>et al</italic>. 1984</xref>). <italic>Stylosanthes guianensis</italic> is considered to be a promising forage crop in the Brazilian savannahs, and many accessions produce a large amount of dry matter and retain their leaves during the dry season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C1">Andrade and Karia 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C17">Maass and Sawkins 2004</xref>).The taxonomic classification of <italic>S. guianensis</italic> is controversial, and different taxonomic groups have been proposed based on different morphological characters. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C19">Mannetje (1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C20">1984</xref>) recognized seven different <italic>S. guianensis</italic> varieties: <italic>S. guianensis</italic> var. <italic>dissitiflora, S. guianensis</italic> var. <italic>gracilis</italic>, <italic>S. guianensis</italic> var. <italic>guianensis</italic>, <italic>S. guianensis</italic> var. <italic>intermedia</italic>, <italic>S. guianensis</italic> var. <italic>longiseta</italic>, <italic>S. guianensis</italic> var. <italic>marginata</italic> and <italic>S. guianensis</italic> var. <italic>robusta</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C10">Ferreira and Costa (1979)</xref> considered Mannetje's varieties to be different species.

More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C4">Costa (2006)</xref> used ITS sequencing and classical taxonomy to review the genus <italic>Stylosanthes.</italic> The ITS data support the classification proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C10">Ferreira and Costa (1979)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C3">Brandão <italic>et al</italic>.

Their results demonstrate that the varieties proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C10">Ferreira and Costa (1979)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C3">Brandão <italic>et al.</italic> (1985)</xref> have similar karyotypes, suggesting that <italic>S. g. canescens</italic>, <italic>S. g. microcephala</italic> and <italic>S. g. pauciflora</italic> may all have evolved from <italic>S. g. guianensis</italic>. The four species considered to be <italic>S. guianensis</italic> varieties by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C19">Mannetje (1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C20">1984</xref>) have distinct karyotypes, supporting the classification proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C10">Ferreira and Costa (1979)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C3">Brandão <italic>et al.</italic> (1985)</xref>.Microsatellites, or simple sequence repeats (SSRs), are useful markers for a variety of applications in plant genetics because they are codominant, multiallelic, easily detected by polymerase chain reaction, relatively abundant and provide good coverage of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C23">Powell <italic>et al</italic>. 1996<italic>a</italic></xref>). Microsatellite markers are available for three species of <italic>Stylosanthes</italic>: <italic>S. guianensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C34">Vander Stappen <italic>et al</italic>. 1999<italic>a</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C27">Santos <italic>et al</italic>. 2009<italic>a</italic></xref>), <italic>S. capitata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C28">Santos <italic>et al</italic>. 2009<italic>b</italic></xref>) and <italic>S. macrocephala</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C29">Santos <italic>et al</italic>. 2009<italic>c</italic></xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C34">Vander Stappen <italic>et al</italic>. (1999<italic>a</italic>)</xref> described 18 genomic microsatellites in <italic>S. guianensis</italic> and tested them in 65 genotypes of <italic>S. guianensis</italic> and in the related species <italic>S. gracilis</italic>, <italic>S. hippocampoides</italic>, <italic>S. grandifolia</italic>, <italic>S. acuminata</italic> and <italic>S. longiseta</italic>. All 18 microsatellites were polymorphic among <italic>S. guianensis</italic> and its related species, and 16 were polymorphic within <italic>S. guianensis</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C13">Karia (2008)</xref> tested the microsatellites developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C34">Vander Stappen <italic>et al</italic>. (1999<italic>a</italic>)</xref> to evaluate the relationships among 437 accessions of the <italic>S. guianensis</italic> Brazilian germplasm collection and found that only seven were polymorphic among the accessions. Because of the limited number of markers, many relationships were unclear, and few could be clarified with respect to the population structure and to the clustering of the botanical varieties based on the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C13">Karia (2008)</xref>. Considering the small number of polymorphic microsatellites available for this species and the need to better evaluate the Brazilian germplasm collection, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C27">Santos <italic>et al.</italic> (2009<italic>a</italic>)</xref> developed 46 new genomic microsatellites, 20 of which were polymorphic when tested in 20 <italic>S. guianensis</italic> accessions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C30">Santos-Garcia <italic>et al</italic>.

Based on the microsatellite data, these authors estimated the outcrossing rate in <italic>S. guianensis</italic> to be 26 %, indicating that the species presents a mixed mating system with predominance of autogamy.Despite the importance of <italic>S. guianensis</italic> as forage in tropical areas and the fact that some Brazilian regions contain most of the diversity of this genus, few studies have been conducted to determine the genetic diversity in the Brazilian germplasm collection. The Brazilian <italic>S. guianensis</italic> collection was established in a series of collecting trips around Brazil and other South American countries, and it has not been subjected to any breeding selection. Genetic studies of this collection may provide valuable information for planning new collection trips as well as for the study of natural populations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C13">Karia (2008)</xref> was the first to study this collection using molecular markers, but this analysis did not provide enough information to evaluate the genetic diversity of the collection or to clarify the botanical classifications and the relationships among the accessions.Considering the classifications proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C10">Ferreira and Costa (1979)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C3">Brandão <italic>et al</italic>. (1985)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C4">Costa (2006)</xref>, we have selected a representative sample of the <italic>S. guianensis</italic> Brazilian germplasm collection consisting of 150 accessions that were either classified as one of the four botanical varieties or remained unclassified. We are dealing with botanical varieties of <italic>S. guianensis</italic> in this study, and their classification is still controversial. Currently, microsatellite markers have been the most widely used for inferring population structure that ultimately defines variation at the infraspecific level.Considering that, we used microsatellite markers to analyse the <italic>S. guianensis</italic> accessions with the goals of (i) estimating the genetic diversity and relationships present among the accessions, (ii) determining the population structure of the samples and (iii) comparing the observed population structure to the proposed botanical varieties. The microsatellite-based population structure observed in these samples was generally in agreement with the proposed botanical varieties of <italic>S. guianensis</italic>.<bold>The S. guianensis collection used to assess the genetic diversity at 20 microsatellite loci.</bold> <italic>Shown are the sample codes, the respective accession numbers in the Embrapa Cerrados and CIAT (International Center for Tropical Agriculture) germplasm collections, the geographic collection site and the botanical variety of each accession</italic>.n.a., not available.<sup>a</sup>Geographic sites indicate the Brazilian state or other country where the plant was collected.<sup>b</sup>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C10">Ferreira and Costa (1979)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C3">Brandão <italic>et al</italic>.

(2009<italic>a</italic>)</xref>. Amplified fragments were separated on 6 % acrylamide gels and visualized by silver staining according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C6">Creste <italic>et al</italic>. (2001)</xref>.The Genetic Data Analysis program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C16">Lewis and Zaykin 2000</xref>) was used to estimate the observed and expected heterozygosities. Allele frequencies and Roger's genetic distance, as modified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C40">Wright (1978)</xref>, were estimated between all pairs of accessions using Tools for Population Genetic Analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C21">Miller 1997</xref>).The STRUCTURE software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C26">Pritchard <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>) was used to subdivide the accessions into the appropriate number of genetic clusters independent of any prior information concerning the geographic origin of the accessions. STRUCTURE uses a Bayesian approach to identify clusters based on their fit to Hardy–Weinberg proportions and their linkage equilibria. Ten STRUCTURE runs were performed by setting the number of populations (<italic>K</italic>) from 1 to 20. For each run, the burn-in time was set to 200 000, and the replication number was set to 300 000. The most likely number of distinct clusters (<italic>K</italic>) was determined according to the procedure described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C8">Evanno <italic>et al</italic>.

A graphical representation of the population assignments obtained from STRUCTURE was generated using R v.2.9.1.DARwin 5.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C25">Perrier and Jacquemoud-Collet 2006</xref>) was used to define the genetic relationships among accessions based on Roger's genetic distance and the UPGMA (unweighted paired group method) clustering method. FSTAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C11">Goudet 2001</xref>) was used to estimate Nei's <italic>G</italic><sub>ST</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C22">Nei 1973</xref>) among the groups obtained by the STRUCTURE analysis.<bold>The results of the analysis of 150 accessions of <italic>S. guianensis</italic> using 20 microsatellite loci</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C27">Santos <italic>et al.</italic> 2009<italic>a</italic></xref>). Shown are the locus names, primer sequences, repeat motifs, number of alleles per locus (<italic>A</italic>), observed heterozygosity (<italic>H</italic><sub>O</sub>) and expected (<italic>H</italic><sub>E</sub>) heterozygosity.The observed and expected heterozygosity values (<italic>H</italic><sub>O</sub> and <italic>H</italic><sub>E</sub>) ranged from 0.00 to 0.58 (mean of 0.18) and from 0.04 to 0.83 (mean of 0.55), respectively. The markers with a higher observed heterozygosity were SG01D7 and SG01B9. In the case of bulk samples, a heterozygous pattern may be observed as a result of the presence of heterozygous plants in the DNA pool or variation within the accession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C41">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>).Roger's genetic distances were estimated for each pair of accessions and varied from 0.00 (among several accessions) to 0.94 (between accessions 19 and 140), with an average of 0.66.<bold>(A) The Roger's genetic distance dendrogram of 150 <italic>S. guianensis</italic> accessions constructed using the UPGMA method implemented in DARwin</bold>.

Shown are the percentage of individuals belonging to each botanical variety that are assigned to each of the nine groups and the number of individuals assigned to each group with &gt;80 % membership probability (in bold).The 15 <italic>S. g. microcephala</italic> were mostly clustered in Groups D and E, both with six accessions. Group D contained six accessions belonging to <italic>S. g. microcephala</italic> and two non-classified accessions, and Group E contained six accessions belonging to <italic>S. g. microcephala</italic>, one accession from <italic>S. g. pauciflora</italic> and three non-classified accessions. Of the remaining three <italic>S. g. microcephala</italic> accessions, two were assigned to Group I and one to Group A.The <italic>S. g. canescens</italic> accessions were clustered in a distinct Group (F) composed exclusively of this variety. Of the 20 <italic>S. g. canescens</italic> accessions studied, 14 were assigned to Group F.In the dendrogram constructed using DARwin and the UPGMA method (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS001F1">1</xref>A), the clusters, with few exceptions, were consistent with the groups generated using the Bayesian approach in STRUCTURE. The same dendrogram labelled with the sample code for the accessions is provided in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/pls001/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Supplementary Figure S2 [see Additional Information]</ext-link>.The genetic differentiation among the <italic>S. guianensis</italic> groups, as clustered by the Bayesian approach, was estimated based on Nei's <italic>G</italic><sub>ST</sub> as 0.46, indicating that 46 % of differences resulted from the variation among groups. The remaining 54 % was a function of the genetic variation within groups.All 20 microsatellite markers from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C27">Santos <italic>et al</italic>. (2009<italic>a</italic>)</xref> were polymorphic among the 150 accessions analysed. The same set of microsatellite markers was tested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C30">Santos-Garcia <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>), but only three were found to be polymorphic in that study, probably because the previous study was based on samples from breeding material, and many of the genotypes were closely related. In contrast, we have studied a diverse germplasm collection of accessions obtained in collecting trips around Brazil and other countries in South America.The mean number of alleles per locus observed in this study (4.7) was higher than that reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C34">Vander Stappen <italic>et al</italic>. (1999<italic>a</italic>)</xref> for 65 <italic>S. guianensis</italic> genotypes and some related species but lower than that observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C13">Karia (2008)</xref> among 437 <italic>S. guianensis</italic> accessions; those authors reported mean numbers of alleles per locus of 3.7 and 6.43, respectively. These differences can be attributed to the number of accessions studied by each of the authors.Considering the observed and expected heterozygosities, our data revealed a deficit in heterozygosity that was consistent with the <italic>S. guianensis</italic> outcrossing rate (26 %) that was estimated based on microsatellite data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C30">Santos-Garcia <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). The predominance of autogamy reduced the number of heterozygous samples, but some heterozygosity was maintained as a result of the 26 % outcrossing.The genetic distances found among the studied accessions were higher than those previously reported for the species. The highest genetic distance (0.94) was observed between accessions 19 and 140. Accession 19 belongs to <italic>S. g. pauciflora</italic> and was collected in Venezuela; accession 140 belongs to <italic>S. g. guianensis</italic> and was collected in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. Accession 140 was one of the most divergent, and its mean genetic distance (0.75) is greater than the overall mean genetic distance (0.66). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C14">Kazan <italic>et al</italic>. (1993)</xref> studied 31 <italic>S. guianensis</italic> accessions and observed a mean genetic distance of 0.26 using RAPD. Faleiro <italic>et al</italic>. (2003) also used RAPD to study 35 accessions and observed genetic distances varying from 0.04 to 0.54. Microsatellite markers are codominant and multiallelic with a high degree of polymorphism, making them more useful than dominant markers for revealing diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C15">Laborda <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C24">Powell <italic>et al</italic>. (1996<italic>b</italic>)</xref> compared the expected heterozygosities and the estimated genetic similarities based on different molecular marker types for the evaluation of a set of soybean accessions. Their results show that microsatellites have higher expected heterozygosity (0.61) and lower estimated genetic similarities (0.45) among accessions relative to RAPD markers (0.31 and 0.72, respectively).STRUCTURE analysis was performed to investigate the population structure in the germplasm collection to compare the genetic population structure with the described botanical varieties. The nine groups generated based on microsatellite analysis were mostly consistent with the botanical classification. The <italic>S. g. microcephala</italic> and <italic>S. g. canescens</italic> varieties were well differentiated and formed individual groups. Although most of the accessions belonging to <italic>S. g. guianensis</italic> and <italic>S. g. pauciflora</italic> formed distinct groups, some of them were mixed together in other groups. These mixed groups generally contained small numbers of individuals, many of which were not classified into varieties. <italic>Stylosanthes g. pauciflora</italic> was recognized as a new botanical variety in 1985 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C3">Brandão <italic>et al</italic>. 1985</xref>); the three other varieties were recognized in 1979 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C10">Ferreira and Costa 1979</xref>). This may have affected the classification process, and some of the accessions belonging to <italic>S. g. pauciflora</italic> may have been incorrectly classified as <italic>S. g. guianensis</italic>.In previous studies, most <italic>S. g. microcephala</italic> accessions did not group together (Faleiro <italic>et al</italic>. 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C13">Karia 2008</xref>). In the present work, these samples clustered into two diverse groups. Of the 15 <italic>S. g. microcephala</italic> accessions, five from the state of Minas Gerais were assigned to Group D, and six accessions (two from the state of Goiás and four from the state of Tocantins) were assigned to Group E. In both groups, the majority of the accessions were <italic>S. g. microcephala</italic>. The soil in Goiás and Tocantins is considered less fertile than the soil in Minas Gerais, and this difference in soil fertility may be the main driver of the observed genetic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C13">Karia 2008</xref>). Our data reinforce the idea that the presence of <italic>S. g. microcephala</italic> in Minas Gerais is associated with more fertile soils, as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C4">Costa (2006)</xref>. However, further studies are necessary to address this question and should include the collection and analysis of more plants from those regions. If genetic differentiation based on soil conditions is confirmed by further studies, this information could be useful for the development of new commercial varieties that are adapted to specific soil conditions.The relative lengths and arm ratios of the chromosomes in S. guianensis varieties (modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C37">Vieira et al. 1993</xref>).<bold>Ideograms of <italic>S. guianensis</italic> varieties</bold>. The chromosome measurements were obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C37">Vieira <italic>et al.</italic> (1993)</xref>.The <italic>G</italic><sub>ST</sub> observed in the present study was higher than that observed with allozymes in plants that exhibit a mixed mating system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C12">Hamrick and Godt 1996</xref>), probably because autogamy is predominant in <italic>S. guianensis</italic> (26 % of outcrossing, as described above). In general, <italic>G</italic><sub>ST</sub> values in autogamous or predominantly autogamous species are higher than those in allogamous species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C12">Hamrick and Godt 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C18">Maki <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>). High variation values (30 %) were observed between groups of Mexican and South American accessions of <italic>Stylosanthes humilis</italic> using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C36">Vander Stappen <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>). The variation was even higher in AFLP studies of <italic>S. humilis</italic> (59 %) and <italic>S. viscosa</italic> (66 %) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C31">Sawkins <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>).<italic>Stylosanthes g. microcephala</italic> and <italic>S. g. guianensis</italic> were distributed in more than one group of the STRUCTURE analysis. The genetic differentiation (<italic>G</italic><sub>ST</sub>) between the groups formed by <italic>S. g. microcephala</italic> was low (18 %) and, as discussed above, may be related to the soil conditions. However, the genetic differentiation among the three clusters formed mostly by the <italic>S. g. guianensis</italic> variety was 49 %, which is similar to the overall <italic>G</italic><sub>ST</sub> (46 %). Because most of the accessions from this variety that were included in this study were collected in the same Brazilian state, no conclusion can be drawn about the correlation between these data and the geographic origin of the accessions. More botanical and genetic studies of this variety should be conducted to determine whether it should be subdivided into multiple varieties based on the existing variation.The accessions that were not classified into botanical varieties were randomly distributed in the genetic groups. Although groups were generally dominated by one botanical variety under both clustering methods (STRUCTURE and UPGMA), some superposition was observed. Considering these facts, the classification of individuals in each botanical variety based exclusively on the genetic groups cannot be accomplished with confidence, showing that taxonomic information is fundamental for correct classification. The consistency between the molecular analysis and botanical classification could be increased by the analysis of a larger number of microsatellite markers.This study has revealed valuable information about the relationships among a large number of <italic>S. guianensis</italic> accessions, showing a population structure that is generally consistent with the taxonomic classification proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C10">Ferreira and Costa (1979)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C3">Brandão <italic>et al</italic>. (1985)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS001C4">Costa (2006)</xref>. These data show that molecular markers such as microsatellites can provide complementary information to address botanical questions at the infraspecific level. These data are important for existing germplasm conservation efforts and will help in planning new collecting trips and studies of natural populations of <italic>S. guianensis</italic> in its diversity centre. Moreover, information about the genetic diversity of germplasm collections is essential for their use in breeding programmes, mainly in guiding controlled crosses, as well as for the identification of natural and induced hybrids, and for monitoring the variability in subsequent generations.<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/pls001/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">The following additional information is available in the online version of this article –</ext-link><bold>File 1.</bold> Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS001F1">1:</xref> The bar plot obtained from the model-based ancestry analysis of the <italic>S. guianensis</italic> accessions implemented in the STRUCTURE software.
