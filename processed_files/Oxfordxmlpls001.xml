Molecular genetic diversity and population structure analysis were used to clarify the controversial botanical classification of  Stylosanthes guianensis . The accessions were clustered in nine groups, each of which was mainly composed of only one of the four botanical varieties.  The botanical classification of  Stylosanthes guianensis  is controversial, and few studies have used molecular markers to analyse this species. We used microsatellite markers to study the genetic diversity and population structure of  S. guianensis  and compare our results with the current infraspecific botanical classification.  A representative sample from the  S. guianensis  Brazilian germplasm collection (150 accessions) was analysed using 20 microsatellite loci. A model-based Bayesian approach implemented in the software STRUCTURE was used to assign accessions into clusters. A dendrogram was constructed based on Roger's genetic distances.  The number of alleles per locus varied from 2 to 11, with an average of 4.7. The observed ( H  O ) and expected ( H  E ) heterozygosity values varied from 0 to 0.58 (mean of 0.18) and from 0.04 to 0.83 (mean of 0.55), respectively. Nine groups were assembled in STRUCTURE, and these groups were consistent with clusters inferred from the genetic distances and taxonomic varieties described for  S. guianensis . The  G  ST  among the nine groups was 0.46.  The low  H  O  and the  G  ST  values observed are in agreement with the outcrossing rate (26 %) estimated for this species. The data indicate a high genetic diversity among and within the botanical varieties and suggest that microsatellite-based information can be combined with classical taxonomy to elucidate infraspecific levels.  The genus  Stylosanthes  belongs to the family Fabaceae and consists of 48 species found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, Africa and Southeast Asia ( Costa and Ferreira 1984 ;  Costa 2006 ). The genus has two centres of diversity, the most important being located in central Brazil ( Ferreira and Costa 1979 ;  Stace and Cameron 1984 ). It includes 45 % of all  Stylosanthes  species and exhibits the greatest degree of phenotypic variation and endemism ( Costa 2006 ). Mexico and the Caribbean Islands are also major centres of  Stylosanthes  diversity ( Stace and Cameron 1984 ).   Stylosanthes guianensis  (Aubl.) Sw. (2 n = 20) is the most widespread  Stylosanthes  species and exhibits great phenotypic variation ( Williams  et al . 1984 ;  Vieira  et al . 1993 ). This species is native to South and Central America, where it is widely distributed, although not in the equatorial zone ( Williams  et al . 1984 ).  Stylosanthes guianensis  is considered to be a promising forage crop in the Brazilian savannahs, and many accessions produce a large amount of dry matter and retain their leaves during the dry season ( Andrade and Karia 2000 ;  Maass and Sawkins 2004 ).  The taxonomic classification of  S. guianensis  is controversial, and different taxonomic groups have been proposed based on different morphological characters.  Mannetje (1977 ,  1984 ) recognized seven different  S. guianensis  varieties:  S. guianensis  var.  dissitiflora, S. guianensis  var.  gracilis ,  S. guianensis  var.  guianensis ,  S. guianensis  var.  intermedia ,  S. guianensis  var.  longiseta ,  S. guianensis  var.  marginata  and  S. guianensis  var.  robusta .  Ferreira and Costa (1979)  considered Mannetje's varieties to be different species. They proposed that  S. guianensis  was composed of the Mannetje  S. guianensis  var.  guianensis  but subdivided this species into four different botanical varieties. Analyses of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers ( Kazan  et al . 1993 ;  Vieira  et al . 1997 ), sequence-tagged site and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences ( Vander Stappen  et al . 1998 ,  1999 b  ) demonstrated a high genetic diversity among the varieties proposed by  Mannetje (1984) , supporting their separation into distinct species. More recently,  Costa (2006)  used ITS sequencing and classical taxonomy to review the genus  Stylosanthes.  The ITS data support the classification proposed by  Ferreira and Costa (1979)  and  Brandão  et al . (1985) , according to whom there are four botanical varieties of  S. guianensis :  S. guianensis  var.  guianensis ,  S. guianensis  var.  canescens ,  S. guianensis  var.  microcephala  and  S. guianensis  var.  pauciflora .   Vieira  et al . (1993)  analysed the karyotypes of the botanical varieties described by  Ferreira and Costa (1979)  and  Brandão  et al.  (1985) , and four species considered to be  S. guianensis  varieties by  Mannetje (1977 ,  1984 ). Their results demonstrate that the varieties proposed by  Ferreira and Costa (1979)  and  Brandão  et al.  (1985)  have similar karyotypes, suggesting that  S. g. canescens ,  S. g. microcephala  and  S. g. pauciflora  may all have evolved from  S. g. guianensis . The four species considered to be  S. guianensis  varieties by  Mannetje (1977 ,  1984 ) have distinct karyotypes, supporting the classification proposed by  Ferreira and Costa (1979)  and  Brandão  et al.  (1985) .  Microsatellites, or simple sequence repeats (SSRs), are useful markers for a variety of applications in plant genetics because they are codominant, multiallelic, easily detected by polymerase chain reaction, relatively abundant and provide good coverage of the genome ( Powell  et al . 1996 a  ). Microsatellite markers are available for three species of  Stylosanthes :  S. guianensis  ( Vander Stappen  et al . 1999 a  ;  Santos  et al . 2009 a  ),  S. capitata  ( Santos  et al . 2009 b  ) and  S. macrocephala  ( Santos  et al . 2009 c  ).  Vander Stappen  et al . (1999 a )  described 18 genomic microsatellites in  S. guianensis  and tested them in 65 genotypes of  S. guianensis  and in the related species  S. gracilis ,  S. hippocampoides ,  S. grandifolia ,  S. acuminata  and  S. longiseta . All 18 microsatellites were polymorphic among  S. guianensis  and its related species, and 16 were polymorphic within  S. guianensis .  Karia (2008)  tested the microsatellites developed by  Vander Stappen  et al . (1999 a )  to evaluate the relationships among 437 accessions of the  S. guianensis  Brazilian germplasm collection and found that only seven were polymorphic among the accessions. Because of the limited number of markers, many relationships were unclear, and few could be clarified with respect to the population structure and to the clustering of the botanical varieties based on the results of  Karia (2008) . Considering the small number of polymorphic microsatellites available for this species and the need to better evaluate the Brazilian germplasm collection,  Santos  et al.  (2009 a )  developed 46 new genomic microsatellites, 20 of which were polymorphic when tested in 20  S. guianensis  accessions.   Santos-Garcia  et al . (2011)  tested both sets of microsatellites ( Vander Stappen  et al . 1999 a  ;  Santos  et al . 2009 a  ) in 20 accessions that were used as maternal parents in a progeny array and found that only five were polymorphic and could be used to determine the mating system of  S. guianensis . Based on the microsatellite data, these authors estimated the outcrossing rate in  S. guianensis  to be 26 %, indicating that the species presents a mixed mating system with predominance of autogamy.  Despite the importance of  S. guianensis  as forage in tropical areas and the fact that some Brazilian regions contain most of the diversity of this genus, few studies have been conducted to determine the genetic diversity in the Brazilian germplasm collection. The Brazilian  S. guianensis  collection was established in a series of collecting trips around Brazil and other South American countries, and it has not been subjected to any breeding selection. Genetic studies of this collection may provide valuable information for planning new collection trips as well as for the study of natural populations.  Karia (2008)  was the first to study this collection using molecular markers, but this analysis did not provide enough information to evaluate the genetic diversity of the collection or to clarify the botanical classifications and the relationships among the accessions.  Considering the classifications proposed by  Ferreira and Costa (1979) ,  Brandão  et al . (1985)  and  Costa (2006) , we have selected a representative sample of the  S. guianensis  Brazilian germplasm collection consisting of 150 accessions that were either classified as one of the four botanical varieties or remained unclassified. We are dealing with botanical varieties of  S. guianensis  in this study, and their classification is still controversial. Currently, microsatellite markers have been the most widely used for inferring population structure that ultimately defines variation at the infraspecific level.  Considering that, we used microsatellite markers to analyse the  S. guianensis  accessions with the goals of (i) estimating the genetic diversity and relationships present among the accessions, (ii) determining the population structure of the samples and (iii) comparing the observed population structure to the proposed botanical varieties. The microsatellite-based population structure observed in these samples was generally in agreement with the proposed botanical varieties of  S. guianensis .   The S. guianensis collection used to assess the genetic diversity at 20 microsatellite loci.   Shown are the sample codes, the respective accession numbers in the Embrapa Cerrados and CIAT (International Center for Tropical Agriculture) germplasm collections, the geographic collection site and the botanical variety of each accession .  n.a., not available.   a Geographic sites indicate the Brazilian state or other country where the plant was collected.   b According to  Ferreira and Costa (1979)  and  Brandão  et al . (1985) .   c For accessions without a number in the Embrapa Cerrados collection, the identification numbers in other germplasm collections or collector numbers are shown.  DNA was extracted from the bulk leaf samples of four plants per accession using the cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide method ( Doyle and Doyle 1990 ) as modified by  Bellon  et al . (2007) .  Twenty microsatellite loci were amplified from the DNA of all of the sampled accessions as previously described by  Santos  et al . (2009 a ) . Amplified fragments were separated on 6 % acrylamide gels and visualized by silver staining according to  Creste  et al . (2001) .  The Genetic Data Analysis program ( Lewis and Zaykin 2000 ) was used to estimate the observed and expected heterozygosities. Allele frequencies and Roger's genetic distance, as modified by  Wright (1978) , were estimated between all pairs of accessions using Tools for Population Genetic Analysis ( Miller 1997 ).  The STRUCTURE software package ( Pritchard  et al . 2000 ) was used to subdivide the accessions into the appropriate number of genetic clusters independent of any prior information concerning the geographic origin of the accessions. STRUCTURE uses a Bayesian approach to identify clusters based on their fit to Hardy–Weinberg proportions and their linkage equilibria. Ten STRUCTURE runs were performed by setting the number of populations ( K ) from 1 to 20. For each run, the burn-in time was set to 200 000, and the replication number was set to 300 000. The most likely number of distinct clusters ( K ) was determined according to the procedure described by  Evanno  et al . (2005) . A graphical representation of the population assignments obtained from STRUCTURE was generated using R v.2.9.1.  DARwin 5.0 ( Perrier and Jacquemoud-Collet 2006 ) was used to define the genetic relationships among accessions based on Roger's genetic distance and the UPGMA (unweighted paired group method) clustering method. FSTAT ( Goudet 2001 ) was used to estimate Nei's  G  ST  ( Nei 1973 ) among the groups obtained by the STRUCTURE analysis.   The results of the analysis of 150 accessions of  S. guianensis  using 20 microsatellite loci  ( Santos  et al.  2009 a  ). Shown are the locus names, primer sequences, repeat motifs, number of alleles per locus ( A ), observed heterozygosity ( H  O ) and expected ( H  E ) heterozygosity.  The observed and expected heterozygosity values ( H  O  and  H  E ) ranged from 0.00 to 0.58 (mean of 0.18) and from 0.04 to 0.83 (mean of 0.55), respectively. The markers with a higher observed heterozygosity were SG01D7 and SG01B9. In the case of bulk samples, a heterozygous pattern may be observed as a result of the presence of heterozygous plants in the DNA pool or variation within the accession ( Zhang  et al . 2008 ).  Roger's genetic distances were estimated for each pair of accessions and varied from 0.00 (among several accessions) to 0.94 (between accessions 19 and 140), with an average of 0.66.

The colours in the dendrogram indicate the accession's group as assigned by STRUCTURE analysis. (B) The bar plot obtained from the model-based ancestry analysis of the same  S. guianensis  accessions implemented in the STRUCTURE software.   The inferred ancestry of the 150  S. guianensis accessions relative to the groups obtained using STRUCTURE (A-I). Shown are the percentage of individuals belonging to each botanical variety that are assigned to each of the nine groups and the number of individuals assigned to each group with &gt;80 % membership probability (in bold).  The 15  S. g. microcephala  were mostly clustered in Groups D and E, both with six accessions. Group D contained six accessions belonging to  S. g. microcephala  and two non-classified accessions, and Group E contained six accessions belonging to  S. g. microcephala , one accession from  S. g. pauciflora  and three non-classified accessions. Of the remaining three  S. g. microcephala  accessions, two were assigned to Group I and one to Group A.  The  S. g. canescens  accessions were clustered in a distinct Group (F) composed exclusively of this variety. Of the 20  S. g. canescens  accessions studied, 14 were assigned to Group F.  In the dendrogram constructed using DARwin and the UPGMA method (Fig.  1 A), the clusters, with few exceptions, were consistent with the groups generated using the Bayesian approach in STRUCTURE. The same dendrogram labelled with the sample code for the accessions is provided in  Supplementary Figure S2 [see Additional Information] .  The genetic differentiation among the  S. guianensis  groups, as clustered by the Bayesian approach, was estimated based on Nei's  G  ST  as 0.46, indicating that 46 % of differences resulted from the variation among groups. The remaining 54 % was a function of the genetic variation within groups.  All 20 microsatellite markers from  Santos  et al . (2009 a )  were polymorphic among the 150 accessions analysed. The same set of microsatellite markers was tested previously ( Santos-Garcia  et al.  2011 ), but only three were found to be polymorphic in that study, probably because the previous study was based on samples from breeding material, and many of the genotypes were closely related. In contrast, we have studied a diverse germplasm collection of accessions obtained in collecting trips around Brazil and other countries in South America.  The mean number of alleles per locus observed in this study (4.7) was higher than that reported by  Vander Stappen  et al . (1999 a )  for 65  S. guianensis  genotypes and some related species but lower than that observed by  Karia (2008)  among 437  S. guianensis  accessions; those authors reported mean numbers of alleles per locus of 3.7 and 6.43, respectively. These differences can be attributed to the number of accessions studied by each of the authors.  Considering the observed and expected heterozygosities, our data revealed a deficit in heterozygosity that was consistent with the  S. guianensis  outcrossing rate (26 %) that was estimated based on microsatellite data ( Santos-Garcia  et al . 2011 ). The predominance of autogamy reduced the number of heterozygous samples, but some heterozygosity was maintained as a result of the 26 % outcrossing.  The genetic distances found among the studied accessions were higher than those previously reported for the species. The highest genetic distance (0.94) was observed between accessions 19 and 140. Accession 19 belongs to  S. g. pauciflora  and was collected in Venezuela; accession 140 belongs to  S. g. guianensis  and was collected in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. Accession 140 was one of the most divergent, and its mean genetic distance (0.75) is greater than the overall mean genetic distance (0.66).  Kazan  et al . (1993)  studied 31  S. guianensis  accessions and observed a mean genetic distance of 0.26 using RAPD. Faleiro  et al . (2003) also used RAPD to study 35 accessions and observed genetic distances varying from 0.04 to 0.54. Microsatellite markers are codominant and multiallelic with a high degree of polymorphism, making them more useful than dominant markers for revealing diversity ( Laborda  et al . 2005 ).  Powell  et al . (1996 b )  compared the expected heterozygosities and the estimated genetic similarities based on different molecular marker types for the evaluation of a set of soybean accessions. Their results show that microsatellites have higher expected heterozygosity (0.61) and lower estimated genetic similarities (0.45) among accessions relative to RAPD markers (0.31 and 0.72, respectively).  STRUCTURE analysis was performed to investigate the population structure in the germplasm collection to compare the genetic population structure with the described botanical varieties. The nine groups generated based on microsatellite analysis were mostly consistent with the botanical classification. The  S. g. microcephala  and  S. g. canescens  varieties were well differentiated and formed individual groups. Although most of the accessions belonging to  S. g. guianensis  and  S. g. pauciflora  formed distinct groups, some of them were mixed together in other groups. These mixed groups generally contained small numbers of individuals, many of which were not classified into varieties.  Stylosanthes g. pauciflora  was recognized as a new botanical variety in 1985 ( Brandão  et al . 1985 ); the three other varieties were recognized in 1979 ( Ferreira and Costa 1979 ). This may have affected the classification process, and some of the accessions belonging to  S. g. pauciflora  may have been incorrectly classified as  S. g. guianensis .  In previous studies, most  S. g. microcephala  accessions did not group together (Faleiro  et al . 2003;  Karia 2008 ). In the present work, these samples clustered into two diverse groups. Of the 15  S. g. microcephala  accessions, five from the state of Minas Gerais were assigned to Group D, and six accessions (two from the state of Goiás and four from the state of Tocantins) were assigned to Group E. In both groups, the majority of the accessions were  S. g. microcephala . The soil in Goiás and Tocantins is considered less fertile than the soil in Minas Gerais, and this difference in soil fertility may be the main driver of the observed genetic differentiation ( Karia 2008 ). Our data reinforce the idea that the presence of  S. g. microcephala  in Minas Gerais is associated with more fertile soils, as proposed by  Costa (2006) . However, further studies are necessary to address this question and should include the collection and analysis of more plants from those regions. If genetic differentiation based on soil conditions is confirmed by further studies, this information could be useful for the development of new commercial varieties that are adapted to specific soil conditions.  The relative lengths and arm ratios of the chromosomes in S. guianensis varieties (modified from  Vieira et al. 1993 ).   Ideograms of  S. guianensis  varieties . The chromosome measurements were obtained from  Vieira  et al.  (1993) .  The  G  ST  observed in the present study was higher than that observed with allozymes in plants that exhibit a mixed mating system ( Hamrick and Godt 1996 ), probably because autogamy is predominant in  S. guianensis  (26 % of outcrossing, as described above). In general,  G  ST  values in autogamous or predominantly autogamous species are higher than those in allogamous species ( Hamrick and Godt 1996 ;  Maki  et al . 2003 ). High variation values (30 %) were observed between groups of Mexican and South American accessions of  Stylosanthes humilis  using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) ( Vander Stappen  et al . 2000 ). The variation was even higher in AFLP studies of  S. humilis  (59 %) and  S. viscosa  (66 %) ( Sawkins  et al . 2001 ).   Stylosanthes g. microcephala  and  S. g. guianensis  were distributed in more than one group of the STRUCTURE analysis. The genetic differentiation ( G  ST ) between the groups formed by  S. g. microcephala  was low (18 %) and, as discussed above, may be related to the soil conditions. However, the genetic differentiation among the three clusters formed mostly by the  S. g. guianensis  variety was 49 %, which is similar to the overall  G  ST  (46 %). Because most of the accessions from this variety that were included in this study were collected in the same Brazilian state, no conclusion can be drawn about the correlation between these data and the geographic origin of the accessions. More botanical and genetic studies of this variety should be conducted to determine whether it should be subdivided into multiple varieties based on the existing variation.  The accessions that were not classified into botanical varieties were randomly distributed in the genetic groups. Although groups were generally dominated by one botanical variety under both clustering methods (STRUCTURE and UPGMA), some superposition was observed. Considering these facts, the classification of individuals in each botanical variety based exclusively on the genetic groups cannot be accomplished with confidence, showing that taxonomic information is fundamental for correct classification. The consistency between the molecular analysis and botanical classification could be increased by the analysis of a larger number of microsatellite markers.  This study has revealed valuable information about the relationships among a large number of  S. guianensis  accessions, showing a population structure that is generally consistent with the taxonomic classification proposed by  Ferreira and Costa (1979) ,  Brandão  et al . (1985)  and  Costa (2006) . These data show that molecular markers such as microsatellites can provide complementary information to address botanical questions at the infraspecific level. These data are important for existing germplasm conservation efforts and will help in planning new collecting trips and studies of natural populations of  S. guianensis  in its diversity centre. Moreover, information about the genetic diversity of germplasm collections is essential for their use in breeding programmes, mainly in guiding controlled crosses, as well as for the identification of natural and induced hybrids, and for monitoring the variability in subsequent generations.
