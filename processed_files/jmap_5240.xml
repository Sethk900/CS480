Sexual dimorphism in chelicerae, forelegs and palpal traits in two burrowing wolf spiders (Araneae: Lycosidae) with sex-role reversalAllocosa alticeps and Allocosa brasiliensis are two sex-role-reversed spiders. Females locate males and initiate courtship. Copulation occurs inside male burrows and after copulation the males deliver their burrows to the females. We explored the occurrence of differences in morphological traits related to sex roles in both Allocosa species and compared the results with two non-burrowing wolf spiders with typical sex roles. We measured the length of the foreleg's tibia-patella and the chelicerae. Scanning electron micrographs of palpal tarsus distal sections were taken. Males showed higher values than females in all the traits considered. Adult and penultimate males lacked true claws compared with juveniles and females, but showed modified spines. The palpal organ was more proximal to the tibia compared with the non-burrowing lycosids considered in this study. Spines and palpal organ location could be associated with more effective digging. We discuss how natural and sexual selection could interact on morphology in this scenario.
