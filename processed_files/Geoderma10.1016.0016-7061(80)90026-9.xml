McINTOSH  Geology Department, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington (New Zealand) *  (Received August 7, 1979; accepted January 4, 1980)    ABSTRACT    McIntosh, P.D., 1980. Weathering products in Vitrandept profiles under pine and manuka,  New Zealand, Geoderma, 24: 225--239.    Weathering products of Vitrandept profiles on the Kaingaroa plateau, central North  Island, New Zealand, were investigated by analysis of oxalate extracts and by chemical  and mineralogical analysis of clays of selected soil horizons. Comparisons were made be-  tween profiles under a Pinus radiata (D. Don) stand and profiles under an adjacent area of  manuka native scrub, Leptospermum scoparium (Myrtaceae).  Clay fractions (&lt; 2 ,m) of A, horizon under pine had significantly higher SiO2/A1203  mole-ratios (mean SiO2/A1203 = 12.2) than A. horizon under manuka (mean SiO2/A1203 =  7.1). No effect of vegetation on clay fractions of B horizon was evident, these clays hav-  ing much lower SiO2/Al203 mole-ratio (1.5). Oxalate-extractable A1, Fe and Si values of  &lt; 8-ram fractions of A, B and C horizons showed no differences attributable to present  vegetative cover.  SiO~/AI203 mole-ratios of oxalate extracts increased with increasing depth, and paleo-  sols at &gt; 2 m depth under pine had significantly higher SiO2/A1203 mole-ratios in oxalate  extracts (mean SiO2/A1203 = 2.0) than paleosols under manuka (mean SiO2/A1203 = 1.6).  That soil horizons at &gt; 2 m depth are in the zone of resilication is indicated by: (1) the  greater SiO2/A1203 mole-ratios of oxalate extracts of paleosols than surface horizons; (2)  lysimeter leachate composition; and (3) the presence of authigenic halloysite at &gt; 2 m  depth in soil profiles.    INTRODUCTION    Leaching and resilication strongly influence the nature of the clay-sized  weathering products of tephra in temperate environments (Saigusa et al.,  1978). Near the surface of tephra deposits, weathering products are charac-  teristically aUophane and imogolite (Kanno et al., 1968; Yoshinaga and Yama-  guchi, 1970). Resilication processes are favoured by burial ~f tephra to depths  &gt; 2.5 m (Kurahayashi and Tsuchiya, 1961; Mejia et al., 1968; Calhoun et al.,  1972; Saigusa et al., 1978), wet conditions at depth (Dudas and Harward,  1975) and organic matter in the horizon concerned (Kurahayashi and Tsuchi-    *Present address: Invermay Agricultural Research Centre, Mosgiel, New Zealand.    0016-7061/80/0000--0000/$ 02.25 Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company    226    ya, 1961). The weathering product found in the zone of resilication by the  above authors was characteristically halloysite.  Taylor (1933) was one of the first workers in New Zealand to relate tephra  weathering to plant cover; he found that the clay fraction of topsoil (0--7.5  cm) under forest with acid litter had a higher SIO2/A1203 mole ratio (3.6)  than the clay fraction of topsoil under scrub and fern (SIO2/A1203 = 1.3) and  attributed the higher ratio under the former vegetation to the degradation of  amorphous colloids and leaching of AI. Ward (1967), in an investigation of  buried tephras in New Zealand, related the presence of halloysite root pseudo-  morphs to previous presence of kauri (Agathis australis) trees. Other research  on non-tephric parent materials has shown that iron and aluminium tend to  be mobilised near trees with acid litter (Gersper and Holowaychuk, 1970;  Campbell, 1975). Local effects of podzolising species are well illustrated by  the formation of "egg-cup podzols" in New Zealand podocarp forest (Vuce-  tich and Wells, 1978).  This paper describes a study aimed at determining the properties of clay  fractions and oxalate-extractable amorphous components of selected horizons  of soil derived from tephra on the Kaingaroa plateau, central North Island,  New Zealand, and determining the effect, if any, of the introduced conifer  Pinus radiata (D. Don) on such weathering products. The effects of radiata  pine on soil acidity, exchangeable cations, and phosphorus fractions of softs  in the same study area have been considered by McIntosh (1980), and the  properties of the halloysite found in the tephra profiles are detailed by McIn-  tosh (1979).    CHARACTERISTICS OF STUDY AREA    The study area is located in Compartment 336, Kaingaroa Forest, New  Zealand (Fig. 1) at an elevation of 520 m. Mean annual rainfall at the study  area is approximately 1200 mm (Knight, 1974). The vegetation of the study  area consists of a 45-year old stand of radiata pine with a discontinuous un-  derstorey of native shrubs and herbs. Within the pine stand is a small area, ca.  0.2 ha, of manuka (Leptospermum scoparium).  Before planting of exotic conifers in the 1930's the vegetation of the Kain-  garoa plateau consisted of native scrub species dominated by manuka (Ure,  1950). The scrub cover was probably burned intermittently to provide rough  grazing and replaced podocarp forest destroyed by Maori fires in the mid-  nineteenth century (Ure, 1950; Nicholls, 1963; Vucetich and Pullar, 1963).  Further details of climate and vegetation are given by McIntosh (1980).  Rhyolitic deposits from Taupo Volcanic Centre dominate the tephras of  the study area (Vucetich and Pullar, 1973). The Taupo Pumice Formation was  erupted 1800 years B.P. and comprises thin basal lapilli and ash layers (Hate-  pe Lapilli) and Rotongaio Ash overlain by coarse pumice gravel (Taupo Lapilli)  in turn overlain by Upper Taupo Pumice members (Fig. 2). Below the Taupo  Pumice Formation is a sequence of tephras and associated paleosols of which the    227    tephra soil  stratigraphy horizons    Au L.  ,   ~                                       WAIRAPUKAO    ?  ,k,,o~,,;,  .  2..

Tephra stratigraphy from Vucetich  and Pullar (1973).    following were encountered in the present study: Mapara Tephra (2100 years  B.P.), Whakaipo Tephra (2700 years B.P.) and the Waimihia Formation  (3400 years B.P.). Paleosols developed in these tephras, are referred to in this  paper as the Mapara, Whakaipo and Waimihia paleosols, respectively. Podo-  carp forest is likely to have grown on these soils before their burial by later  tephras (McIntosh, 1980).  The softs in the study area were mapped in the Kaingaroa soil set by New  Zealand Soil Bureau (1954), the typifying type being Kaingaroa silty sand, a  very strongly leached yellow-brown pumice soil (New Zealand Soil Bureau,  1968), a Typic Vitrandept, cindery and mesic, in the USDA classification  (Soil Survey Staff, 1975).    228    METHODS    Field sampling    Five pits were dug under the pine stand in Compartment 336, Kaingaroa  Forest (Fig. 1 ) and five pits were also dug in the area of manuka within this  compartment. Pits under pine were located 2--4 m from the nearest living  pine tree in areas with no understorey.  Pits under manuka were located 0.5--2 m from living manuka plants. A de-  scription of one soil profile under each stand is given in the Appendix, and  mean thicknesses of horizons sampled are shown in Fig. 2.  Profiles under pine differed morphologically from those under manuka in  having "bleached" soil volumes of light colour and friable to loose consistence  (Thornton et al., 1956; Vucetich et al., 1960) in and between A and B hori-  zons and in the Rotongaio Ash and paleosols. Such soil volumes contained  visible fungal mycelia and were associated with fine bifurcating pine roots si-  milar to those described by Harley (1969) as mycorrhizal. Pine roots were  found in all horizons under the pine stand, but under manuka roots were con-  fined to Upper Taupo Pumice members.  Soil horizons shown by Knight and Will (1970) to contain nutrients avail-  able to radiata pine, and those which were observed to be penetrated by many  fine pine roots, were sampled for analysis as it was thought that these hori-  zons might be most sensitive to changes brought about by the conifer stand.  Soil horizons developed within the Upper Taupo Pumice members and paleo-  sols were therefore sampled. In addition, the fine-textured Rotongaio Ash  was sampled to investigate the effect of vegetation on a tephra that has not  been exposed to surficial weathering. Clays were extracted from the A ll and  B horizons of soils forming the present ground surface, from a buried tephra  (the Rotongalo Ash) and from a paleosol (the Mapara paleosol). Roots and  lapilli :&gt; 8 mm were removed by hand picking and gentle sieving.    Separation of clays from AI~ and B horizons    The &lt; 63-ttm fraction of each sample was separated from finer material by  washing each sample through a nylon mesh with distilled water. The silt and  clay fraction was dispersed by successive ultrasonic vibration of I min dura-  tion (total 6 min) at 150 Watts using a Branson ultrasonic probe without pre-  vious treatment of samples with hydrogen peroxide. The silt fractions were  separated by centrifuging; clay fractions were decanted, flocculated with  NaC1 solution, washed 3 times in absolute alcohol and 3 times in Analar ace-  tone and dried at 80.    Separation of clays from Rotongaio Ash and Mapara paleosol    Preliminary investigations showed that the ~ 2-pm fractions of the Roton-  gaio Ash and Mapara paleosol were dominated by volcanic glass, making de-    229    tection of clay minerals difficult. The &lt; 1-pm clay fractions rather than the   2-~m clay fractions were therefore separated from these soil horizons by  the method outlined above using appropriate centrifuging times. Clays were  dried at 30C.    Chemical and instrumental methods    Tamm-oxalate-extractable A1, Fe and Si of &lt; 8-mm samples was determin-  ed by the method of Blakemore et al. (1977). Total A1, Fe and Si in clay  fractions was determined by fusing ignited clay samples with sodium hydrox-  ide, dissolving the fused products in water and determining A1, Fe and Si in  solution by the method of Blakemore et al. (1977). Infra-red spectra of the  clay fractions were obtained using KBr discs and a Perkin-Elmer 337 infra-red  spectrometer. Electron micrographs were obtained using a Zeiss EM 95 instru-  ment.    RESULTS AND DISCUSSION    Oxalate extracts    Comparison between horizons under different vegetation. Tamm's acid  oxalate extract gives an indication of the amount of iron and aluminium pre-  sent in soils as amorphous compounds (Saunders, 1968; McKeague et al.,  1971). Mean oxalate extractable A1, Fe and Si values for the five profiles un-  der manuka and the five profiles under pine are given in Fig. 3. There are no  significant differences between oxalate-extractable A1, Fe and Si ~ralues of  horizons under pine compared with respective horizons under manuka. Con-  sidered as a group, however, paleosols under pine have a significantly higher  (P &lt; 0.001) SiOJA1203 mole-ratio (8iO2/A1203 = 2.0) than paleosols under  manuka (SIO2/A1203 = 1.6), a feature possibly related to the lower pH of    paleosols under pine (McIntosh, 1980).

Values of oxalate-extractable A1, and  Fe {Fig. 3), peak in the B horizon, indicating illuviation of A1 and Fe in-  to the B horizon (Saunders, 1968). Si shows a similar pattern. The mean  SIO2/A1203 mole-ratio for B horizons is 1.0; Harada (1955) concluded that  oxalate extracts with a SIO2/A1203 mole ratio of approximately 1 from vol-  canic ash softs near Mt. Daisen, Japan, were indicative of allophane-like com-  plexes in the soil. In contrast, SIO2/A1203 mole-ratios of oxalate extracts of  paleosols are much higher (mean SiO2/A1203 = 1.8) indicating considerable  resilication of amorphous material in buried horizons. Saigusa et al. (1978)  have pointed out that in the zone of resilication in tephra profiles halloysite  can be expected to form from amorphous material with a SiO2/A1203 mole-  ratio of about 2.

In contrast,  B horizon clays show no chemical differences attributable to pine cover. Typ-  ical infra-red traces from clays of AI~ horizons under pine show stronger ab-  sorption in the 2920 cm-~ and 2850--2860 cm-' region due to aliphatic  compounds than the traces from clays of All horizons under manuka and  also have a more intense absorption at 800 cm-1 (Fig. 4), in keeping with the  higher SiO2/A1203 mole-ratio of clays from A~ horizons under pine. Clay  samples showed no peaks attributable to crystalline clay minerals when sub-  jected to X-ray diffraction.    Comparisons between soil horizons. Comparisons of 8iO2/A12Oa mole-ratios  of oxalate extracts of softs with 8iO2/A1~O3 mole-ratios of clay fractions pro-  vides information on the proportions of fine-glass and non-glass amorphous  components in clay fractions (Campbell et al., 1977). SiO2/Al~O3 mole-ratios  of oxalate extracts from B horizon samples (mean SIO2/A1203 = 1; Fig. 3) are  only slightly lower than SIO2/A1203 mole-ratios of the respective clays (mean  SIO2/A1203 = 1.5; Table I). In contrast, SiO~/A1203 mole-ratios of oxalate ex-  tracts from A1, horizon samples (mean SIO2/A1203 = 0.6; Fig. 3) are much  lower than the SIO2/A1203 mole-ratio of respective clays (mean SiO2/A12Oa =  9.6; Table I) indicating that much of the siliceous component of A,, horizon  clays is not extractable by oxalate. The A1, horizon clays show absorption  peaks due to Si--O--Si bonds of tetrahedral silica at 800 cm-', absent from  B-horizon clays; a shoulder at approximately 1200 cm-' in A,1 horizon clays,  attributed to a silica phase of high condensation (Kirkman, 1975), is also ab-  sent from B-horizon clays (Fig. 4). It is inferred that AI~ horizon clays con-  tain two silica phases; one of high condensation (volcanic glass) and one of  low condensation (gel). The B-horizon clays consist mainly of the low con-  densation (gel) phase. The presence of large amounts of volcanic glass, as  well as amorphous masses, in A-horizon clays, was confirmed by electron  microscopy (Fig. 5). Volcanic glass was not observed in clays from B horizons.  The above inferences are in accord with the results of Campbell et al.  (1977) who characterised poorly ordered aluminosilicates of Taupo sandy  silt, a Vitrandept formed in the same parent material as the soil of the present  study. Molar SiO2/A1203 ratios of rhyolitic glass in clay fractions extracted  by these authors were found to be considerably higher than those of a "non-  glass" phase. Clays from B horizons contained substantial amounts of the  "non-glass" phase.  Absorption in the 950--1100 cm-~ region gives information on the proper-  ties of Si--O--Si and Si--O--A1 linkages in silica-alumina gels (Mitchell et al.,  1964). Clays from B horizons show maximum absorption in the 950--1000 cm-'  region, indicating a greater proportion of Si--O--AI bonds in the amorphous  material of B-horizon clays than in Au -horizon clays which show a broad  maximum in the 1050--1100 cm-~ region (Fig. 4). These observations are  consistent with the lower SiO2/A1203 mole-ratio of oxalate extracts of &lt; 8-  mm soil of B horizons.    233    Fig. 5.

Clay fractions of Rotongaio Ash and Mapara paleosol    Comparison between horizons under different vegetation. There were no  significant differences in amounts of &lt; 1-um clay in the Rotongaio Ash and  Mapara paleosol under manuka and pine (Table I). Mineralogical studies using  X-ray diffraction, infra-red spectrometry, differential thermal analysis and  electron-microscope examination demonstrated the presence of halloysite in  the Rotongaio Ash and Mapara paleosol in three profiles under pine and in  one profile under manuka (McIntosh, 1979). From the low dehydroxylation  temperature (475) of the halloysite, the relative strength of infra-red ab-  sorption at 3620 cm-1 over that at 3690 cm-1, and the ill-defined coiled struc  tures of the halloysite in electron micrographs (Fig. 6), McIntosh (1979) con-  cluded that the halloysite was poorly crystalline. Two possible modes of for-  mation of halloysite in the tephra profiles of the Kaingaroaplateau are: (1)  by pre-eruption hydrothermal processes; (2) by authigenic processes in the  tephra profiles. As halloysite of hydrothermal origin is generally well crystal-  lised and has a dehydroxylation temperature of &gt; 550 (Murray et al.,    234    Fig. 6. Electron micrograph of halloysitic clay &lt; 1 #m from the Mapara paleosol under  pine. (Untreated clay supported on collodion film.)    1977), it is concluded that the halloysite found in this study is authigenic.  The presence of allophane in both halloysitic and non-halloysitic clays was in-  dicated by strong absorption due to hydroxyl stretching in the 3450 cm-~ re-  gion in infra-red spectra and the strong dehydration peak at ll0 on DTA  curves.    Comparison between soil horizons. The presence of authigenic halloysite  at depths &gt; 2 m supports the earlier inference, made on the basis of SiO2/  A12Oa mole-ratios of oxalate extracts, that horizons at this depth are in the  zone of resilication as defined by Saigusa et al. (1978). That resilication pro-  cesses favouring production of 1:1 clay minerals are dominant in horizons at  this depth, is also indicated by the mean composition of soil leachate collect-  ed at 3 m depth beneath a pine stand in Kaingaroa Forest by Knight (1974);  the composition falls in the kaolinite stability field (Fig. 7).    235    10  LOG  K/H                            AR  7  6  5  GIBB'ITEKAOL'I'T'~  I    KAOLI                  MONT  \,  5           4         ~            2    - LOG SlO2    Fig. 7.

CONCLUSIONS    In comparison with softs in unplanted areas under manuka, softs under  pine have higher SiO2/Al203 mole-ratios and lower Fe contents in clays of  the AI~ horizon. These properties of clays of the Alt horizon under pine are  attributed to the lower pH of this horizon under pine than under manuka  (McIntosh, 1980), which is likely to have enhanced the mobility of A1 and  Fe (Taylor, 1933; Curtis, 1970).  No detectable influence of present vegetation on the composition of clays  or oxalate extracts of the B horizon was noted. It appears probable that the  characteristics of this horizon described in this paper are chiefly the result of  soil processes that took place under previous podocarp forest cover.  The greater SIO2/A1203 mole-ratios of oxalate extracts from paleosols at  &gt; 2 m depth under pine, the mildly acidic environment (McIntosh, 1980),  and the soil leachate composition under this species (Knight, 1974) should  theoretically provide a favourable environment for crystallisation of 1:1 clay  minerals in these horizons under pine. Both mildly acidic environments and  organic acids have been shown to favour formation of minerals in the kaolinite  group in laboratory studies (De Kimpe et al., 1964; La Iglesia, 1978). Although  halloysite was found in more profiles under radiata pine than under manuka,  conclusive evidence of an influence of the conifer on halloysite formation  would require the study of more profiles than investigated in this study.    236    ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS    I would like to thank Mr. C.

AbstractWeathering products of Vitrandept profiles on the Kaingaroa plateau, central North Island, New Zealand, were investigated by analysis of oxalate extracts and by chemical and mineralogical analysis of clays of selected soil horizons. Comparisons were made between profiles under a Pinus radiata (D. Don) stand and profiles under an adjacent area of manuka native scrub, Leptospermum scoparium (Myrtaceae).Clay fractions (&lt; 2 Î¼m) of A11 horizon under pine had significantly higher SiO2/Al2O3 mole-ratios (mean SiO2/Al2O3 = 12.2) than A11 horizon under manuka (mean SiO2/Al2O3 = 7.1). No effect of vegetation on clay fractions of B horizon was evident, these clays having much lower SiO2/Al2O3 mole-ratio (1.5). Oxalate-extractable Al, Fe and Si values of &lt; 8-mm fractions of A, B and C horizons showed no differences attributable to present vegetative cover.SiO2/Al2O3 mole-ratios of oxalate extracts increased with increasing depth, and paleosols at &gt; 2 m depth under pine had significantly higher SiO2/Al2O3 mole-ratios in oxalate extracts (mean SiO2/Al2O3 = 2.0) than paleosols under manuka (mean SiO2/Al2O3 = 1.6). That soil horizons at &gt; 2 m depth are in the zone of resilication is indicated by: (1) the greater SiO2/Al2O3 mole-ratios of oxalate extracts of paleosols than surface horizons; (2) lysimeter leachate composition; and (3) the presence of authigenic halloysite at &gt; 2 m depth in soil profiles.
