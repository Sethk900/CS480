Attachment of radiotransmitters to one-day-old sage grouse chicksOur understanding of cause- and age-specific mortality in sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) chicks is limited due to their cryptic and secretive nature. Recent improvements in radiotransmitters have enhanced our ability to monitor sage grouse chicks as young as one day old. We describe a suturing method to attach radiotransmitters to one-day-old sage grouse chicks. During springs of 1999 and 2000, we attached radiotransmitters to 75 chicks from 28 broods and monitored them daily. Radiotransmitter retention rates were high, and there was no sign of infection on recaptured chicks. Using suturing to attach radiotransmitters is an effective means to collect ecological data on sage grouse chicks.
