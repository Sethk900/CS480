Spatial and seasonal variations in soil respiration in a temperate deciduous forest with fluctuating water tableOur objectives were to determine both spatial and temporal variations in soil respiration of a mixed deciduous forest, with soils exhibiting contrasting levels of hydromorphy. Soil respiration (R-S) showed a clear seasonal trend that reflected those of soil temperature (T-S) and soil water content (W-S), especially during summer drought. Using a bivariate model (RMSE = 1.03), both optimal soil water content for soil respiration (W-SO) and soil respiration at both 10 degrees C and optimal soil water content (R-S10) varied among plots, ranging, respectively, from 0.25 to 0.40 and from 2.30 to 3.60 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Spatial variation in W-SO was related to bulk density and to topsoil N content, while spatial variation in R-S10 was related to basal area and the difference in pH measured in water or KCl suspensions. These results offer promising perspectives for spatializing ecosystem carbon budget at the regional scale. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
