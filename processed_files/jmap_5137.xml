Redescription and three-dimensional reconstruction of the limnic acochlidian gastropod Strubellia paradoxa (Strubell, 1892) (Gastropoda: Euthyneura) from Ambon, IndonesiaThis study is the first to examine the entire microanatomy of a representative of the limnic family Acochlidiidae s.l., belonging to the otherwise marine mesopsammic Acochlidia. A paratype of Strubellia paradoxa (Strubell, 1892) was reconstructed three-dimensionally from serial semi-thin sections using the software Amira; additional material recently collected close to the type locality on Ambon Island, Indonesia was examined by scanning electron microscopy. Results are critically compared with the original description by KÃ¼the of 1935. The genital system of S.Â paradoxa is monaulic, with two allosperm receptacles in the male phase, suggesting that the species is a sequential, protandric hermaphrodite rather than gonochoric; an open seminal groove connects to a complex cephalic copulatory apparatus. The two-chambered heart with conspicuous epicardium, the elongated kidney and the looped nephroduct are interpreted as possible adaptations to the freshwater habitat. Differences from S.Â â€œparadoxaâ€ sensu Wawra 1974 and 1988 from the Solomon Islands are discussed.
