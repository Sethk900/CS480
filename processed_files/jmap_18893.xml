Respiratory carbon loss of calcareous grasslands in winter shows no effects of 4 years' CO2 enrichment1. CO2 exchange measurements in long-term CO2-enrichment experiments suggest large net carbon gains by ecosystems during the growing season that are not accounted for by above-ground plant biomass. Considerable amounts of C might therefore be allocated below ground. 2. Winter ecosystem respiration from temperate grasslands under elevated CO2 may account for the loss of a significant part of the extra C gained during the growing season. To test this hypothesis. dark respiration was assessed throughout the winter of the fourth year of CO2 enrichment in a calcareous grassland. 3. Using these data, a model was parameterized to estimate whole-winter respiratory CO2 losses. From November to February, 154 +/- 9 g C m(-2) were respired under elevated CO2 and 144 +/- 5 g C m(-2) under ambient [CO2], with no significant difference between the CO2 treatments. 4. We conclude that (i) wintertime respiration does not constitute a larger C loss from the ecosystem at elevated CO2 and (ii) the absence of respiratory responses implies no extra growing-season C inputs with month-to-year turnover times at elevated CO2.
