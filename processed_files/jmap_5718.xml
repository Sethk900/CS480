Phylogenetic relationships within Amphiglena Clapar√®de, 1864 (Polychaeta: Sabellidae), description of five new species from Australia, a new species from Japan, and comments on previously described speciesIn reviewing material in Australian museum collections from the Australian and Japanese coasts it became clear that many specimens of Amphiglena did not match the diagnosis of any current species. To allow for variability observed among the specimens, and hence within nominal species, three specimens from each locality were included in a cladistic analysis, along with all currently accepted Amphiglena species, new characters, and a variety of apomorphic sabellins. This allowed a reassessment of the monophyly of Amphiglena, its sister group, and relationships with close taxa. Phylogenetic relationships among the species of Amphiglena are presented and six new species are described.
