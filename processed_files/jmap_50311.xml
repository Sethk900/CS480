Karyotype analyses of ten sections of Trigonella (Fabaceae)Abstract Karyotypes of ten sections of genus Trigonella Linnaeus, 1753 (Fabaceae) from Turkey were investigated. Somatic chromosome numbers of examined species were determined as 2n=14 and 16. The karyotype analyses of the species were carried out and somatic chromosome numbers of Trigonella plicata Boiss., 1872, Trigonella brachycarpa (Fisch.) Moris, 1833, Trigonella rostrata Boiss., 1872, Trigonella lunata Boiss., 1843, Trigonella isthmocarpa Boiss. et Balansa 1856, Trigonella rhytidocarpa Boiss. et Balansa, 1859, Trigonella spicata Sibth. et Sm., 1813, Trigonella cephalotes Boiss. et Balansa 1856, Trigonella capitata Boiss., 1843 and Trigonella gladiata Steven, 1808 were reported for the first time. Two pairs of satellite metaphase chromosomes were observed in Trigonella cariensis Boiss., 1843 and one pair in Trigonella lunata.Moreover, 2 B-chromosomes were found only in Trigonella procumbens Rchb., 1830 among all studied species. The aims of this study are to provide karyological data for a significant pool of the taxa, to show differences among them in the number, size and morphology of somatic chromosomes, to verify previous reports or represent numbers which are different from those cited previously.
