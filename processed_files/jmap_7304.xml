Taxonomic notes on Neotropical species in the genus synemosyna (Araneae: Salticidae)Two new species, Synemosyna edwardsi and 5. maddisoni, and the previously undescribed male of 5. decipens (O. P.â€Cambridge) are described. The modified white setae (scales) in this genus are illustrated. S. americana (Peckham and Peckham) from Costa Rica, Mexico, and Panama; and 5. lauretta Peckham and Peckham, and S. lucasi (Taczanowski) from Peru are recorded. A review of the proposed ant models for the genus is discussed, and the formicid genus Crematogaster is suggested as a model for Synemosyna species with swollen opisthosomae.
