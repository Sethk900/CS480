A new species of Gudeodiscus Páll-Gergely, 2013 from China, with extraordinary conchological and anatomical features (Gastropoda, Pulmonata, Plectopylidae)A new species of the Plectopylidae, Gudeodiscus longiplica is described from northern Guangxi Province, southern China. The shell, anatomical and radular characters are figured and described. This new species is characterized by long plicae on its parietal shell wall, which have not been observed in any other Gudeodiscus species. In contrast, the long parietal plicae are characteristic for the genera Plectopylis and Chersaecia, which mainly inhabit Thailand and Myanmar. These two genera are, however, only distantly related to the new species, as other characters (anatomy, protoconch sculpture, parietal plicae) suggest. The male portion of the genital structure of the new species is characterized by two separate penial caeca with different lengths, but similar in outer and inner structure. The relevance of this anatomical character is discussed. Gudeodiscus longiplica sp. n. occurs sympatrically with Gudeodiscus soosi Páll-Gergely, 2013. The anatomy and radula characters of the latter species are also described and figured.
