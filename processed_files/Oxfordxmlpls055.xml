We discuss its important and interesting attributes at the biological, horticultural and medicinal levels. These include an intriguing self-incompatibility system, a sophisticated mechanism for flower bud opening and programmed floral death, and a long history of use by man as a vegetable, ornamental and medicinal plant. We examine the potential for modern technical developments to transform <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> into a valuable model plant.Genetic model organisms have revolutionized science, and today, with the rapid advances in technology, there is significant potential to launch many more plant species towards model status. However, these new model organisms will have to be carefully selected. Here, we argue that <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> (daylily) satisfies multiple criteria for selection and deserves serious consideration as a subject of intensive biological investigation. Several attributes of the genus are of great biological interest. These include the strict control of flower opening and, within a short period, the precisely regulated floral death by a programmed cell death system. The self-incompatibility system in <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> is also noteworthy and deserves more attention. Importantly, the genus is widely cultivated for food, medicinal value and ornamental interest. <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> has considerable potential as a â€˜nutraceuticalâ€™ food plant and the source of new compounds with biomedical activity. The genus has also been embraced by ornamental plant breeders and the extraordinary morphological diversity of hybrid cultivars, produced within a relatively short time by amateur enthusiasts, is an exceptional resource for botanical and genetic studies. We explore these points in detail, explaining the reasons why this genus has considerable valueâ€”both academic and socio-economicâ€”and deserves new resources devoted to its exploration as a model. Its impact as a future model will be enhanced by its amenability to cultivation in laboratory and field conditions. In addition, established methods for various tissue and cell culture systems as well as transformation will permit maximum exploitation of this genus by science.Studies of model organisms have revolutionized biological and medical sciences. Plant biology has made profound progress since the primary dicotyledonous plant genetic modelâ€”thale cress, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>â€”was adopted as a convenient laboratory study organism. This species exemplifies the merits of the primary model organism approach. The comparative speed and simplicity of its life cycle and development, as well as its compact size and relative ease of handling in experimental work, made it the preferred choice as a study organism in hundreds of plant sciences laboratories. As a self-fertilizing, in-breeding species with a relatively small genome, its genetics were approachable and consequently it was the first plant genome to be sequenced. Although not economically important in itself, this species was morphologically and physiologically representative of many other dicots, especially numerous important crop plants in the Brassicaceae. These attributes have allowed <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> to generate, with astonishing rapidity, exceptional new data for plant scientists that is broadly applicable to many other species.Owing to their exceptional economic benefits, other plants with much larger genomes, such as maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) and rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>), have been extensively studied in a similar way, as techniques that permit their investigation at the molecular level have improved. Today, such technical advances are generating exciting potential to adopt many other species as new â€˜modelâ€™ plants. The most significant advance has been the development of high-throughput sequencing of genomic DNA and RNA populations, such as Illumina sequencing methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C18">Deschamps and Campbell 2010</xref>). Other improvements to sequencing methodology, such as direct sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C18">Deschamps and Campbell 2010</xref>), are likely to further change plant biology. The improvements in computational methods that permit assembly of the short sequences into an entire genome sequence have also been dramatic. Together, these advances have allowed the huge genome sequence of allohexaploid bread wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) to be published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C10">Brenchley <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). Other technical advances such as improved methods for genetic transformation, and many new transformation-dependent reverse genetics techniquesâ€”such as efficient, specific gene silencing via artificial microRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C49">Ossowski <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>) and the use of zinc-finger nucleases to engineer specific nucleotide changes in plant DNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C74">Weinthal <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>)â€”are opening up new frontiers in the rapid analysis of gene functions.Nevertheless, the choices for â€˜new model organismsâ€™ in this new â€˜post-<italic>Arabidopsis</italic>â€™ genomic era have to be refined and well informed, to ensure that finite resources are allocated appropriately. Ideally, several different criteria need to be satisfied if a plant taxon is to be selected for such intensive studies. Firstly, the proposed model taxon would have a set of characteristics or attributes that when studied would answer or illuminate important biological questions. In this respect, a balance is required between the model organism exemplifying its phylogenetic group and having unusual or even unique phenotypic traits of exceptional biological interest. Secondly, the relevance of the proposed taxon to contemporary agricultural, horticultural and medicinal usageâ€”and hence an economic justification for its selectionâ€”must be taken into account. Finally, for practical purposes, the ideal study species would be a taxon that is easily cultured and manipulated under laboratory conditions, for example amenable to tissue culture and transformation procedures. When all of these are considered, it should become a great deal easier to select appropriate new model organisms for plant science.In this point of view article, we discuss why one monocotyledonous taxon, <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> (daylily) of the Asparagales, satisfies all of these criteria admirably and in our opinion deserves to be seriously considered as a model organism of the future.<bold>Phylogeny of monocots following APG III classification, showing a zoom on the order Asparagales to the level of family and a zoom on the Xanthorrhoeaceae (<italic>sensu lato</italic>) to the generic level.</bold> The phylogeny was created using the Phylocom program based on published phylogenies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C71">Webb <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). See the text for a further discussion of the <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> classification.<bold>Wild populations of <italic>H. citrina</italic> growing on cliff faces of Mount Tai, Shandong Province, China</bold>.<bold>Basic floral anatomy of <italic>Hemerocallis</italic></bold>. The uppermost part of a flower scape with mature, open flower and developing buds is illustrated on the left. On the right, the diagram shows a longitudinal cross-section through an open flower. The locations of the different components of the SI system are shown: (1) the uppermost region of the stigma, at the entrance to the stylar canal; (2) the junction between the ovary and style; (3) within the ovary, post-fertilization. See the text for a further discussion of the SI systems in <italic>Hemerocallis</italic>.There are two significant and special features of <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> that particularly recommend this genus should deserve serious consideration as a future model organism. Both are reproductive features of the genus that have already received the attention of scientific researchers.The first is the strict developmental control of flower opening and flower senescence in <italic>Hemerocallis.</italic> All known species in the genus share the characteristic of rapid opening of the mature flower bud which occurs over a period of a few hours. This is followedâ€”within 24 h of openingâ€”by highly regulated, programmed death of key floral tissues (the sepals, petals and anther filaments). Indeed, both the common name and the generic name (literally translated as â€˜day beautyâ€™) come from this regular and predictable behaviour of floral death. Although not unique among flowering plants, the genus has an excellent track record in studies of the mechanisms that control opening and subsequently death of the floral tissues. The primary mechanism for opening of a mature flower bud would appear to be a hydraulic mechanism based on the action of hydrolytic enzymes on stored carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C8">Bieleski and Reid 1992</xref>). As might be expected, late bud development is accompanied by linear accumulation of dry weight but this is not matched by wet (fresh) weight, which increases disproportionately just prior to flower opening. At this time, the trisaccharide fructan that has accumulated would appear to be rapidly hydrolysed to fructose and glucose, driving water uptake and petal expansion. This physiological mechanism, dependent on fructan synthesis and then its hydrolysis, must be developmentally regulated by systems tightly linked to circadian rhythm regulation. Indeed, the timing of flower opening varies between species. This has been studied in natural hybrids between the nocturnally opening, moth-pollinated <italic>H. citrina</italic> and the diurnally opening, butterfly-pollinated <italic>H. fulva</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C47">Nitta <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). The timing of floral opening was determined to be a trait that was predominantly under the control of a single major locus, although other loci were likely to make quantitative contributions to this trait. However, the exact molecular nature of the regulation of the timing of bud opening remains mysterious. Nitta <italic>et al.</italic> hypothesize that the locus in the nocturnal <italic>H. citrina</italic> has a promoter to which an evening-phase oscillator (similar to TOC1) binds, while in morning-opening <italic>H. fulva</italic> the promoter has a morning-phase oscillator-binding motif. This study also provided clear evidence that another major locus controlled the timing of flower closing. Hence, just two loci may regulate the strict temporal behaviour of floral biology of <italic>Hemerocallis</italic>.<bold>Schematic diagram showing the approximate timing of key physiological and biochemical events that regulate the opening of a mature bud to senescence of the flower, taking place over c. 60 h</bold>.Detailed knowledge of the PCD systems in plants remains biologically important. For example, PCD systems activated in tissue and organ development have significant effects on their eventual outcome, such as in anther development where tapetal cells surrounding developing pollen must undergo PCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C53">Parish and Li 2010</xref>). Furthermore, PCD is an essential â€˜damage limitationâ€™ and defence response in plants to invasion by pathogens and parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C27">Greenberg 1997</xref>). It is interesting to note that the floral PCD mechanism in <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> cannot be easily broken; despite extensive horticultural breeding, there would appear to be no example to date of variants that have lost this mechanism. This unexpected strength of the PCD system in <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> has led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C47">Nitta <italic>et al.</italic> (2010</xref>) to propose that the major locus regulating floral closing and PCD at some fundamental level(s) must be necessary for plant viability, and it is likely to encode a multifunctional transcription factor.This highly regulated system of flower opening and closing now deserves the full treatment of modern systems biology, to build a comprehensive picture of how this process occurs, integrating transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic data. Although the final result is a rapid destruction of an organ, the process is also co-ordinated with the rest of the plant as significant retrieval of resources takes place via phloem export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C7">Bieleski 1995</xref>). How the signalling systems operate <italic>in planta</italic> to control these fluxes in flower opening and closing over just a short period of time itself deserves to be studied.The other reproductive feature of <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> that has received far less attention, yet nevertheless remains another fascinating area for exploration, is the self-incompatibility (SI) system. Early work on the breeding systems revealed that a number of the species have a level of SI ranging from strong to weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C63">Stout and Chandler 1933</xref>). This early work is difficult to interpret but its strongest message is that SI in this genus involves complex, multi-level systems to prevent self-fertilization. There is evidence for an early system of SI where incompatible pollen tubes grow slowly and do not advance into the stylar canal. Intriguingly, and rather exceptionally, the main element of the SI system in <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> acts very late. This mechanism permits the germination and growth of incompatible pollen tubes through the style, until around the junction between style and ovary. Remarkably, the typically fast-growing pollen tubes of both compatible and incompatible genotypes are then held in near-stasis for a period of hours at this position, with only the compatible pollen tubes growing into the ovary to complete fertilization of the ovules. Unfortunately, anything other than basic histological details of this mechanism remain mysterious. For example, it is not known whetherâ€”in common with the gametophytic SI systems of <italic>Papaver</italic> and <italic>Nicotiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C24">Franklin-Tong and Franklin 2003</xref>)â€”the incompatible pollen tube is rendered inviable. If the incompatible pollen tubes are not incapacitated in this way by the SI system, it is possible that they are unable to respond to specific physical and/or chemical cues produced by the female tissues at this stage. What is so unusual is that both compatible and incompatible pollen tubes are, it would appear, often delayed in their progress towards the target ovules. In many other flowering plant species, pollen tube growth is relatively continuous and there is no lengthy â€˜pit-stopâ€™ prior to fertilization. Indeed, the great selective power of the competitive â€˜raceâ€™ between an excess of pollen tubes to reach a limited number of ovules through the stigmatic tissues is a central tenet of the â€˜progamic theoryâ€™ to explain the evolution of the flowering plants themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C46">Mulcahy 1979</xref>). It may be that, post-pollination, changes in cell wall-modifying enzymes in the gynoecium may be responsible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C36">Konar and Stanley 1969</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C63">Stout and Chandler (1933)</xref> did record cases where pollen tubes grew without delay to the ovary and ovules, and yet another level of SI (perhaps preventing fertilization or involving post-zygotic abortion) prevented offspring from being formed by self-pollination. The locations of SI phenomena are shown in Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS055F3">3</xref>.The largely forgotten research on this particularly complex SI system deserves to be given further experimental attention today using the full raft of modern techniques. What signal(s) force the compatible pollen tube to cease elongation and how the growing tip of the tube is maintained in a plastic state that can be activated into further extension growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C64">Taylor and Hepler 1997</xref>) remain interesting questions. Furthermore, whether there is any connection between the floral PCD system and the operation of the SI system in the gynoecium would be interesting to determine. It is intriguing to note that most horticultural hybrid daylilies have retained a strong SI system that would appear to reject self-pollen effectively (R. T. Grant-Downton, pers. obs.). Perhaps this retention is due to the complexity of SI within the genus, with different stages at which SI phenomena can manifest.<bold>Cultivated <italic>H. fulva</italic> growing in the gardens of West Lake, Hangzhou, China</bold>.The genus has been considered to have exceptional medicinal value in its natural range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C45">MlÄek and Rop 2011</xref>). Traditionally, <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> has been used to treat sleep disorders and to alter mood; in Japan and China it is known as â€˜forget one's sorrow plantâ€™. These purported qualities have been scientifically tested and there is positive evidence for crude plant extracts to alter sleeping patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C67">Uezu 1998</xref>) and alleviate depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C29">Gu <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C79">Yi <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>) in animal models. The leaves have also been used to treat jaundice and inflammation, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C80">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> (2004</xref>) have shown that the leaves contain several compounds, such as roseoside, which strongly inhibit lipid peroxidation. The traditional use of <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> against schistosome infection has been supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C14">Cichewicz <italic>et al.</italic> (2002)</xref>, where several compounds from roots, including novel kwanzoquinones, were found to be active against <italic>Schistosoma</italic> parasites. Anti-proliferative effects and cytotoxicity to cancer cells were also reported for several known and novel anthraquinones isolated from roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C15">Cichewicz <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>).Nevertheless, connecting specific compounds in <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> to therapeutic effects in humans largely remains to be achieved. Adopting <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> as a model organism would greatly assist the studies of biomedically active compounds. By generating more detailed molecular datasets for <italic>Hemerocallis</italic>, in tandem with biomedical studies of greater resolution to identify the active compounds responsible for therapeutic effects, <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> could be transformed into a substantial resource for the discovery of novel pharmaceuticals. Intensive studies would be economically and socially beneficial if obtaining new useful drugs is the goal.While there is already an overwhelming argument for adopting <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> as a model plant, the horticultural heritage of just over a century of intense interest by Western gardeners adds further credence. At the most simplistic level, the popularity of <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> in gardens and its consequent economic value in the horticultural trade make its selection as a future model more appropriate. Additional to this economic justification, new and interesting possibilities for biological investigations were opened up by the activities of gardeners in hybridizing and selecting <italic>Hemerocallis.</italic>Outside of the Far East, <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> is primarily cultivated as a garden ornamental, with currently very little interest in culinary and medicinal usage. This is despite horticultural materialâ€”including presumed Far East cultigens, the virtually sterile triploid forms of <italic>H. fulva</italic>â€”having been cultivated for centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C68">Valder 1999</xref>). Although one of the earliest plants of the Far East to reach the gardens of Western Europe, serious horticultural attention only began after George Yeld made the first artificial interspecific hybrid, which precipitated a new era of deliberate breeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C62">Stout 1934</xref>). Subsequently, selection of the fertile hybrid breeding lines resulting from interspecific crosses, and the discovery and introduction of new species and variants to add to the gene pool, generated a complex hybrid gene pool. Stout of New York Botanic Garden was not only responsible for describing new species and maintaining them in cultivation, but also for a large amount of experimental hybridization work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C63">Stout and Chandler 1933</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C62">Stout 1934</xref>). By repeating artificial crosses many hundreds of times, Stout was able to incorporate the genetics of almost sterile triploid clones of <italic>H. fulva</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C11">Chandler 1940</xref>) into hybrid lines. The origin of these old triploid clones is fascinating and mysterious in itself. No tetraploid individuals have ever been found in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C76">Xiaobai 1996</xref>) and anyway there are significant barriers to interploidy crosses in <italic>Hemerocallis</italic>, with triploids only reliably produced from diploidâ€“tetraploid combinations via <italic>in vitro</italic> embryo rescue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C5">Arisumi 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C42">Li <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Presumably, they were formed by extremely rare events involving unreduced gametes; based on cytology, one investigator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C76">Xiaobai 1996</xref>) has suggested that one double-flowered <italic>H. fulva</italic> triploid clone is an allotriploid hybrid and not an autotriploid.<bold>A modern <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> cultivar, â€˜Aldersgateâ€™, of the â€˜spiderâ€™ form showing the very long, slender tepals typical of these types</bold>.<bold>A modern <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> cultivar, â€˜Laura Nyroâ€™, showing the effect of selection for shallow, open flowers with more rounded, blunter tepals</bold>.<bold>A modern <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> cultivar, â€˜This Side of Paradiseâ€™, showing the effect of selection for outgrowths of tissue at the edges of the tepals</bold>.<bold>A modern <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> cultivar, â€˜Song of The Empireâ€™, showing the effect of selection for â€˜carvingâ€™ by alterations to petal tissue growth</bold>.<bold>A modern <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> cultivar, â€˜Lacy All Overâ€™, showing the effect of selection for ornate, â€˜ruffledâ€™ petal edges</bold>.<bold>A modern <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> hybrid (unnamed) showing the effect of selection for changes to the structure of the tepals to give the â€˜sculpturalâ€™ effect of â€˜pleatingâ€™</bold>.A modern <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> hybrid (unnamed) showing a region within the petal tissue where there is a marked â€˜metallicâ€™ or â€˜reflectiveâ€™ effect indicative of the development of structural colour.The great expansion of horticultural interest in this genus has left a valuable foundation legacy upon which its development as a â€˜modelâ€™ organism could be initiated. <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> is easily cultivated and readily grown in the field and, more importantly, in controlled conditions in glasshouses and growth rooms. Plant breeders have selected particularly small-growing varieties such as â€˜Stella D'Oroâ€™ that would be ideal for use in scientific glasshouses and growth rooms where space is limited. Our own personal observations, from testing just a limited number of named cultivars, indicate that it is easy to identify genotypes (in our trial, the cultivars â€˜Lavender Curlsâ€™ and â€˜Teenie Girlâ€™) that are able to grow uninterrupted and produce inflorescences throughout the year under the constant, controlled greenhouse conditions used for <italic>A. thaliana</italic> production<italic>.</italic> It is clear that even in a small sample of genotypes there is significant heterogeneity in response to cultivation under such conditions, and it would appear that seasonal changes to temperature (such as chilling and diurnal temperature fluctuations) and the intensity or duration of light may be important triggers for inflorescence initiation in certain genotypes. In itself, this area is worthy of further experimental work.The horticultural interest in the genus has generated much valuable information on the practical aspects of cultivation, from sexual reproduction to clonal propagation. For instance, the mechanism of seed dormancy has been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C28">Griesbach and Voth 1957</xref>), and under controlled conditions any dormancy is easily and consistently broken by moist stratification in cold conditions (c. 5 Â°C) for 3â€“4 weeks followed by elevation to a higher temperature (c. 15â€“25 Â°C). Although seed viability is not retained for much longer than 12 months under conventional storage conditions (R. T. Grant-Downton, pers. obs.), long-term cryopreservation to maintain viability appears possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C35">Kholina and Voronkova 2008</xref>).The desire for multiplication of selected cultivars of horticultural value has elicited the development of systems for clonal propagation by tissue culture. A significant load of endophytic microorganisms in <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C38">Leifert and Cassells 2001</xref>) has, to date, effectively restricted this to callus-based systems. However, the genus can be susceptible to somaclonal variation by this method of propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C19">Dunwell 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C56">PodwyszyÅ„ska <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). Recent developments permit efficient callus initiation from small young leaf segments and subsequent shoot regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C41">Li, Z. <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). It has even been possible to make liquid suspension cultures of undifferentiated <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> cells and subsequently regenerate new plants from such material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C37">Krikorian and Kann 1981</xref>), with the formation of embryogenic callus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C60">Smith and Krikorian 1991</xref>). As might be expected, the amenability to tissue culture has assisted the development of systems for generating protoplasts and subsequent plant regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C22">Fitter and Krikorian 1981</xref>) and, most critically, transformation by particle bombardment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C6">Aziz <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>). Transformation is exceptionally important as it permits reverse genetics, for example using specific gene silencing â€˜knockdownâ€™ technology such as hairpin RNAi and artificial microRNA. It also permits other useful developments such as the identification of cell- and tissue-specific promoters by promoter traps, insertional mutagenesis using T-DNA and expression of fluorescent molecules such as green fluorescent protein.One major barrier to adopting <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> as a model organism has been its significant genome size. The diploid hybrids have a genome size of 4522 Mbp/1Câ€”comparable with barley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C65">Tomkins <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). Today, the astonishing advances in high-throughput sequencing technology promise to overcome this inconvenience and propel studies of the genus into a new era where experimental investigations can be much better informed by and supported by genome sequence and gene expression data. Even basic genetics of the genus has recently moved forward with a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS055C23">FogaÃ§a <italic>et al.</italic> (2012)</xref>, where heritability of plant traits such as plant height and the number of floral buds per plant was assessed in modern hybrids. Adopting this kind of approach to studying other characteristics in hybrids would be most illuminating. However, the temporal limitations of using <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> in genetics studies remain dauntingâ€”each generation taking many months from seed formation through to flowering.At many different levels in plant science research, <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> offers superb potential as a model plant of the future. Whilst expensive, fundamental studies that rely on â€˜omicsâ€™ approaches are likely to be able to explore only one or two different members of the genus, other approaches using more traditional molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry and microscopy techniques will not be subject to such restrictions and can sample the full spectrum of diversity, from diploid species to the most intensely selected man-made hybrid tetraploids. New insights into fascinating subjects such as PCD, SI systems and the cellular, molecular and genetic basis of morphological innovations could be generated by exploration in this genus. Equally, more applied studies, such as identifying and studying molecules of potential biomedical importance, would be assisted by embracing <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> as a model organism. We look forward to a future where many more plant biologists are not only aware of, but also actively utilizing, <italic>Hemerocallis</italic> in research.M.J.R.-E. has been financially supported by the â€˜<grant-sponsor xlink:type="simple">Movilidad del Profesorado</grant-sponsor>â€™ (<grant-num xlink:type="simple">PR2007-0487</grant-num>) Initiative, MEC, Spain and â€˜Beca de Movilidad del Gobierno de Canariasâ€™.
