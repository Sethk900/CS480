Variability among barley landraces in response to waterlogging stress in the greenhouseBarley production, in some parts of the Ethiopian central highlands, is constrained by seasonal waterlogging. The aim of this study was to investigate differences in growth, nutrient uptake and concentration under waterlogging stress between landraces varying in tolerance. A three week waterlogging treatment was done in the greenhouse and was compared with a free drainage treatment. Waterlogging reduced the total number of tillers per pot of the tolerant landraces Mage and Feleme by 43% and 48%, respectively compared to the control plants while a 23% reduction was seen for the susceptible landrace Feres Gama. Total shoot dry matter accumulation under waterlogged conditions was comparable for all three landraces. Tillers produced by Feres Gama had significantly less dry matter than Mage and Feleme, however. Differences between the susceptible and tolerant landraces in response to waterlogging were largely due to less dry matter accumulation of the tillers and slower growth in the susceptible landrace. Moreover, apparent differences were noticed in N concentration and uptake between the tolerant and susceptible landraces, the effect being less for the tolerant than the susceptible landraces. Difference in N concentration of shoots between the tolerant and susceptible landraces was also observed, though not comparable to that observed in P.
