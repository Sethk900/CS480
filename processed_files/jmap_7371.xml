A new trachelodesmine genus and species from the Amazon region of Colombia and Ecuador (Diplopoda: Polydesmida: Chelodesmidae)Abstract Tuberodesmus quadricannatus, a new chelodesmid milliped genus and species, is described from the lowland Amazon region of Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the tribe Trachelodesmini but is distinguished by the absence of sphaerogranulae from the legs and antennae, arrangement of dorsal tubercles into four longitudinal carinae, and location of the microsensilla on the fifth rather than the sixth antennomere. The species is the first trachelodesmine known outside the northern Andes of Colombia and Venezuela and represents a considerable range extension for the tribe.
