Restoration of an Ecosystem Function to Revegetation Communities: The Role of Invertebrate Macropores in Enhancing Soil Water InfiltrationGuidelines for revegetation in agricultural landscapes may not address restoration of ecosystem functions because management is focused on the replanting stage, although certain functions are delivered by organisms that colonize revegetation months or years later. We investigated the ecosystem function of water infiltration to tree root zones and channels, delivered by invertebrates that form soil macropores. We measured macropore density and infiltration rates at revegetation sites established on retired grazing land, in relation to site age, tree species composition, and geographical location, compared with adjacent matched pastures. Revegetated sites had significantly more macropores than pastures, and revegetation sites aged 11–20 years had more macropores than sites aged 3–5 and 6–10 years. Tree species had a marginal effect, with more macropores in sites with Acacia spp. and Eucalyptus spp. than those with Eucalyptus spp. only. Besides ants, the main groups of soil burrowers were mygalomorph and lycosid spiders and also ground-nesting native bees. Infiltration rates in revegetation sites aged 11–20 years were double those of pastures and of 3–5 and 6–10 year sites. This is the first study to quantify the rate of recovery of an invertebrate-driven soil hydrological ecosystem function following revegetation.
