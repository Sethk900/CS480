Comanagement of clams in Brazil: a framework to advance comparisonIn Brazil, the recognition that fisheries encompass both natural ecosystems and human well-being has increased, but initiatives are focused largely on highly-valued species, ignoring socially relevant resources such as Venus clams (Anomalocardia brasiliana). We investigate two initiatives involving comanagement of Venus clams in the past two decades: the Marine Extractive Reserve "Pirajuba√©" and the "People of the Tides" project. We focus on the nature of the institutional arrangements, the involved groups (fishing communities and government), and the resource, as well as the steps involved in developing the partnerships, identifying which factors favor success in comanagement. Through these projects, fisherwomen got visibility and clam harvesters became the center of institutional developments. However, their rights in management will not become meaningful unless comanagement in protected areas is fully implemented, and government becomes more willing to share power in harvest planning, and to improve health, infrastructure, and the return of value to fisher families. Only then would such cooperation promote sustainability for Venus clams and fisher families.
