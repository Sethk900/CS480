Bromeli√°ceas como espacio vital para larvas de Conocephalidae y Copiphoridae (Insecta, Saltatoria, Ensifera, Tettigonioidea)The inner part of ground growing or epiphytic Bromeliads filled with water can be the habitat of larvae of Conocephalidae and Copiphoridae. These grasshoppers dive into the water when disturbed. This is enabled by the anatomy of the stigmata. From the waiting position half submerged they ambush for prey, organisms which may come from the upper part of the plant.
