Morphological and acoustic characters of CicadatraÂ platyptera Fieber, 1876Abstract Acoustic and morphological characters are very important to distinguish species of Cicadidae. In this study, the morphological and acoustic characters of Cicadatra platyptera Fieber, 1876 (Hemiptera, Cicadidae) collected from Turkey were analysed. The external morphological structures of two species were drawn and photographs of some specimens were taken. We evaluated taxonomically important morphological characters such as body shape, colors, patterns, structure, and genital structure. We evaluated measurements of external morphological structures and acoustics characters of Cicadatra platyptera from Turkey, partly with statistical analyses. Morphological characters were compared and differentiated from the closely related species, Cicadatra atra. The distribution in Turkey including previous records and the material examined were shown on a map, and the distribution in Palearctic Region was given.
