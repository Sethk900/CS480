Reclassification of Bracon mendocinus, a gall‚Äassociated doryctine wasp, and description of a new closely related species of Allorhogas (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)One of the first reported gall‚Äassociated braconids, from 1910, Bracon mendocinus Kieffer and J√∂rgensen, is removed from the subfamily Braconinae and transferred to the doryctine genus Allorhogas, A. mendocinus (Kieffer and J√∂rgensen) comb. nov. A new species morphologically similar to A. mendocinus, A. joergenseni Martinez and Zaldivar‚ÄRiver√≥n sp. nov., is also described. Additionally a neotype is designated for B. mendocinus Kieffer and J√∂rgensen. We base our conclusions on the morphological examination of recently collected specimens from central Argentina associated with galls on Lycium chilense (Solanaceae), as well as on the DNA variation at 28S ribosomal RNA and cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) mitochondrial DNA genes.
