Modern analyses on an historical data set: skull morphology of Italian red squirrel populationsAbstract Recent molecular evidence suggests that Sciurus vulgaris populations from Calabria (southern Italy) are distinct from those occurring in northern and central Italy. Here, we re-analyzed using multivariate and univariate techniques an historical dataset provided by Cavazza (1913), who documented measurements for the now extinct squirrel population from Campania. Both univariate and multivariate analyses confirmed that the sample from Calabria was homogenous and relatively distinct compared to the rest of the squirrel samples.
