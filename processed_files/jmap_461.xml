Effect of temperature and salinity on germination of Salsola vermiculata L. (Chenopodiaceae) from Canary Islands.Salsola vermiculata L. (Chenopodiaceae) is a perennial shrub species widely distributed in arid zones of South Europe, North Africa, Canary Islands and Southwest Asia. Experiments were conducted in the laboratory to determine the effect of temperature and salinity on seed germination. Seeds were germinated at three alternating temperatures (10-20, 15-25 and 20-30 °C), with five NaCl concentrations (0, 200, 400, 600 and 800 mM) and 12 h photoperiod. Germination percentage and germination rate decreased with an increase in temperature and NaCl concentration. The higher percentages were obtained at 10-20 °C in seeds exposed to 0 and 200 mM NaCl. Recovery percentages decreased with the increase of the incubation temperature. S. vermiculata is moderately salt tolerant at germination stage, and tolerance is affected by the interaction of temperature and NaCl concentration.
