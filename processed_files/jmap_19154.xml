Contribution of root respiration to total soil respiration in a Leymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzvel. grassland of northeast ChinaThe loss of carbon through root respiration is an important component of grassland carbon budgets. However, few data are available concerning the contribution of root respiration to total soil respiration in grasslands in China. We investigated seasonal variations of soil respiration rate, root biomass, microbial biomass C and organic C content of the soil in a semi-arid Leymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzvel. grassland of northeast China during the 2002 growing season (from May to September). The linear regression relationship between soil respiration rate and root biomass was used to determine the contribution of root respiration to total soil respiration. Soil respiration rate ranged from 2.5 to 11.9 g C/m(2) per d with the maximum in late June and minimum in September. The microbial biomass C and organic C content of the soil ranged from 0.3 to 1.5 g C/m(2) and from 29 to 34 g C/kg respectively. Root biomass had two peaks, in early June (1.80 kg/m(2)) and mid-August (1.73 kg/m(2)). Root respiration rate peaked in mid-August (6.26 g C/m(2) per d), whereas microbial respiration rate peaked in late June (7.43 g C/m(2) per d). We estimated that the contribution of root respiration to total soil respiration during the growing season ranged from 38% to 76%.
