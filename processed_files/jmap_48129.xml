New species of the cicada genus Semia Matsumura (Hemiptera: Cicadidae) from China and a phylogeny of Semia spp. and their relatives based on molecular dataTwo new cicada species, Semia brevidilata, sp. nov. and Semia tibetensis, sp. nov., are described from China. Semia majuscula, a newly recorded species to China, is re-described, as some new characteristics are recognised which may be useful for further taxonomic and phylogenetic analysis of this genus and its allies. Partial mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences of five Semia species and relatives belonging to the genera Pomponia Stål and Psithyristria Stål are further analysed to confirm the validity of related new species and to provide a useful reference for the identification of Semia. A key to all species of Semia is provided, and the phylogenetic relationships among species of Semia and their relatives are discussed.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:64144283-8CCE-4687-9D07-2033939165E7
