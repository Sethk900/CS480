Satellite retrieved cloud optical thickness sensitive to surface wind speed in the subarctic marine boundary layerThe optical and microphysical properties of low level marine clouds, presented over the Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea, have been investigated for the period 2000–2006. The air masses were transported for more or less seven days over the warmer North Atlantic before they arrived at the area investigated. The main focus in this study is on investigating the relationship between cloud optical thickness (COT) and surface wind speed (U10 m) using satellite retrievals in combination with operational meteorological data. A relatively strong correlation (R2 = 0.97) is obtained for wind speeds up to 12 m s – 1, in air masses that were probably to a major degree influenced by wind shears and to a minor degree by buoyancy. The relationship (U2.5) is also in between those most commonly found in the literature for water vapor ( ∼ U1) and sea salt ( ∼ U3.4). The present results highlight the magnitude of marine sea-spray influence on COT and their global climatic importance.
