Tuco-tucos (Rodentia, Octodontidae) in Southern Brazil: Ctenomys lami spec. nov. Separated from C. minutus Nehring 1887Ctenomys lami, a new species from southern Brazil, is described and compared with a closely related species, C. minutus Nehring 1887. Cytogenetic analysis and morphological characters confirm the new taxon. Evidences suggest that C. minutus is derived from C. lami by a speciation process based on chromosome differences.
