Comparison of soil respiration among three temperate forests in Changbai Mountains, ChinaCO2 efflux from forest soils is an important process in the global carbon cycle; however, effects of stand age and successional status remain uncertain. We compared soil respiration and its relationship to soil carbon content, forest floor mass, root biomass, soil temperature, and soil moisture content among three temperate forest ecosystems in Changbai Mountains, northeastern China, from 2003 to 2005. Forest types included an old-growth, mixed coniferous and broad-leaved primary forest (MN), a middle-aged, broad-leaved secondary forest (BL), and a young coniferous plantation forest (CP). Average annual soil CO2 efflux at BL (1477.9 +/- 61.8 g C.m(-2).year(-1)) was significantly higher than at CP (830.7 +/- 48.7 g C.m(-2).year(-1)) and MN (935.4 +/- 53.3 g C.m(-2).year(-1)). Differences in soil temperature among those sites were not statistically significant but contributed to the differences in annual CO2 efflux. In addition, the temperature response of soil CO2 efflux was higher at MN (Q(10) = 2.78) than that at BL (Q(10) = 2.17) and CP (Q(10) = 2.02). Our results suggest that successional stage affects soil respiration by the differences in substrate quantity and quality, environmental conditions, and root respiration.
