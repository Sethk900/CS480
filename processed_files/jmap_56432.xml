Soil characteristics on varying lithological substrates in the South Shetland Islands, maritime AntarcticaSoils in ice-free areas of Livingston Island have been forming since the last deglaciation in a maritime warmer climate that is more humid than in interior Antarctica. A soil survey was carried out on Byers and Hurd peninsulas to characterize the soils and investigate the processes. Soils were sampled on two different substrates, mudstones and volcanic rocks in Byers Peninsula and greywackes in Hurd Peninsula. Sampling sites were located on raised beaches, platforms, and on volcanic outcrops across an altitudinal range from few m to 150 m a.s.l. The pH, electrical conductivity, carbonates and organic matter showed similar patterns in each geomorphic unit but their values differed between bedrocks. The sand, silt and clay contents differed greatly in the soils on mudstones and volcanic rocks. The elemental composition was closely related to mineralogy of parent materials. Mg, K, Zn, Mn, and Fe were similar in the soils on all bedrocks. The Al content was highest on the volcanic rocks. The largest difference in the Ca content was between the soils on greywackes and mudstones. The Na, Pb, and Ba contents in soils on the mudstones differed greatly from the rest of bedrocks. Geochemical and mineralogical characteristics suggest that the main process involved in soil development was the mechanical disintegration of bedrock although there was also some leaching. Cryogenic processes play a key role in soil development but chemical weathering processes were also involved in soil evolution although limited in extent due to the restriction of water circulation to summer.
