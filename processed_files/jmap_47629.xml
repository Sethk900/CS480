Pristomyrmex tsujii sp. n. and P. mandibularis Mann (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) from FijiAbstract Pristomyrmex tsujii sp. n., an endemic species of the Fiji islands, is described from the worker, ergatoid queen, alate queen and male castes. The alate queen and male castes of Pristomyrmex mandibularis Mann are also described for the first time. The ergatoid queens for both species appear to be morphologically intermediate between the worker and alate queen castes. Pristomyrmex tsujii is readily distinguished from Pristomyrmex mandibularis by the lack of well-developed propodeal spines. Although both species occur across the Fijian archipelago, they are rarely encountered and workers are most often collected from sifted litter. The descriptions are illustrated with specimen photographs, line drawings and a distribution map.
