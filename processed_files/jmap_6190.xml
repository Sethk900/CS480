The combining ability of RTx432 for Sorghum malt quality and stem borer resistanceCombining ability of R-lines with respect to malt quality and stem borer resistance was evaluated in two trials. Crosses between three R-lines and eight R-lines were made for malt quality and three R-lines and seven R-lines for stem borer resistance evaluation. The R-line RTx432 showed superior combining ability for both characteristics, indicating its potential value to the local sorghum industry.
