A revision of the Cautires obsoletus species group from Java (Coleoptera, Lycidae)Abstract The Javanese fauna of the species group Cautires obsoletus is revised. Altogether, eight Javanese species were classified in the group; five of them are proposed to be junior subjective synonyms: Cautires fruhstorferi Dudkova & Bocak, 2010, a replacement name of Bulenides lineatus Pic, 1921, Cautires javanicus Bourgeois, 1883, Cautires inhumeralis (Pic, 1921), Cautires nigromaculatus (Pic, 1925), and Cautires pudicus (Kleine, 1931) (all synonymized to Cautires obsoletus Waterhouse, 1879). Three Javanese species are redescribed: Cautires apicalis (Pic, 1925), Cautires obsoletus (Waterhouse, 1878), and Cautires singularithorax (Pic, 1925). Cautires apicalis (Pic, 1925) is removed from the synonymy of Cautires corporaali (Pic, 1921) and reinstated as a valid name. Three new species are proposed: Cautires walteri sp. n., Cautires taoi sp. n., and Cautires sukosarensis sp. n. All species are keyed and principal diagnostic characters are illustrated. The distribution and relationships to Cautires fauna of other Great Sundas islands are briefly discussed.
