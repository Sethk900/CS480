Taxonomy of the genus Oriverutus Siddiqi, 1971 (Nematoda: Dorylaimida: Nordiidae)After introducing its history, the most relevant morphological features of Oriverutus are explained, illustrated (light and scanning electron microscope pictures) and discussed. The taxonomy of the genus is analysed based on the study of all the nominal species, and an emended diagnosis is provided. Its relationships with the closest genera are discussed, and some reflections are made on its phylogeny. Ecanema and Mammillonema are confirmed as junior synonyms of Oriverutus, Inbionema is regarded as its junior synonym also, whereas Paroriverutus is considered to deserve separate generic status. Consequently, several nomenclatorial changes are derived: Paroriverutus ivorensis is retained under Paroriverutus, Drepanodorylaimus macramphidius and Oriverutus longicaudatus are transferred to Paroriverutus, and Inbionema biforme to Oriverutus. An updated list of Oriverutus species is provided as well as a key to the identification of its didelphic species and a compendium of their morphometrics.
