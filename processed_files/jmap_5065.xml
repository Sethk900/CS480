Introduction, distribution and habitats of the invasive spider Badumna longinqua (L. Koch, 1867) (Araneae: Desidae) in Uruguay, with notes on its world dispersionIn Uruguay, Badumna longinqua is an invasive species arising from Australia. Phoresy by human activities and strong adaptation to synantropic sites have been the main factors that have contributed to the dispersal of this species to other countries. In this study, we analysed the dispersion of B. longinqua in Uruguay using voucher specimens deposited in Uruguayan arachnological collections and new field captures. A logistic regression was performed to evaluate the relationship of this species with the studied habitats. We found individuals of B. longinqua associated with many different synantropic sites, such as the bark of Eucalyptus spp. trees situated in parks, avenues and commercial plantations. As this crop is being extensively planted for the production of bleached hardwood pulp for paper production in Uruguay, Brazil, Argentina and others countries, we postulate the probable expansion of B. longinqua to other parts of South America.
