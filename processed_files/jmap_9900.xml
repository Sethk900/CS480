An Outbreak of Probable Leptospirosis in California Sea Lions along the Oregon Coast during Fall 1984California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) experience periodic outbreaks of the bacterial disease leptospirosis causing death and debilitation. In fall 1984, an outbreak of presumed leptospirosis occurred during the northward migration of male California sea lions. The assumption that Leptospira bacterium was present was strengthened by positive serology and demonstration of organisms using silver staining techniques in the kidneys of three animals from Oregon. Systematic beach surveys and reports of dead and debilitated sea lions on beaches were used to estimate the mortality of Zalophus during their northward migration off Oregon. From August 1984 to February 1985, 252 male Zalophus ranging in age from 2 to 13 years were found dead on the beaches of Oregon. The number of animals found dead represent approximately 15% of the total animals seen on haul-out sites during peak northern migration off Oregon.
