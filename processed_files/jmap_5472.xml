The reproductive ecology of Leptodactylus fuscus (Anura, Leptodactylidae): new data from natural temporary ponds in the Brazilian Cerrado and a review throughout its distributionRecent studies indicate that populations historically called Leptodactylus fuscus (Schneider, 1799) comprise at least three wellâ€differentiated lineages. Herein, we describe the reproductive ecology of a southeastern clade population of L. fuscus, and review the characters of the reproductive ecology for several populations of the northern and southeastern clades. Most reproductive activity occurred in December and January, which coincided with the highest rainfall period. Males had an aggregated spatial distribution in the central area of the ponds. Three courtship interactions were observed. A female was observed closing the entrance to a burrow with moist sand after oviposition. This behaviour is described for the first time in L. fuscus. The review of the reproductive biology of the northern and southeastern clades indicates a relatively high plasticity in L. fuscus. Furthermore, the results corroborate the suggestion, based on molecular data, that the northern and southeastern clades of L. fuscus represent distinct evolutionary units.
