Morphology, niche segregation, and escape tactics in a sand dune lizard community.We examined patterns of co-existence for three species of scincid lizards (Sphenops sepsoides, Scincus scincus, and Chalcides ocellatus) in the simple sand dune habitat of North Sinai, Egypt. We first examined the morphological differences among the three species and compared their niche use and escape tactics in the context of their morphologies. Our results suggests that natural selection has favored two different phenotypes, Scincus scincus's long limbs with toe fringes and Sphenops sepspoides's extremely reduced limbs for sand locomotion. These two sand specialists, Sphenops sepsoides and Scincus scincus, shared microhabitats such as soft substrate and occurred further away from vegetation but showed strong separation in the surface temperatures at which they were active. The generalist species, C. ocellatus which lacked toe fringes and had relatively short limbs that were not reduced enough for fossorial movement, was found closer to vegetation and on harder substrates where such traits may be beneficial. Escape tactics may further strengthen habitat partitioning between desert generalists and sand specialists as C. ocellatus sprint to vegetation to escape predators whereas both sand specialists dive into the sand. Our results suggest that traditional ideas about predation risk may not apply to sand diving lizards as they may be able to venture far from vegetation refuges without increased vulnerability to predation.
