Seasonal variation in soil respiration of a fruit orchardSoil respiration was measured with a new portable soil respiration system type SRS (PP Systems, Hitchin, England) in an established apple orchard on a sandy loam near Bonn in monthly intervals during four years (1994-1997): 1. The equipment proved suitable for the purpose over a wide range of field temperatures. 2. Soil respiration ranged from less than 0.2 g CO2 in winter, 0.3-0.6 g CO2 in spring and autumn to 0.7-1.3 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in summer. 3. This is equivalent to an CO2 efflux from the soil in the tree strip of 8-16 kg CO2 in winter, 24-48 kg CO2 in spring and autumn and 56-104 kg CO2 ha(-1) day(-1) in the summer resulting in a CO2 efflux from such a fruit orchard in the order of 19-25 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1).
