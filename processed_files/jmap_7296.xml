DinÃ¡mica Temporal de PequeÃ±os Peces de Agua libre en la Laguna â€œLa Cuarentenaâ€; (Isla Carabajal, rÃ­o ParanÃ¡ medio)The experimental use of a small trawl, in â€œLa Cuarentenaâ€; lagoon (31Â°42'S, 60Â°37'W), during 1982 allowed to obtain preliminary data on the species rechange and specific diversity variations through the time. A total of 1011 specimens belonging principally to 5 families: Clupeidae, Engraulidae, Characidae, Curimatidae and Auchenipteridae were caught. Changes in the fish community in function of the water level variations, temperature and migration patterns of the involved species are analized.
