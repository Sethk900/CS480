Determination of age and age classes of Akodon olivaceus in Southern ChileAbstract Age and age classes in Akodon olivaceus brachiotis were determined by means of a modification of the method used by Sluiter (1961) to quantify tooth wear. Ten age categories were obtained. From April to July the population was mainly composed of young animals. From November to March the population was heterogeneous due to the coexistence of newâ€born animals and animals born in the previous reproductive season.
