Bare soil and reed canary grass ecosystem respiration in peat extraction sites in Eastern FinlandThis paper reports chamber measurements of ecosystem respiration (ER) from reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) (RCG) cultivation made during 2004 and 2005 and respiration rates from an adjacent, bare peat extraction site. Annually, the RCG site released 1465 g in 2004 and 1968 g CO2 m(-2) in 2005. The peat extraction site, however, emitted 498 g in 2004 and 264 g CO2 m(-2) in 2005. Heterotrophic respiration accounted for about 45% of the RCG ER. Temperature explained 75-88% of the variation in 2005 RCG heterotrophic respiration. Autotrophic respiration was the dominant component of ER and it followed a similar seasonal pattern as the living (green) biomass. RCG heterotrophic respiration was related to soil temperature in interaction with soil volumetric water content and seasonal rainfall distribution. It explained 79 and 47% of the variation in the bare soil respiration from the peat extraction site during 2004 and 2005 snow free periods, respectively. Compared to other ecosystems, emissions from RCG were lower indicating that the RCG is a promising after use option in organic soils.
