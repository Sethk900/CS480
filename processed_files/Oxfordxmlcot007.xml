hormones allow animals to adjust their physiology and behaviour to predictable and unpredictable changes in the environment. We investigated the effects of an increase in stress hormone levels on the breeding effort and the reproductive ouput of chick-rearing male AdÃ©lie penguins.Study of physiological mechanisms can help us to understand how animals respond to changing environmental conditions. In particular, stress hormones (i.e. glucocorticoids, such as corticosterone) are described as mediating resource allocation, allowing animals to adjust their physiology and behaviour to predictable and unpredictable changes in the environment. In this study, we investigated the effects of an experimental increase in baseline corticosterone levels on the breeding effort and the reproductive output of chick-rearing male AdÃ©lie penguins (<italic>Pygoscelis adeliae</italic>). The number of chicks per nest, their body mass, and their size were monitored throughout the study. Direct observations allowed measurement of the time spent foraging at sea and caring for the young on the nest. At the end of the treatment, blood samples were collected for isotope analysis. Although all birds raised at least one chick, reproductive output was decreased by 42% in corticosterone-treated birds compared with control birds. The increase in corticosterone levels during the guard stage did not affect the mass of surviving chicks or the brood mass at fledging. Corticosterone-treated males spent on average 21% more time at the nest than control birds. However, the duration of foraging trips was similar between both groups. In addition, the similarity of isotopic signatures suggests that both groups foraged at similar locations and ingested the same prey species. The detailed on-land behaviour of birds should be examined in further studies to clarify the possible links between corticosterone levels, brooding time, and reproductive output. Understanding the relationships between glucocorticoids, fitness, and ultimately population dynamics is fundamental to enabling conservation physiology as a discipline to be successful in helping to manage species of conservation concern.Organisms live in a changing environment, which they deal with by adjusting their morphology, physiology, and behaviour to face current conditions. Many studies report that increases in environmental variability associated with climate change affect wildlife drastically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C73">Walther <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C68">Stenseth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). For instance, cases of animal population decline in response to such changes are increasingly reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C53">McCarthy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C37">Croxall <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C18">Both <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Animals face trade-offs in terms of how they allocate energy to different biological functions, such as reproduction and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C67">Stearns, 1992</xref>). Although changes in key life-history trade-offs are thought to be at the heart of these population declines (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C81">Woodhams <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C1">Acevedo-Whitehouse and Duffus, 2009</xref>), we still know little about the mechanisms underlying these declines. In order to achieve a better understanding of how organisms respond to changing environmental conditions, physiological mechanisms must be considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C58">PÃ¶rtner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C27">Chown and Gaston, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C59">PÃ¶rtner and Farrell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C28">Chown <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C40">Fuller <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). In particular, stress hormones (i.e. glucocorticoids) are described as mediating resource allocation, allowing animals to adjust their physiology and behaviour to both predictable and unpredictable regimens of environmental variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C44">Jacobs and Wingfield, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C80">Wingfield and Silverin, 2009</xref>).Glucocorticoids are acutely released during life-threatening situations, such as food shortage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C47">Kitaysky <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>), severe weather conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C61">Romero <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), and acute predation risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C29">Cockrem and Silverin, 2002</xref>). The activation of the hypothalamicâ€“pituitaryâ€“adrenal axis and the subsequent release of glucocorticoids trigger the emergency life-history stage, i.e. when an individual aborts the current breeding attempt in order to survive the perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C76">Wingfield <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C77">Wingfield and Kitaysky, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C78">Wingfield, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C51">Landys <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Elevated glucocorticoid levels can affect the physiology and behaviour of animals in a variety of ways. In particular, stress hormones control energy metabolism and fuel utilization and may promote escape behaviour through glucose mobilization and increased locomotor activity, finally leading to a reduction in or abandonment of the reproductive effort (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C51">Landys <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C22">Breuner, 2011</xref> for review). Elevated glucocorticoid levels also enhance activities related to foraging behaviour and food intake.In birds, elevated baseline levels of corticosterone (CORT; the main avian glucocorticoid) generally observed during reproduction might facilitate reproductive effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C62">Romero, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C52">Love <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), especially allowing individuals to supply their offspring through its positive effect on foraging activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C49">Koch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C50">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C6">Angelier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C7">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C54">Miller <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C36">Crossin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).On the contrary, high CORT levels are suspected to disrupt parental behaviour, because they are often associated with abandonment of reproduction in birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C63">Silverin, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C79">Wingfield and Sapolsky, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C41">Groscolas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C64">SpÃ©e <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). These contrasting effects seem to be driven by extrinsic factors; during unfavourable environmental conditions, when organisms cope with high energetic constraints, CORT could redirect energy allocation from the provisioning of chicks to the benefit of self-maintenance (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C76">Wingfield <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Furthermore, it is often assumed, despite little direct evidence, that the acute adrenocortical response to stress favours self-maintenance behaviour at the expense of current reproduction (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C21">Breuner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref> for a detailed review of the relationships between the acute adrenocortical response and fitness). Growing evidence suggests that the modulation of baseline CORT levels participates in the mediation of trade-offs between current reproductive output (parental investment) and self-maintenance through foraging activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C48">Kitaysky <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C51">Landys <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C6">Angelier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C7">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C43">Horton and Holberton, 2009</xref>).Subcutaneous CORT implants that modulate baseline CORT levels may lead to better understanding of the mechanisms that link glucocorticoids and reproductive effort, and hence allow the establishment of conservation measures in species facing changes in their environment.Seabirds respond to food shortages by an increase in the circulating baseline corticosterone levels. For example, a 3-fold increase in stress hormone levels was measured in food-deprived black-legged kittiwake (<italic>Rissa tridactyla</italic>) adults and chicks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C48">Kitaysky <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). An artificial increase in the CORT level could, to some extent, mimic the effect of an environmental stressor. The objectives of this study were, therefore, to examine the consequences of an experimental increase in baseline CORT levels on the parental effort and reproductive output of control and CORT-treated AdÃ©lie penguins (<italic>Pygoscelis adeliae</italic>).Polar ecosystems are relatively pristine environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C11">Bargagli, 2004</xref>). Yet, recent climate change poses a new challenge to the survival of Arctic and Antarctic wildlife. For example, AdÃ©lie penguin populations are increasing in the Ross Sea region and decreasing in the Antarctic Peninsula, with an overall increase of the net global population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C2">Ainley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). However, the species is expected to undergo a 30% population decline over the next three generations due to the effects of projected climate change, in particular in association with a decrease in the concentration of sea ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C2">Ainley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Loss of sea ice can be seen as a major stressor for AdÃ©lie penguins and other top predators. Indeed, sea ice is the preferred habitat of Antarctic krill (<italic>Euphausia superba</italic>), the main food source of penguins, leading to a strong dependence of AdÃ©lie penguins on sea ice (for discussion of AdÃ©lie penguins as a â€˜creature of the pack iceâ€™, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C3">Ainley, 2002</xref>). There can be important interannual variations in environmental conditions in Antarctica, in particular regarding the extent of sea-ice and the timing of its retreat. These changes can have major consequences for the breeding success of AdÃ©lie penguins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C39">Emmerson and Southwell, 2008</xref>), their corticosterone levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C30">Cockrem <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), and the durations of their foraging trips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C14">Beaulieu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). The species has recently been uplisted from Least Concern to Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List for these reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C15">BirdLife International, 2012</xref>). Future climatic changes remain largely uncertain, and further work is required to determine how they will impact penguins. As such, we rapidly need to establish a benchmark for future investigations and to understand the factors that affect the breeding success of AdÃ©lie penguins.Exogenous CORT induced nest abandonment of fasting, incubating male AdÃ©lie penguins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C65">SpÃ©e <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011a</xref>), together with decreased incubation temperatures and a lengthened incubation period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C70">Thierry <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). We would therefore expect CORT treatment to increase the rate of nest desertion of chick-rearing male AdÃ©lie penguins, resulting in decreased reproductive output. In this case, individuals would tend to allocate their energy to self-maintenance at the expense of current reproduction. In contrast, CORT implants in female macaroni penguins (<italic>Eudyptes chrysolophus</italic>) were found to affect foraging behaviour, parental care, and chick growth in a positive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C36">Crossin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Consequently, positive effects of CORT treatment on reproductive effort could also be expected in our study. In order to distinguish between these contrasting predictions, we manipulated the CORT levels and examined the effects of the treatment on the parental effort of chick-rearing AdÃ©lie penguins.The study was carried out at the French research station Dumont d'Urville (66Â°40â€²S, 140Â°01â€²E), East Antarctica, during the 2008â€“2009 austral summer. AdÃ©lie penguins reproduce once a year. Their breeding cycle comprises four distinct stages from mid-October to mid-February: courtship, incubation, guard stage, and crÃ¨che stage. This study focuses on the guard stage, when both parents alternate between foraging at sea and chick attendance at the nest.AdÃ©lie penguins weigh 3.2â€“8â€…kg, depending on the life-history stage. Females usually lay two eggs (mean clutch size, 1.8), and 1.6 chicks per nest hatch. About one chick is fledged per breeding pair, with a mean weight at fledging of âˆ¼3â€…kg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C3">Ainley, 2002</xref>). Although in AdÃ©lie penguins, as in most seabird species, both parents care for their young, previous studies on stress hormones in AdÃ©lie penguins have mostly considered male birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C65">SpÃ©e <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C70">Thierry <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) because males can fast for up to 40â€“50â€…days at the beginning of the breeding season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C72">Vleck and Vleck, 2002</xref>). In order to obtain data comparable with these previous studies and because treating both partners could induce confounding effects or be deleterious for the current reproduction, only male AdÃ©lie penguins were studied here.The protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the French Polar Institute (Institut Paul-Emile Victor; IPEV) and authorized by the French Southern and Antarctic Territories (Terres Australes et Antarctiques FranÃ§aises; TAAF).Thirty randomly selected pairs were captured on their nest at the end of the courtship (mid-November). Each member of the pair was identified with a Nyanzol-D number painted on the chest feathers and stickers inserted between the back feathers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C14">Beaulieu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), allowing easy identification in the colony. Penguins were sexed by a combination of parameters, including cloacal inspection before egg laying and observations of incubation routine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C46">Kerry <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C14">Beaulieu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Visual observations of the 30 nests were made from a distance every 2â€“3â€…h each day during the entire study period, in order to observe laying, hatching, and presence of each partner on the nest, and to measure foraging trip duration.breeding phenology of Ade<sup>'</sup>lie penguins and study protocol during the chick-rearing period (guard stage). The studied male penguins were captured twice and monitored throughout this period.All 14 males were captured at the beginning of the guard stage (28â€…Decemberâ€“2â€…January). Half of them (experimental group) were implanted with a self-degradable CORT-releasing pellet, while the others (control group) underwent the same procedure without implantation of a pellet. For both groups, a small area of skin around the nape of the neck was disinfected with 70% alcohol, an incision âˆ¼1â€…cm long was made, and this incision was finally (after implantation for the experimental group) closed with a sterile stitch and sprayed with Alumisol<sup>Â®</sup> (healing external suspension). Corticosterone pellets (100â€…mg, 21â€…days release; Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL, USA) were implanted subcutaneously in the nape of the neck. Previous studies had shown that these pellets led to a 2- to 4-fold increase of CORT levels in free-living male AdÃ©lie penguins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C65">SpÃ©e <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C70">Thierry <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).At the end of the guard stage/early crÃ¨che stage, 19â€…Â±â€…2â€…days after the first capture (16â€“19â€…January), males returning from a foraging trip were recaptured together with their chicks. A small blood sample (âˆ¼0.3â€…mL) was collected from the alar or tarsal vein and subsequently kept at âˆ’20Â°C until stable isotope analysis. For 4 (3 control group chicks and 1 CORT group chick) of the 18 chicks (12 control group chicks and 6 CORT group chicks), blood sampling was not performed due to severe weather conditions during the sampling period. A control pair placed next to a crÃ¨che had no attributable chick, so that only 13 chicks were included for blood analyses. The mass and flipper length of adult males and chicks were measured using a Pesola spring balance (5â€…kgâ€…Â±â€…0.3% for chicks and 10â€…kgâ€…Â±â€…0.3% for adults) and a ruler (Â±â€…1â€…mm), respectively. In adult penguins, the flipper length has been considered to provide a good indicator of body size, because flippers do not grow after fledging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C55">MÃ­nguez <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). A scaled mass index was calculated as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C57">Peig and Green, 2009</xref>). Chicks were also weighed and measured 39â€“43â€…days after hatching, when their weight is at a maximum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C3">Ainley, 2002</xref>).During the study period, the number of chicks was checked thoroughly (by gently pushing the adult present on the nest when needed) on several occasions: before treatment (27â€…December), at capture devoted to CORT implantation or sham manipulation, during treatment (9â€…January), at the end of the study during recapture, and 39â€“43â€…days after hatching. This was done to assess the reproductive output, defined as the number of chicks per nest, the body weight of the chicks, and the brood mass.In AdÃ©lie Land, penguins are known to feed principally on a mix of krill and fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C74">Wienecke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). The stable isotope signatures have been evaluated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C26">Cherel (2008)</xref> for Antarctic krill (<italic>E.â€…superba</italic>; Î´<sup>13</sup>Câ€…=â€…âˆ’25.4â€…Â±â€…0.6, Î´<sup>15</sup>Nâ€…=â€…5.3â€…Â±â€…0.5; sampled in summer 2002), ice krill (<italic>Euphausia crystallorophias</italic>; Î´<sup>13</sup>Câ€…=â€…âˆ’25.4â€…Â±â€…0.4, Î´<sup>15</sup>Nâ€…=â€…6.8â€…Â±â€…0.7; sampled in summer 2002), and Antarctic silverfish (<italic>Pleuragramma antarcticum</italic>; Î´<sup>13</sup>Câ€…=â€…âˆ’24.7â€…Â±â€…0.4, Î´<sup>15</sup>Nâ€…=â€…10.6â€…Â±â€…0.3, sampled in winter/spring 2002). The stable isotope analysis of the diet of AdÃ©lie penguins is known to be relatively consistent with analyses of prey found in their stomach content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C71">Tierney <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).The tissue isotopic signature mirrors the diet throughout the period of tissue synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C12">Bearhop <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), and according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C25">Cherel &amp; Hobson (2007)</xref>, whole blood has a 1â€…month turnover in large birds. Thus, we assume that our isotopic measure integrates the diet of adult males over the whole treatment period. Given that chicks are unable to feed by themselves, their isotopic signature depends largely on the food brought by their parents. Stable carbon and nitrogen assays were carried out at the Centre de Recherche sur les EcosystÃ¨mes Littoraux AnthropisÃ©s, L'Houmeau, France. Replicate measurements showed coefficients of variation for Î´<sup>13</sup>C and Î´<sup>15</sup>N values of standard acetanilide of 0.34 and 9.61%, respectively. Values are expressed in the usual Î´ notation (â€°) relative to Pee Dee Belemnite (PDB) for Î´<sup>13</sup>C and atmospheric nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) for Î´<sup>15</sup>N.All statistical analyses were performed with Râ€…2.13.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C60">R Development Core Team, 2011</xref>). Results are expressed as meansâ€…Â±â€…SEM. Differences were considered statistically significant when <italic>P</italic>â€…&lt;â€…0.05.Owing to the small sample sizes, Wilcoxon tests were used to compare adult male body mass, scaled mass index, hatching date between groups, initial and final capture dates, and the number of chicks per pair before and at the end of the treatment (control <italic>vs.</italic> CORT).Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to compare time budget (time spent at sea and time spent at the nest), reproductive output (number of chicks per nest), and chick mass between control birds and CORT-treated birds. Generalized estimating equations were computed using the <italic>geeglm</italic> function of the <italic>geepack</italic> package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C42">HÃ¸jsgaard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Model selection was performed by excluding non-significant interactions first, and then all non-significant factors. Statistics and <italic>P</italic>-values of non-significant factors and/or interactions are reported before removal from the model.Regarding time budget analysis, the first nesting bout (N1) of males and the first foraging trip of females (T1) of the experiment were removed from analyses because first capture and treatment were carried out during this period. In addition, to homogenize the number of individuals per group, only the first seven foraging trips after treatment were considered for the analyses (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COT007F1">1</xref>), i.e. during the time that the treatment was efficient. Treatment, foraging trip (T1, T2, etc.) or nesting bout (N1, N2, etc.) ranks, and the interaction between treatment and foraging trip rank or between treatment and nesting bout rank were taken into account as fixed factors. Data obtained from males and females (partners) were analysed separately because only males were CORT treated. Wilcoxon tests were used to compare the number of foraging trips made between 1 and 15â€…days after implantation and between 1 and 21â€…days after implantation, and the total time spent at the nest during these periods between groups.Relationships between adult mass (or scaled mass index) and brood mass at the end of the treatment were estimated with Spearman correlation tests.Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) with Wilk's lambda statistics was used to compare overall isotopic signatures between groups, according to the condition of residuals normality (assessed by Shapiroâ€“Wilk test). Differences in Î´<sup>13</sup>C and Î´<sup>15</sup>N between control males and their chicks and between CORT-treated males and their chicks were assessed with Wilcoxon tests.There was no difference in the date when birds were captured and treated (control <italic>vs.</italic> CORT) at the beginning of the chick-rearing period (Wilcoxon, <italic>W</italic>â€…=â€…29, <italic>P</italic>â€…=â€…0.627).

However, nesting bouts were significantly longer in CORT-treated males compared with control birds (Wald Ï‡<sup>2</sup>â€…=â€…4.747, <italic>P</italic>â€…=â€…0.029; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COT007F2">2</xref>). Neither the nesting bout rank (Wald Ï‡<sup>2</sup>â€…=â€…0.113, <italic>P</italic>â€…=â€…0.737) nor the interaction treatmentâ€…Ã—â€…nesting bout rank (Wald Ï‡<sup>2</sup>â€…=â€…0.849, <italic>P</italic>â€…=â€…0.357) had a significant effect on the time spent on the nest. Consequently, the number of foraging trips tended to be lower, although not significantly so, in CORT-treated birds compared with control birds (5.9â€…Â±â€…0.3 <italic>vs.</italic> 6.6â€…Â±â€…0.3 foraging trips, respectively, after 15â€…days, <italic>W</italic>â€…=â€…11.5, <italic>P</italic>â€…=â€…0.087; and 8.1â€…Â±â€…0.4 <italic>vs.</italic> 9.1â€…Â±â€…0.5, respectively, after 21â€…days, <italic>W</italic>â€…=â€…13.5, <italic>P</italic>â€…=â€…0.169). The CORT-treated males spent on average 21% more time at the nest and 17% less time at sea than control males between 1 and 15â€…days after pellet implantation (8.6â€…Â±â€…0.5â€…days at the nest <italic>vs.</italic> 7.1â€…Â±â€…0.4â€…days for CORT-treated birds and controls, respectively, <italic>W</italic>â€…=â€…40, <italic>P</italic>â€…=â€…0.055; and 7.6â€…Â±â€…0.3 <italic>vs</italic>. 6.3â€…Â±â€…0.4â€…days days at sea, respectively, <italic>W</italic>â€…=â€…9, <italic>P</italic>â€…=â€…0.055).For females, the time spent on the nest was not affected by the treatment of their mates (Wald Ï‡<sup>2</sup>â€…=â€…1.637, <italic>P</italic>â€…=â€…0.201), the nesting bout rank (Wald Ï‡<sup>2</sup>â€…=â€…0.944, <italic>P</italic>â€…=â€…0.331), or the interaction of these two factors (Wald Ï‡<sup>2</sup>â€…=â€…0.357, <italic>P</italic>â€…=â€…0.550). In addition, female foraging trip duration was not affected by the partner treatment (Wald Ï‡<sup>2</sup>â€…=â€…0.902, <italic>P</italic>â€…=â€…0.342), the foraging trip rank (Wald Ï‡<sup>2</sup>â€…=â€…0.105, <italic>P</italic>â€…=â€…0.746), or the interaction of partner treatmentâ€…Ã—â€…foraging trip rank (Wald Ï‡<sup>2</sup>â€…=â€…1.779, <italic>P</italic>â€…=â€…0.182).Given that CORT-treated males spent more time at the nest while their partners did not perform longer trips, treated pairs spent more time together at the nest (Wald Ï‡<sup>2</sup>â€…=â€…8.901, <italic>P</italic>â€…=â€…0.003).

These small samples were not sufficient for CORT assays to be performed. However, whether the treatment increased CORT levels within baseline ranges or to acute stress-induced levels, both within the normal physiological range, may have different effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C51">Landys <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Corticosterone levels of treated chick-rearing male AdÃ©lie penguins were measured in a similar experiment with the same study protocol (Thierry A.M. and Raclot T., unpublished data). Blood was sampled on the day of implantation and an average of 17.9â€…Â±â€…0.2â€…days after pellet implantation and plasma kept for CORT assay. Pre-treatment CORT levels did not differ between groups (3.9â€…Â±â€…1.0 and 4.7â€…Â±â€…0.5â€…ng/ml for control birds and CORT-treated birds, respectively). Corticosterone levels had returned to initial levels by the time of the second blood sample (4.9â€…Â±â€…0.5 and 4.6â€…Â±â€…0.8â€…ng/ml for control birds and CORT-treated birds, respectively, about 18â€…days post-implantation). The return to baseline levels 18â€…days after CORT implantation is also in agreement with the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C65">SpÃ©e <italic>et al.</italic> (2011a)</xref> using similar pellets in AdÃ©lie penguins. A 2- to 4-fold increase in CORT levels was measured in CORT-treated incubating male AdÃ©lie penguins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C65">SpÃ©e <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C70">Thierry <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), i.e. below the the levels reached during capture stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C32">Cockrem <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), and within the physiological range of this species.Corticosterone pellets have been described to induce a peak-like elevation of circulating CORT levels and temporarily to remove the endogenous response to an acute stressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C56">MÃ¼ller <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In particular, highly elevated levels of CORT trigger different responses compared with slightly elevated levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C75">Wingfield <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C76">1998</xref>). Intermediate CORT levels may increase food searching in a free-living animal, while higher levels may restrict movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C19">Breuner <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C20">Breuner and Wingfield, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C36">Crossin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). In the present study, the lack of marked changes in the behaviour of male AdÃ©lie penguins on land (Raclot T., visual observations) suggests that CORT did not drastically affect the time budget of birds. Self-degradable pellets remain an efficient tool to elevate hormone levels experimentally in field studies.Whether baseline and/or stress-induced CORT levels are good predictors of fitness in free-living animals is not yet clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C21">Breuner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C16">Bonier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009a</xref>). A negative relationship between baseline glucocorticoid levels and fitness measures, mediated by environmental conditions or challenges, is described under the CORT-fitness hypothesis, with partial empirical support. Nevertheless, baseline CORT levels vary consistently among individuals, depending on environmental conditions and life-history stages, making a unidirectional link between CORT and fitness unlikely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C38">Dingemanse <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). The CORT-adaptation hypothesis expands the definition of environmental challenges to include challenges associated with reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C17">Bonier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009b</xref>), which predicts that increased reproductive demand causes increases in baseline CORT levels. The nature of the relationship between CORT and fitness, and the validity of the CORT-adaptation hypothesis, depend on the magnitude of reproductive investment, and may thus vary among species and individuals with different reproductive strategies. Understanding how CORT relates to fitness becomes even more complex when considering that behaviour, size, and morphology also affect how organisms perceive environmental signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C45">Kearney, 2006</xref>), and may therefore affect CORT levels.Negative effects of elevated CORT levels on parental care in birds have been described in many studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C63">Silverin, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C79">Wingfield and Sapolsky, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C35">Criscuolo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C4">Almasi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C41">Groscolas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C9">Angelier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C43">Horton and Holberton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C70">Thierry <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). However, the CORT-adaptation hypothesis predicts that high CORT levels support increased foraging activity and parental effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C16">Bonier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009a</xref>). Indeed, increased CORT levels induced an increase in foraging activity and parental care in female macaroni penguins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C36">Crossin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Interestingly, CORT-treated male AdÃ©lie penguins had a decreased reproductive output, while spending more time at their nest. Their females apparently did not compensate for this, because they did not modify their time budget. Likewise, female AdÃ©lie penguins were not affected by the temporary handicapping of their partner (forcing them to conduct longer trips), and had a decreased reproductive output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C13">Beaulieu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).Corticosterone treatment is known to have a negative effect on body mass, which can be explained, at least partly, by a shift in fuel utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C66">SpÃ©e <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011b</xref>). Although CORT-treated penguins fasted for longer while at the nest, they maintained a similar body condition to that of control birds and provided enough food to their remaining chicks, which had similar body mass and size to control chicks (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COT007TB1">1</xref>). Given that CORT-treated birds had a lower number of chicks to supply and knowing that foraging at sea is more costly than guarding the chicks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C24">Chappell <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>), spending more time at the nest probably allowed CORT-treated birds to maintain a similar body mass to that of control birds. Our results support the idea that increasing CORT levels may have induced birds to allocate the available energy to the benefit of body maintenance at the expense of current reproduction.Corticosterone-treated penguins had a 42% decrease in reproductive output, but all birds raised at least one chick. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C34">Criscuolo <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref> found that exogenous CORT increased the rate of egg loss of incubating female common eiders (<italic>Somateria mollissima</italic>) through a reduction in nest attentiveness associated with decreased prolactin levels. Corticosterone-treated chick-rearing AdÃ©lie penguins may have been less attentive to their nest, leading to less efficient protection of the chicks against cold or predators. Visual observations in the field do not support this idea, however, because predators are few on this part of the Dumont d'Urville colony and adverse weather did not occur much during the study period.It is possible that the quality or quantity of chick provisioning may have been reduced in CORT-treated birds. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C43">Horton and Holberton (2009)</xref> found an inhibitory effect of elevated CORT levels on chick-provisioning frequency in male white-throated sparrows (<italic>Zonotrichia albicollis</italic>). Given that the growth rate of AdÃ©lie penguin chicks is positively affected by the feeding frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C69">Takahashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), the lower reproductive output of CORT-treated males was probably caused by a reduced chick-provisioning rate.Further studies are needed to examine the timing and the causes of chick mortality (e.g. by using video recording and regular weighing of the chicks) in treated birds in order to understand better how increased CORT levels affect reproductive output.While CORT-treated penguins spent more time at their nest, they did not spend more time foraging at sea. Likewise, CORT treatment did not affect foraging trip durations of female macaroni penguins relative to control birds, but diving behaviour differed between the two groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C36">Crossin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Telemetry showed that dive parameters, such as the number of dives, the mean depth, and the number of foraging events per dive, differed between control and CORT-treated birds, with an overall positive effect of the CORT treatment on foraging behaviour and diving activity, independent of the time spent away from the colony on trips. Although we did not study the foraging behaviour of our birds in the present study, we may expect the CORT treatment to affect the birds' foraging behaviour as suggested by a preliminary study using timeâ€“depth recorders on CORT-implanted AdÃ©lie penguins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C33">Cottin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). As for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C36">Crossin <italic>et al.</italic> (2012)</xref>, AdÃ©lie penguins implanted with CORT pellets seemed to increase their diving effort, although trip duration did not change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C33">Cottin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).As mentioned above, the trip duration is not affected, but foraging parameters within the foraging trip window may be modified (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C33">Cottin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C36">Crossin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), i.e. regulation takes place at the level of the diving effort but not at the larger-scale level of the foraging trip. This seems plausible because a CORT increase induces an increase in locomotor (corresponding here to diving) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C66">SpÃ©e <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011b</xref>).Corticosterone has an inverted U-shaped doseâ€“response curve; only intermediate levels of CORT activate behaviour, while low and high levels have no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C20">Breuner and Wingfield, 2000</xref>). The CORT pellets used in our study were found to mimic metabolic, hormonal, and behavioural changes of long-term fasting in birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C66">SpÃ©e <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011b</xref>). In that study, there was a 2.5-fold increase in locomotor activity shortly after implantation in the failed breeders kept in captivity and treated with 100â€…mg of CORT, as in our study. Nevertheless, the CORT dose may have been too high to affect foraging behaviour and did not seem to affect birds' behaviour at the nest (Raclot T., personal observations).The effects of CORT on foraging behaviour might depend on the nutritional status of the birds. For example, CORT implantation in fed white-crowned sparrows (<italic>Zonotrichia leucophrys</italic>) did not affect food intake, while fasting CORT-implanted birds increased their foraging activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C10">Astheimer <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>). In our study, the nutritional status of birds was difficult to assess. Although birds were regularly feeding at sea, they regurgitated part of the food they ingested to feed their chicks. However, AdÃ©lie penguins can fast for several weeks before they reach a low threshold in their body reserves, which precedes nest abandonment to refeed at sea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C64">SpÃ©e <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Thus, it is likely that CORT-treated birds did not reach a late stage of fasting in this study.Other physiological mechanisms, such as negative feedback processes, the type and distribution of receptors within target tissues, and the concentration of corticosteroid-binding globulins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C5">Almasi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), may have prevented effects of exogenous CORT on foraging trip duration. Other endocrine factors could also modulate foraging trip durations. For example, prolactin, the main hormone involved in parental care in birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C23">Buntin, 1996</xref>), has recently been suggested to be involved in the mediation of the trade-off between the reproductive effort and self-maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C8">Angelier and Chastel, 2009</xref>). Corticosterone may indirectly affect this trade-off via a stress-induced effect on prolactin, which would then affect the trade-off between chick provisioning and self-maintenance. Besides, recent studies suggest that CORT could affect prolactin levels more directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C34">Criscuolo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C9">Angelier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C65">SpÃ©e <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011a</xref>), although such a link is not found in all species (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT007C36">Crossin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).We showed that experimentally elevated CORT levels increased the time that birds spent at their nest, but did not affect foraging trip durations, foraging sites, and diet quality in terms of isotopic signature. Interestingly, while the treatment decreased reproductive output (the number of chicks fledged per nest), it did not affect the growth of the surviving chicks.The detailed behaviour of treated birds should be examined in further studies to provide understanding of how elevated baseline CORT levels increased chick mortality. Given that seabirds are central-place foragers, feeding at sea and foraging activities also need to be monitored to test whether CORT-treated individuals could be more or less efficient in terms of prey capture, and thus more or less efficient in terms of chick provisioning.Birds have been used extensively as models to explore the ecological basis of stress and the underlying endocrine mechanisms. Ecologists and conservation biologists also use levels of stress hormones as an indicator of physiological stress in wild animals, and in extension, as a correlate of the â€˜health statusâ€™ of a population. Nevertheless, the relationships between glucocorticoids, fitness, and ultimately population dynamics are not fully understood and remain controversial depending on species, constraints, and changes in the environment. Studies of stress hormones using both correlative and experimental approaches are of great interest and are fundamental in order for conservation physiology to be successful as a discipline, helping to manage species of conservation concern facing detrimental conditions in a rapidly changing environment.We thank F.
