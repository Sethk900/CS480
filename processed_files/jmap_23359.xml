On Kiefer’s American Eucyclops (Copepoda, Eucyclopinae): redescriptions and comments on the historical records of E. delachauxi, E. prionophorus, E. bondi and E. leptacanthusAbstract The freshwater copepod genus Eucyclops contains many supposedly cosmopolitan species whose taxonomic status is still under discussion; some of them represent species complexes. The problem is not exclusive to these widespread species; there are several American Eucyclops needing a taxonomic re-evaluation. Based on the examination of Friedrich Kiefer’s collection in Karlsruhe, Germany, the type specimens of four American species of Eucyclops (E. delachauxi (Kiefer, 1926), E. prionophorus Kiefer, 1931, E. bondi Kiefer, 1934, E. leptacanthus Kiefer, 1956) were re-examined and redescribed using upgraded descriptive standards. Kiefer’s translated descriptions and unpublished original drawings of these species are also presented. Characters like the ornamentation of the antennal basis, ornamentation of intercoxal sclerites of the swimming legs 1–4, length of basipodal seta of leg 1, ornamentation of caudal rami, the presence of aesthetascs and modified setae on the antennules in male, and the structure of the male sixth leg are compared herein to aid a more accurate separation of these American species. A revision of the American records of these species confirms that some are likely to refer to undescribed species. Overall, the diversity of the American Eucyclops appears to be underestimated and certainly deserves further study.
