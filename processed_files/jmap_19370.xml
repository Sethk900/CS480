Stand level estimation of root respiration for two subtropical plantations based on in situ measurement of specific root respirationIn this Study, the stand level root respiration was estimated for two monoculture plantations: Acacia crassicarpa and Eucalyptus urophylla, based on in situ measurement of specific root respiration using simplified root chamber method. The respiration rates of fine roots (<5 mm) were significantly higher than those of coarse roots (>5 mm) for both A. crassicarpa and E. urophylla species. The root respiration of A. crossicarpa showed a clear seasonal pattern with a higher value in the wet season. For E. urophylla, the seasonal pattern was observed for fine roots but not for coarse roots. After determining the biomass of fine roots and coarse roots and their specific rates of respiration at different time points, root respiration at the stand level (R.) was estimated using a direct up-scaling model. We found that the R-a accounted for 14% and 19% of total soil respiration (R-s) for A. crassicarpa and E. urophylla, respectively. The fine (R-Tf) and coarse (R-Tc) root respiration at the stand level accounted for about 47% and 53% of the R-a for A. crassicarpa, and accounted for 58% and 42% for E. urophylla. This suggests that coarse root respiration cannot be ignored when estimating the root respiration at the stand level. Our results showed that the Q(10) values were more accurate in representing the temperature dependence when the confounding effect of soil moisture was considered. This study introduces an alternative approach to estimate stand level root respiration, but its reliability is largely dependent on the accuracy of root biomass quantification. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
