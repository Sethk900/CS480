Macroinfauna intermareal en un estuario del Sur de Chile (estuario del Rio Lingue, Valdivia)Four stations in the estuary of the Lingue River (Valdivia) were studied with the purpose of finding out the distribution and structure of the macroinfauna community. Classification method (dendrograms) revealed two groups of stations. This situation is analyzed and discussed in relation to the faunistic composition and abiotic factors, such as substrate texture and salinity of surrounding waters. The two inner stations have muddy sediments, a high content of organic matter and a notorious black reduction layer. The principal faunistical components are Polychaeta (47.7 to 87.3% of the whole macroinfauna). The other two stations (near the mouth of the estuary) have clean sands, a low content of organic matter and they do not present a black reduction layer. The principal faunistical component are crustaceans, representing about 100% of the whole macroinfauna. Density and biomass (dry weight) are highest in the two inner stations and diversity increases towards the estuary mouth. The distribution schemes are discussed and compared with patterns elaborated for marine exposed beaches of the surrounding littoral area.
