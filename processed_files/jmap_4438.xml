Soil water variability in the Weatherley grassland catchment, South Africa: II. Soil water contentAbstract Soil water content is a major factor that affects the hydrological response of a hillslope or catchment. It is therefore important to have reliable soil water content data to estimate catchment water yield. Daily soil water content (θ) data was calculated based on weekly measured and other data for the Weatherley grassland catchment in South Africa. A modelling procedure, based on the soil water balance equation and the interpretation of the physical properties of soils was used to calculate daily θ for all 28 sites for the six-year period. A statistical model performance indicated that the mean index of agreement was 0.88, root mean square error (RMSE) was 6.8 mm water per 300 mm soil and mean unsystematic RMSE to total RMSE was 93%. These results indicated that the calculated soil water contents agreed well with the measured values and could therefore be used with reasonable confidence to fill data gaps. The proposed procedure therefore affords the possibility to increase the resolution of irregular measured soil water content data. This would significantly advance the usability of such data, because the influence of rainfall events on soil water content is frequently missed by manual soil water content measurements.
