Scuttle flies (Diptera: Phoridae) of the Canary IslandsFifty-four species in 10 genera are listed for the Canary Islands. Megaselia chinyeroensis Disney sp. nov. and Microselia prescherae Disney sp. nov. are described. The hitherto unkown males of Megaselia intermedia (Santos Abreu), Metopina tanjae Disney and Prescher, the putative female of Chonocephalus bentacaisei (Santos Abreu) and the female of Megaselia apozona Schmitz are described. Discovery of errors in the original description of Megaselia striolata Schmitz means that Megaselia canaryae Disney must be synonymized with Schmitz's species.
