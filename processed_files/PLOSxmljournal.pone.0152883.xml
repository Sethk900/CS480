Likewise, future disturbances also present a challenge to prediction as their dynamics are episodic and complex and occur across a range of spatial and temporal scales. While large extreme events such as tropical cyclones, fires, or pest outbreaks can produce dramatic consequences, small fine-scale disturbance events are typically much more common and may be as or even more important. This study focuses on the impacts of these smaller disturbance events on the predictability of vegetation dynamics and carbon flux. Using data on vegetation structure collected for the same domain at two different times, i.e. â€œrepeat lidar dataâ€, we test high-resolution model predictions of vegetation dynamics and carbon flux across a range of spatial scales at an important tropical forest site at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We found that predicted height change from a height-structured ecosystem model compared well to lidar measured height change at the domain scale (~150 ha), but that the model-data mismatch increased exponentially as the spatial scale of evaluation decreased below 20 ha. We demonstrate that such scale-dependent errors can be attributed to errors predicting the pattern of fine-scale forest disturbances. The results of this study illustrate the strong impact fine-scale forest disturbances have on forest dynamics, ultimately limiting the spatial resolution of accurate model predictions.Here, we build on this previous work and use lidar data on vegetation structure collected for the same area at two different times are used to test model predictions of vegetation dynamics across a range of spatial scales at an important tropical forest study site. While multiple measures of vegetation structure are potentially relevant (e.g. biomass, basal area, etc.), we focus on height because both remote sensing and models can directly measure or predict it. Results of this study suggest that fine-scale forest disturbance events limit the spatial resolution of accurate model predictions.Primary denotes natural old-growth vegetation. Secondary denotes vegetation recovering from prior land-use (Organization for Tropical Studies, unpublished data).Mean canopy height change was determined by differencing elevation of the canopy top in 1998 and 2005 (Î”CTH, see Dubayah et al. 2010).The ED model was initialized with 1 ha lidar mean canopy top heights from 1998, and used to predict 1 ha mean canopy top height change in 2005.To test model predictions, predicted gridded changes in mean canopy height were compared to the measured gridded changes using LVIS. To ensure the fairest comparison between the model and lidar data the focus was on 1) hectares with â‰¥ 20 footprints in both 1998 and 2005 and 2) hectares classified as primary and secondary forest. The dynamics of other land-use types at La Selva, including forest plantations and selective logging, were outside the scope of this study. Model predictions of mean canopy height change were compared to observations based on both lidar measures (Î”CTH and Î”CTE). A standard t-test was used to test for differences between the model predictions and observations. A bootstrap analysis yielded similar results to the t-test.To investigate the accuracy of model predictions as a function of spatial resolution, both model predicted and observed changes in mean canopy height were aggregated from the 1 ha scale (described above) continuously to the domain scale, and compared modeled and observed changes as a function of spatial scale. Since the domain was not spatially continuous with straight boundaries, neighboring hectares could not be consistently grouped together to form the coarser aggregations. Instead, aggregations were formed by taking 1000 iterations where the hectares are randomly aggregated together at each spatial scale (e.g., for the 2 ha resolution comparison, all hectares were randomly paired and the mean from pairs was used as the canopy height at the 2 ha resolution). The root-mean-square error (RMSE) was calculated for each iteration and a mean RSME was determined for each aggregation scale.N represents the number of hectares with â‰¥ 20 lidar footprints in both 1998 and 2005.All uncertainty values are Â± 1 S.E.A statistically significant difference between the ED estimate and Î”CTH is marked by * and Î”CTE is marked by â€ .NA indicates statistical test not preformed due to small sample size.Statistical significance was assessed at the 0.05 level using both t-test and bootstrap methods; both methods agreed with one another.The model-data comparison at coarse scales (i.e. &gt;50 ha) has relatively low error (RMSE). The error increases rapidly as the spatial resolution of comparison increases. Contours denote the additional expected average RMSE using the simulator at each scale assuming potential systematic bias errors in predicted growth or mortality. Only results with no systematic bias in growth or mortality produce results of similar magnitude as those predicted by ED.Solid-line 1:1 line. Green symbols: simulator predicted height change due to growth. Red symbols: simulator predicted height change due to mortality. Blue symbols: simulator predicted net height change. Black symbols: lidar- initialized ED prediction vs. Î”CTH. Replacing the complex pattern of spatial disturbances with a uniform pattern in the simulator results in fine-resolution errors in predicted mortality that propagate to errors in net predicted height change similar to that predicted by ED.Lower and upper bounds represent the assumptions about carbon increment in hectares with height &gt; = 27.5 m. The bounds do not apply to lidar measures but are presented alongside the model bounds. Means with standard error (SE). The SE is from the aggregation of the 1 ha data and does not represent error in the 1 ha level estimates.We hypothesize that the finding of scale dependence in the predictability of vegetation dynamics found at this site is common to other forest systems. Complex fine-scale disturbance patterns are common in forests, but are not represented in current prognostic approaches. Furthermore, we expect that the steepness of the scale dependence will vary between different disturbance regimes. In a forests dominated by relatively frequent, small, and unclustered disturbance events (i.e. steep power-law size-frequency relationship of events), we expect relatively high resolutions of predictability will be possible because the vast majority of disturbance events repeat within a small units of area. In contrast, in forests dominated by more infrequent, larger, and clustered events (i.e. flatter power-law size-frequency relationship of events), we expect coarser limits to accurate predictions because the unit area required for a vast majority of events to repeat would be larger.With ever increasing advances in technology (e.g. remote sensing, computing, etc.), we live in an increasingly data-rich world. But the capacity to measure and simulate vegetation dynamics at increasingly higher resolutions does not automatically confer increased predictability at ever higher resolutions. As spatial resolution increases, at some level predictability will require corresponding advances in process representation. In particular, achieving high predictability at the highest spatial resolutions investigated here will require both data at these resolutions and new process representation in models to predict the complex spatial pattern of forest disturbance at these scales. Meanwhile, the finding of the spatial-scale dependent accuracy of model results with the current modeling approach implies there are corresponding limits to the spatial resolution of the use of these model predictions in applications and potential future land-management decisions.We gratefully acknowledge the support of the NASA Terrestrial Ecology Program and NASA Interdisciplinary Science Program in this research.
