Effect of Ca, K and B supply on growth of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.)The effect of Ca:K ratios and B nutrition was investigated using tobacco and cotton grown in Mitcherlich pots with sand. A nutrient solution with three different ratios of Ca:K and two boron levels was used. Treatments were arranged factorially (3 Ã— 2) and the tobacco and cotton trials were carried out simultaneously under identical greenhouse conditions. Both crops gave the highest yield of leaves at the low Ca:K ratio. For tobacco, where leaves are the end product, this treatment also delayed deterioration of the leaves on the plant during senescence, especially when sufficient B was supplied. This ensured cured leaves with a high sugar content and good moisture-holding capacity. For cotton, the ability of plants to retain their bolls was best at the intermediate Ca:K ratio, resulting in the highest boll yield and probably indicating a need for a higher Ca:K ratio.
