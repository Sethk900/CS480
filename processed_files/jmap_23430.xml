An unusual suite of sexual characters in three new species of Hymenorus (Coleoptera, Tenebrionidae, Alleculinae) from Guatemala and MexicoAbstract Two species, Hymenorus bifurcatus, and H. excavatus are described as new from Guatemala and the new species H. balli from both the state of Chiapas in southern Mexico and Guatemala. These three species are unique among the species of Hymenorus Mulsant, 1851 in the unusual and highly modified fifth ventrites of the male and the modified shape of the female ninth tergites. The unusual sexual characters of the males and females are illustrated with photographs. The usage of the generic names Hymenorus Mulsant versus Hymenophorus Mulsant is discussed.
