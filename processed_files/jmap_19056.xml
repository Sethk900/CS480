Effect of soil compaction and biomass removal on soil CO2 efflux in a Missouri forestForest disturbances associated with harvesting activities can affect soil properties and soil respiration. A soda-lime technique was used to measure soil carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux rates in clearcut plots of a Missouri oak-hickory (Quercus spp. L.-Carya spp. Nutt.) forest 4 years after being treated with two levels of forest biomass removal and two levels of compaction, both separate and in combinations, and an uncut control. Respiration rates were measured twice a month from mid-April through October. Soil CO2 efflux rates were significantly (p < 0.001) higher in uncut control plots than in clearcut plots, but differences between biomass removal or soil compaction treatments were not significant. Soil CO2 efflux rates were positively correlated with soil temperature. The lack of difference between soil CO2 efflux rates in weed control and no weed control subplots suggests that several more years may be required for regenerating clearcut plots to produce soil respiration rates similar to those in uncut control plots.
