Snow depth, soil freezing, and fluxes of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane in a northern hardwood forest.Soil-atmosphere fluxes of trace gases (especially nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)) can be significant during winter and at snowmelt. We investigated the effects of decreases in snow cover on soil freezing and trace gas fluxes at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, a northern hardwood forest in New Hampshire, USA. We manipulated snow depth by shoveling to induce soil freezing, and measured fluxes of N<sub>2</sub>O, methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in field chambers monthly (bi-weekly at snowmelt) in stands dominated by sugar maple or yellow birch. The snow manipulation and measurements were carried out in two winters (1997/1998 and 1998/1999) and measurements continued through 2000. Fluxes of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> showed a strong seasonal pattern, with low rates in winter, but N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes did not show strong seasonal variation. The snow manipulation induced soil freezing, increased N<sub>2</sub>O flux and decreased CH<sub>4</sub> uptake in both treatment years, especially during winter. Annual N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes in sugar maple treatment plots were 207 and 99 mg N m<sup>-;2</sup> yr<sup>-;1</sup> in 1998 and 1999 vs. 105 and 42 in reference plots. Tree species had no effect on N<sub>2</sub>O or CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes, but CH<sub>4</sub> uptake was higher in plots dominated by yellow birch than in plots dominated by sugar maple. Our results suggest that winter fluxes of N<sub>2</sub>O are important and that winter climate change that decreases snow cover will increase soil:atmosphere N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes from northern hardwood forests.
