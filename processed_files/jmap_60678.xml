Comparison and validation of MODIS and VEGETATION global LAI products over four BigFoot sites in North AmericaA new set of recently developed leaf area index (LAI) algorithms has been employed for producing a global LAI dataset at 1Â km resolution and in time-steps of 10Â days, using data from the Satellite pour l'observation de la terre (SPOT) VEGETATION (VGT) sensor. In this paper, this new LAI product is compared with the global MODIS Collection 4 LAI product over four validation sites in North America. The accuracy of both LAI products is assessed against seven high resolution ETM+ LAI maps derived from field measurements in 2000, 2001, and 2003. Both products were closely matched outside growing season. The MODIS product tended to be more variable than the VGT product during the summer period when the LAI was maximum. VGT and ETM+ LAI maps agreed well at three out of the four sites. The median relative absolute error of the VGT LAI product varied from 24% to 75% at 1Â km scale and it ranged from 34% to 88% for the MODIS LAI product. The importance of correcting field measurements for the clumping effect is illustrated at the deciduous broadleaf forest site (HARV). Inclusion of the sub-pixel land cover information improved the quality of LAI estimates for the prairie grassland KONZ site. Further improvement of the global VGT LAI product is suggested by production and inclusion of pixel-specific global foliage clumping index and forest background reflectance maps that would serve as an input into the VGT LAI algorithms.
