Spatial and temporal organization in three syntopic species of the Scinax ruber group (Anura: Hylidae) in the Atlantic rainforest, southeastern BrazilCoexistence of anuran species might lead to acoustic interference among communications, especially where species are closely related. This problem might be minimized through resource partitioning. To test this idea, we analysed calling with respect to temporal and physical space usage in three syntopic, closely related species (Scinax cuspidatus, Scinax aff. hayii and Scinax aff. x-signatus) in a temporary pond in the Atlantic rainforest. The chorus attendance of each species resulted from a different combination of factors in the rainy season. Although there was some temporal overlap of daily activity among species, peak activity time differed, particularly between the two species whose calls were most similar. Although all three species tend to aggregate in open microhabitats, their coexistence is apparently facilitated by differential use of vertical strata and organization of calling sites near the sites of conspecifics. Together, these factors apparently reduce acoustic interference among heterospecific calls.
