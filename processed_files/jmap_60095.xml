Optimal Tank Design in Water Distribution Networks: Review of Literature and PerspectivesAbstractWater distribution networks (WDN) are traditionally designed without integrating tanks in the optimization process, despite the numerous benefits tanks bring to network operation. Since 2004, a number of efforts have been made to integrate tanks, and especially consideration of tank sizing, in optimization models for WDN, but important limitations in these models have impeded their adoption. This paper reviews different approaches to including tank consideration in WDN optimization, and examines the gap between proposed models and current engineering practice. It then analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of these models and suggests a procedure for selecting the most suitable approach to real-world WDN optimization projects. Further research is proposed to improve the validity and applicability of models to decision makers and policymakers.
