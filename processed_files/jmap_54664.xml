Using a global VNIR soil-spectral library for local soil characterization and landscape modeling in a 2nd-order Uganda watershedCombining global soil-spectral libraries with local calibration samples has the potential to provide improved visible and near-infrared (VNIR, 400â€“2500 nm) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) soil characterization predictions than with either global or local calibrations alone. In this study, a geographically diverse â€œglobalâ€ soil-spectral library with 4184 samples was augmented with up to 418 â€œlocalâ€ calibration soil samples distributed across a 2nd-order Ugandan watershed to predict the amount of clay-size material (CLAY), soil organic carbon (SOC) and proportion of expansible 2:1 clays (termed â€œmontmorilloniteâ€ or MT in the global library). Stochastic gradient boosted regression trees (BRT) were employed for model construction, with a variety of calibration and validation schemes tested. Using the global library combined with 13- and 14-fold cross-validation by local profile for CLAY and SOC, respectively, yielded dambo/upland RMSD values of 89/68 g kgâˆ’ 1 for CLAY (N = 429/410) and 4.2/2.6 g kgâˆ’ 1 for SOC (N = 272/105). These results were obtained despite the challenge of combining spectral libraries constructed using different spectroradiometers and laboratory reference measurements (total combustion vs. Walkleyâ€“Black, hydrometer vs. pipette). Using only the global library, a VNIR-derived index of MT content was significantly correlated with the square root of X-ray diffraction (XRD) MT peak intensity for local dambo soils (r2 = 0.52, N = 59, p < 0.0001), an acceptable result given the semi-quantitative nature of the reference XRD method. Though VNIR predictions did not approach laboratory precision, for soil-landscape modeling VNIR characterization worked remarkably well for clay mineralogy, was adequate for mapping dambo â€œdepth to 35% clayâ€, and was insufficiently accurate for SOC mapping.
