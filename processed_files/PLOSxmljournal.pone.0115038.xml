The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.Conceived and designed the experiments: YZ SZ KM BF. Performed the experiments: YZ SZ. Analyzed the data: YZ SZ KM. Contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools: YZ SZ MA. Wrote the paper: YZ SZ KM BF MA.No specific permits were required for the described field studies. The location was not privately-owned or protected in any way, and the study did not involve endangered or protected species.The hierarchical sampling system included 4 levels (corresponding to spatial scales): 270 sampling units at the plot scale were nested within 54 sampling units at the slope position scale; 54 sampling units at the slope position scale were nested within 18 sampling units of slope scale, and 18 sampling units at the slope scale were nested within 9 sampling units at the watershed scale. For the 9 watersheds, 3 watersheds were planted in pine forest, 3 in larch forest, and 3 were natural secondary broad-leaved forest.PF-planted pine forest; LF-planted larch forest; BF-natural secondary broadleaf forest.(XLSX)We thank the following gentlemen: Zhenzhu Zhang, Rui Wang, Nianjin Yang, Jingjie Ding, YufuJia, Qianqian Jia, Tiwen Li, Huiyi Yu, Xianping Qi, YanyanTian, Xiao Yin, Jingjie Ding whom have contributed substantially to the completion of the field investigation.
