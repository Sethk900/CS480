 The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.  Conceived and designed the experiments: YZ SZ KM BF. Performed the experiments: YZ SZ. Analyzed the data: YZ SZ KM. Contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools: YZ SZ MA. Wrote the paper: YZ SZ KM BF MA.  No specific permits were required for the described field studies. The location was not privately-owned or protected in any way, and the study did not involve endangered or protected species.  The hierarchical sampling system included 4 levels (corresponding to spatial scales): 270 sampling units at the plot scale were nested within 54 sampling units at the slope position scale; 54 sampling units at the slope position scale were nested within 18 sampling units of slope scale, and 18 sampling units at the slope scale were nested within 9 sampling units at the watershed scale. For the 9 watersheds, 3 watersheds were planted in pine forest, 3 in larch forest, and 3 were natural secondary broad-leaved forest.  PF-planted pine forest; LF-planted larch forest; BF-natural secondary broadleaf forest.
