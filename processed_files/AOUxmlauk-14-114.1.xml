We used molecular phylogenetics, divergence time estimates, and population genetics to reconstruct the mode, pattern, and tempo of diversification within the wide-ranging purple swamphens (genus <italic>Porphyrio</italic>), with emphasis on the &ldquo;supertramp&rdquo; <italic>P. porphyrio</italic>. Our results suggest that the <italic>Porphyrio</italic> clade arose during the Middle Miocene in Africa, with a single colonization in the Americas and several other colonizations in Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific around 10 mya. We found that the widespread <italic>P. porphyrio</italic> is not monophyletic. Indeed, several subspecies and subspecies groups may represent species-level lineages. The <italic>P. p. melanotus</italic> lineage probably reached Australasia during the Pleistocene (600 kya), although some islands were colonized only in the past few hundred years. New Zealand, and some other islands, had previously been colonized (&sim;2.5 mya) by flying <italic>Porphyrio</italic> that evolved into flightless endemic species. Early and recent lineages are now sympatric. Widespread occupation of oceanic islands implies high dispersal and colonization rates, but gene flow probably occurs episodically and follows varying routes at different times. This pattern of colonization enables populations to differentiate and, ultimately, speciate.Dispersi&oacute;n, cuando es acompa&ntilde;ada de reducci&oacute;n en el flujo de genes y la selecci&oacute;n natural, influye en las tasas de especiaci&oacute;n entre los grupos de organismos. Aqu&iacute;, usamos filogen&eacute;tica molecular, estimaciones de tiempo de divergencia y gen&eacute;tica de poblaciones para reconstruir el modo, patr&oacute;n y tiempo de diversificaci&oacute;n en las gallinas de agua (g&eacute;nero <italic>Porphyrio</italic>) con &eacute;nfasis en el super colonizador <italic>Porphyrio porphyrio</italic>. Nuestros resultados sugieren que el clado <italic>Porphyrio</italic> surgi&oacute; en Africa durante el Mioceno Medio, con una &uacute;nica colonizaci&oacute;n en las Am&eacute;ricas y varias otras colonizaciones en el sudeste de Asia y el Indo-Pac&iacute;fico alrededor de 10 mya. La ampliamente distribuida <italic>Porphyrio porphyrio</italic> no es monofil&eacute;tica. De hecho, varias subespecies y grupos de subespecies pueden representar linajes a nivel de especie. El linaje <italic>P. p. melanotus</italic> probablemente lleg&oacute; a Australasia durante el Pleistoceno (600 kya), aunque algunas islas fueron colonizadas s&oacute;lo en los &uacute;ltimos cientos de a&ntilde;os. Nueva Zelanda, y algunas otras islas, previamente hab&iacute;an sido colonizadas (&sim; 2.5 mya) por un <italic>Porphyrio</italic> volador que evolucion&oacute; hasta convertirse en especies end&eacute;micas no voladoras. Linajes tempranos y recientes son ahora simp&aacute;tricas. La amplia presencia en las islas oce&aacute;nicas implica altas tasas de dispersi&oacute;n y colonizaci&oacute;n, pero el flujo de genes probablemente se ha producido en forma epis&oacute;dica y siguiendo diferentes rutas en diferentes momentos. Este patr&oacute;n de colonizaci&oacute;n permite a las poblaciones llegar a diferenciarse y en &uacute;ltima instancia dar lugar a nuevas especies.<italic>Palabras clave:</italic> biogeograf&iacute;a, dispersi&oacute;n, especiaci&oacute;n, filogeniaThe ability to disperse and colonize new habitats provides organisms with ecological opportunities to harvest novel resources and establish new populations. Vagrant species that reach, via long-distance dispersal, new regions or isolated islands that are thousands of kilometers from their traditional breeding range may generate new flocks of dispersers before being totally or partially displaced by more efficient competitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Diamond1">Diamond 1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Diamond2">1975</xref>). This &ldquo;supertramp&rdquo; strategy can also give rise to numerous, phenotypically distinct variants, which may lead to speciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Simpson1">Simpson 1953</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Diamond1">Diamond 1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Diamond3">Diamond et al. 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Grant1">Grant 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Whittaker1">Whittaker 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Crisp1">Crisp et al. 2011</xref>). However, for a single species to persist, without differentiation, over a large breeding range of fragmented habitat, individuals must move between habitat patches at a rate sufficient to counter the evolutionary effects of isolation. This requirement predicts that such widespread species have a high level of gene flow among populations distributed across several landscapes. Alternatively, relatively small, isolated populations can segregate and accumulate phenotypic differences if range expansion is not constant through time or if the direction of dispersal changes. Outcomes may vary, depending on the number of independent radiations, differences in diversification rates, rate and pattern of gene flow, and rapidity of species radiation following a wave of dispersal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Mayr3">Mayr and Diamond 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Moyle1">Moyle et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Cibois1">Cibois et al. 2011</xref>).Inferring the geographic origin and temporal diversification of organisms is an essential part of biogeography and depends on an accurate estimate of evolutionary relationships among species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Rosen1">Rosen 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Filardi1">Filardi and Moyle 2005</xref>). In the case of birds, enabled by flight to disperse long distances, the spatiotemporal patterns of diversification can be challenging to analyze, especially when shallow radiations on islands generate differential morphological traits that obscure evolutionary affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Filardi1">Filardi and Moyle 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Irestedt1">Irestedt et al. 2013</xref>).

Colonization of islands sometimes involves loss of the capability for further long-distance dispersal, when flight is not integral to foraging, social interaction, or predator avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-McNab1">McNab 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-McNab2">McNab and Ellis 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Steadman3">Steadman 2006</xref>). Reduction, and even loss, of flight capacity can be an adaptive response to island life, and some speciation may occur with adaptation of flightlessness, as a result of altered selective environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Mila1">Mil&aacute; et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Sly1">Sly et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Alonso1">Alonso et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Runemark1">Runemark et al. 2012</xref>).Family Rallidae (Aves: Gruiformes) is diverse and cosmopolitan. It includes common species that are good dispersers, as well as regional and island endemics. Many oceanic islands that were naturally without terrestrial mammal predators appear to have favored reversion to a terrestrial lifestyle after colonization and speciation by flying ancestors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Ripley1">Ripley 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Steadman3">Steadman 2006</xref>). This combination of high dispersal and high endemicity associated with the loss of flight makes them interesting subjects for evolutionary analysis. In particular, the large, flamboyant purple swamphens (genus <italic>Porphyrio</italic>) demonstrate extraordinary dispersal capabilities, with evidence of multiple invasions, apparently spaced out in time, that resulted in divergences of size, color, and other traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Ripley1">Ripley 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Remsen1">Remsen and Parker 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Trewick1">Trewick 1996</xref>).

The model was estimated in ModelTest version 3.7, using Akaike's Information Criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Posada1">Posada and Crandall 1998</xref>). After performing shorter test runs, we conducted 3 parallel runs of the Metropolis Coupled Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMCMC) algorithm for 5 million generations each, sampling 1 tree with associated parameter values per 5,000 generations, and employing 3 heated chains and 1 cold chain. Convergence and diagnostics of the Markov process were visualized using Tracer version 1.6 (see Acknowledgments). The first half million generations (10&percnt;) were discarded as burn-in. A burn-in of 10&percnt; gave optimal results, and we obtained effective sample sizes (ESS) &gt;200 for 95&percnt; of the parameters. The ML and Bayesian trees were viewed using FigTree version 1.4.2 (see Acknowledgments) and SplitsTree version 4.12.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Huson1">Huson and Bryant 2006</xref>). <italic>Amaurornis flavirostra</italic> was used as an outgroup to root the tree.Divergence times among lineages of <italic>Porphyrio</italic> were estimated using a relaxed Bayesian clock implemented in BEAST version 1.7.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Drummond2">Drummond et al. 2012b</xref>). For calibration constraints, we used the basal divergence estimate of <italic>Porphyrio</italic> with a normal distribution of 11&ndash;20 Ma (95&percnt; range) and the basal split of <italic>Amaurornis flavirostra</italic> and <italic>Porphyrio</italic> with a normal distribution of 27&ndash;35 Ma (95&percnt; range), as previously calculated from an analysis using a widely sampled dataset of mitochondrial and nuclear genes (Garcia-R. et al. 2014). We combined the results of 3 independent runs of 30 million generations to ensure ESS scores &gt;200 for 95&percnt; of the parameters in each run. Chains were sampled every 4,000 generations, and a burn-in of 10&percnt; (3 million generations) was used. The tree, with times of divergence and highest posterior density (HPD) intervals, was visualized using FigTree.Population-level analyses were carried out with 2 datasets: (1) concatenated mitochondrial loci CR and cyt <italic>b</italic>; and (2) the autosomal locus BFG-7. Sequence ambiguities at heterozygous sites in BFG-7 that indicated separate alleles were resolved using PHASE implemented in DnaSP version 5.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Librado1">Librado and Rozas 2009</xref>) with the default parameters. To test for intralocus recombination in BFG-7, we used the PHI test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Bruen1">Bruen et al. 2006</xref>) implemented in SplitsTree. This is a robust test that can reliably detect recombination and report few false positives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Martin1">Martin et al. 2011</xref>). We calculated the following summary statistics for genetic variation of each population in DnaSP: number of haplotypes (<italic>h</italic>), nucleotide diversity per site (&pi;), number of segregating sites (<italic>S</italic>), Watterson's estimator of per site population mutation rate (&theta;<italic><sub>W</sub></italic>), Tajima's <italic>D</italic> statistic (<italic>D</italic><sub>T</sub>), and Ramos and Rozas's <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>-test. For each population, <italic>D</italic><sub>T</sub> was also analyzed, using 10<sup>3</sup> coalescent simulations conditioned on the sample size and the observed number of segregating sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Hudson1">Hudson 1990</xref>). Demographic expansion was assessed using the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>-test implemented in DnaSP because it is the most powerful test when dealing with limited sample sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Rozas1">Rozas et al. 2003</xref>).Lynch and Crease's pairwise <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Lynch1">Lynch and Crease 1990</xref>) was calculated in DnaSP, using 5,000 replicates and a significance level of &le;0.05 to test the null hypothesis of panmixia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Raymond1">Raymond and Rousset 1995</xref>) between pairs of <italic>P. porphyrio</italic> populations in Oceania. The level of population genetic structure was tested using an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) implemented in Arlequin version 3.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Excoffier1">Excoffier et al. 2005</xref>). To complement the phylogenetic inferences, haplotype networks were constructed using Network version 4.5.1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Bandelt1">Bandelt et al. 1999</xref>) with median joining to visualize the relationship between haplotypes and their geographic distribution. A Mantel test was conducted for correlation between uncorrected mitochondrial genetic distances estimated in MEGA version 5.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Tamura1">Tamura et al. 2011</xref>) and linear geographic distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Jensen1">Jensen et al. 2005</xref>) using the ade4 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Dray1">Dray and Dufour 2007</xref>) in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-RDevelopmentCoreTeam1">R Development Core Team 2008</xref>) with 10,000 permutations.The present study includes wider taxonomic representation than the first molecular phylogenetic study of <italic>Porphyrio</italic>, which compared 4 taxa using a single gene, mitochondrial 12S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Trewick2">Trewick 1997</xref>).

The complete alignment of 6 gene fragments contained 4,304 base pairs &lsqb;bp&rsqb;, comprising 816 bp of cyt <italic>b</italic>, 699 bp of CR, 728 bp of 16S, 402 bp of 12S, 868 bp of RAG-1, and 791 bp of BFG-7. No premature stop codons were detected in the 2 protein-coding genes. Individual gene trees did not reveal spurious sequences or significant conflict among individual phylogenies. Phylogenetic analyses that included just 1 representative of each species and subspecies that had the most complete gene sets yielded similar topologies (results not shown). Topologies from ML and Bayesian analyses were congruent for the concatenated dataset. The African species <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. alleni</named-content></italic> is sister to the New World species pair <italic>P. martinica</italic> and <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. flavirostris</named-content></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-f01">Figure 1</xref>C). <italic>Porphyrio porphyrio</italic> did not form a monophyletic group.

The close similarity of <italic>P. p. pulverulentus</italic> and <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. albus</named-content></italic> sequences indicates a complex history of exchange, because their lineage is not recorded in islands between. Sequence data for <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. albus</named-content></italic> came from old and rare museum specimens, and such aDNA sources have to be treated with caution. However, consistent results were obtained from separate samples and replicate PCRs. There is the possibility of mislabeling of museum specimens, but the white plumage characteristic of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. albus</named-content></italic> is uncommon in other populations.Divergence time analysis suggests a Middle Miocene origin of diversification within <italic>Porphyrio</italic>, with the split between the lineages that led to the African species <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. alleni</named-content></italic> and to other species occurring earliest, around 14 (19&ndash;9) mya. Splitting among <italic>P. porphyrio</italic> &ldquo;subspecies&rdquo; was estimated to have occurred about 6 (11&ndash;2) mya, with a likely colonization of <italic>P. p. melanotus</italic> in Australasia occurring in the late Pleistocene (600 kya). However, an earlier colonization by a flying <italic>P. porphyrio</italic> at the start of the Pleistocene (&sim;2.5 mya) resulted in the flightless takahe endemic to New Zealand.The mitochondrial data contained 1 to 4 haplotypes (<italic>h</italic>) in each of the populations sampled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-f02">Figure 2</xref>A). Nucleotide diversity (&pi;) at sampling localities with <italic>n</italic> &ge; 2 was variable, ranging from 0.0 in Northland and Otago, New Zealand, to 0.0059 in Victoria, Australia. Zero to 12 segregating sites (<italic>S</italic>) were observed in each population, yielding a population mutation rate per site (&theta;<italic><sub>W</sub></italic>) between 0.0 and 0.0065 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-t02">Table 2</xref>). For BFG-7, two alternative haplotypes were identified for alleles possessed by heterozygous individuals. No statistically significant evidence for recombination (<italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.06) was detected using a phi test. Between 4 and 14 inferred BFG-7 sequences were sampled per population, and 1 to 4 unique haplotypes were found (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-t02">Table 2</xref>). The number of segregating sites in each population varied from 0 to 6. Aside from invariant samples from New South Wales and Western Australia (north), nucleotide diversity ranged from 0.00069 in Palmerston North, New Zealand, to 0.00440 in Victoria. This latter population also had the highest inferred population mutation rate per site (0.00414). No population showed a significantly skewed <italic>D</italic><sub>T</sub> for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or nuclear data, although power to reject the null hypothesis of neutrality may have been hampered by small sample sizes. The population-size-change (<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>) test did not find evidence of demographic expansion of the populations sampled (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-t02">Table 2</xref>).(<bold>A</bold>) Localities in Australia and New Zealand where individual <italic>Porphyrio porphyrio</italic> were sampled for population genetic analyses and haplotype networks.

Nevertheless, population genetic structuring was found among other populations more geographically remote from one another, with the exception of some of the comparisons among Western Australia (north) and Victoria, which was probably due to the low sample size (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-t03">Table 3</xref>). Analysis of BFG-7 showed little population genetic structuring (<xref ref-type="table" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-t03">Table 3</xref>) among localities at which mtDNA diversity was clearly partitioned. Significantly different values were obtained for most pairwise comparisons among Victoria populations because this location had endemic haplotypes. Consistent with the population pairwise differentiation analysis of the mitochondrial data, most genetic variation was explained by differences among populations (70.5&percnt;; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). The AMOVA of the BFG-7 data indicated that a small but significant (14&percnt;; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) component of variance was attributable among populations. Population geographic structure was evident in the mitochondrial and nuclear haplotype networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-f02">Figure 2</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-f02">2</xref>C), and the Mantel test showed a significant correlation between genetic and geographic distances among populations (<italic>r</italic> &equals; 0.508, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), even though only &sim;26&percnt; of genetic divergence was explained by geographic distance.Pairwise comparisons between populations using mtDNA data (above diagonal) and the nuclear locus BFG-7 (below diagonal).

This interpretation is, however, based on surviving or recently extinct lineages only; other colonizations are represented by fossils on Oceanic islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Steadman1">Steadman 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Steadman3">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Steadman4">Steadman et al. 1999</xref>) or have left no trace at all. The most likely area of origin of <italic>Porphyrio</italic> is Africa, with colonization westward into the Americas and several other colonizations northeastward (Europe, Asia, and Oceania) during the Miocene and Pleistocene. The oldest split among the currently recognized <italic>P. porphyrio</italic> lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-f01">Figure 1</xref>C, clade A) occurred in the Late Miocene (&sim;6 mya), giving rise to <italic>P. p. porphyrio</italic> on the Mediterranean coast of Europe and <italic>P. p. indicus</italic> in Indonesia. Further diversification took place during the Pliocene, giving rise to <italic>P. p. madagascariensis</italic> in Africa and a radiation into Oceania.The unique sequence obtained from the extinct <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. albus</named-content></italic> of Lord Howe Island suggests a close affinity to Philippine <italic>P. p. pulverulentus</italic>, indicating that it was perhaps a white color variant founded from <italic>P. p. pulverulentus</italic> migrants. The flightless status of <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. albus</named-content></italic> appears to be equivocal, and the population seems to have been polymorphic for plumage, with a high frequency of white individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-White1">White 1790</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Hindwood1">Hindwood 1940</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Greenway1">Greenway 1967</xref>). Aberrations in color have been found in some insular populations, caused perhaps by an allele fixed through a founder effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Cunningham1">Cunningham 1955</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Steadman3">Steadman 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Uy1">Uy et al. 2009</xref>).

The Lord Howe population may have been established from a small number of colonizing individuals from the Philippines during the late Pleistocene (&sim;500 kya), but this would have involved dispersal from the Philippines to Lord Howe Island over other islands. We remain cautious about the short DNA sequence obtained from <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. albus</named-content></italic>.Despite the appearance that flight is used only infrequently among <italic>P. porphyrio</italic> subspecies, the lineage has dispersed, colonized, and established populations multiple times across open expanses of water. Haplotypes from Indonesia (a specimen from Java is closely related to a specimen from the Philippines) and New Caledonia (specimens from this locality are closely related to specimens from localities as far away as Sulawesi and Palau) support the inference of exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-f01">Figure 1</xref>C). Although rare misplaced haplotypes of this sort might be evidence of ongoing exchange among island populations, they could also be the product of incomplete lineage sorting or past migration events.<italic>Porphyrio p. melanotus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-f01">Figure 1</xref>C, clade B) appears to have entered Australasia within the past 600,000 yr, but bone deposits show a more recent arrival on some remote islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Millener1">Millener 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Taylor1">Taylor 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Steadman3">Steadman 2006</xref>).

Within the Australia&ndash;New Zealand geographic region, the distribution of genetic variability (phylogenetic analysis, <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub>, AMOVA, haplotype networks, and Mantel test) indicates that the genetic structure of <italic>P. p. melanotus</italic> populations is not homogeneous. This lineage may have originated in Wallacea, and eustatic sea-level changes could have aided colonization by reducing overwater dispersal distances.

This colonization pattern has created the allopatric distribution currently shown in Oceania. We note that higher genetic diversity in Australia than across the Tasman Sea reflects a recent arrival in New Zealand and indicates an influence of distribution due to persistence of habitat rather than geographic distance correlated with human settlement and clearance of forest.Pairwise differences among Australasian populations were higher for the mtDNA data than for the nuclear DNA gene.

The mismatch between plumage patterns and the distribution of neutral population genetic markers suggests that differentiation in color and other traits have arisen rapidly in <italic>Porphyrio</italic> and are subject to selection in local environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Mayr2">Mayr 1954</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Nosil1">Nosil et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Feder1">Feder et al. 2012</xref>) or to stochastic genetic drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Clegg1">Clegg et al. 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Clegg2">2002b</xref>). The lack of sorting at the BFG-7 locus suggests that fixed plumage-color differences among populations are not the result of drift but are perhaps better explained by &ldquo;purifying&rdquo; sexual selection.Selection that results in character divergence among populations can occur without being detectable by neutral genetic markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Charlesworth3">Charlesworth and Charlesworth 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Nosil1">Nosil et al. 2009</xref>). There may be lineages with genomic region(s) involved in adaptive divergence, and these regions may respond independently to environment pressures via selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Schneider1">Schneider et al. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Clegg1">Clegg et al. 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Clegg2">2002b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Schluter1">Schluter 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Via1">Via 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Cooke1">Cooke et al. 2012</xref>). Appearance is a trait that is important in assortative mating by individuals within a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Schluter1">Schluter 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Maan1">Maan and Seehausen 2011</xref>) and is strongly implicated in the behavior of communally breeding <italic>P. p. melanotus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Jamieson1">Jamieson 1988</xref>). As such, it may drive monomorphism in local populations. Selection on mate choice and kin fitness likely maintains local population phenotypes in stable frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Andersson1">Andersson et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Eaton1">Eaton 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Johnsen1">Johnsen et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Pryke1">Pryke and Griffith 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-132-1-140-Murphy1">Murphy 2008</xref>).Although <italic>P. p. melanotus</italic> is not the lineage that gave rise to the flightless insular species of New Zealand (<italic>P. mantelli</italic> and <italic>P. hochstetteri</italic>), the recent success of <italic>P. p. melanotus</italic> in reaching several remote islands in the Pacific is testimony to the high success rate of dispersal and colonization. However, the restriction of gene flow evident in <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> values suggests that range expansion is probably episodic, and this enhances the opportunity for speciation and establishment of reproductive barriers. Sexual selection could help drive locus-specific evolution without being evident in genes that are (with respect to those traits) neutral, and reproductive isolation could evolve as a consequence of local adaptation and selection on characters involved in mate choice and inclusive fitness by way of mating behavior.The sampling of <italic>Porphyrio</italic> species and the extensive sampling of <italic>P. porphyrio</italic> in Africa, Europe, Asia, and Oceania were supplemented by contributions from museum collections, researchers, and institutions.
