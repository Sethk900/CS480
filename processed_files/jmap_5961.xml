The effects of image misregistration on the accuracy of remotely sensed change detectionImage misregistration has become one of the significant bottlenecks for improving the accuracy of multisource data analysis, such as data fusion and change detection. In this paper, the effects of misregistration on the accuracy of remotely sensed change detection were systematically investigated and quantitatively evaluated. This simulation research focused on two interconnected components. In the first component, the statistical properties of the multispectral difference images were evaluated using semivariograms when multitemporal images were progressively misregistered against themselves and each other to investigate the band, temporal, and spatial frequency sensitivities of change detection to image misregistration. In the second component, the ellipsoidal change detection technique, based on the Mahalanobis distance of multispectral difference images, was proposed and used to progressively detect the land cover transitions at each misregistration stage for each pair of multitemporal images. The impact of misregistration on change detection was then evaluated in terms of the accuracy of change detection using the output from the ellipsoidal change detector. The experimental results using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery are presented. It is interesting to notice that, among the seven TM bands, band 4 (near-infrared channel) is the most sensitive to misregistration when change detection is concerned. The results from false change analysis indicate a substantial degradation in the accuracy of remotely sensed change detection due to misregistration. It is shown that a registration accuracy of less than one-fifth of a pixel is required to achieve a change detection error of less than 10%
