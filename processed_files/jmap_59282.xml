Simulation and Optimization Modeling for the Management of Groundwater Resources. II: Combined ApplicationsAbstractThe world population is increasing continuously and is expected to reach the 9.5 billion mark in 2050 from the current 7.1 billion. The importance of the groundwater resources is also increasing with the increase in population, because the quality and quantity of water resources are continuously declining because of urbanization, contamination, and climate change impact. Thus, under the current environment, the conservation and management of groundwater resources is a critical challenge for fulfilling the rising water demand for agricultural, industrial, and domestic uses. Various simulation and optimization approaches have been used to solve the groundwater management problems. Optimization methods have proved to be of great importance when used with simulation models, and the combined use of these two approaches gives the best results. The main objective of this review is to analyze combined uses of simulation and optimization modeling approaches and to provide an impression of their applications reported in literature. In addition to traditional optimization techniques, this paper highlights the application of computational intelligence techniques, such as artificial neural networks, response matrix approach, and multiobjective approach. Conclusions are drawn based on this review, which could be useful for system managers and planners for selecting the best suitable technique for their specific uses.
