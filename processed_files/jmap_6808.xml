Growth and production of Vicia dasycarpa Ten., Namoi as influenced by an oat support crop and nitrogen fertilizerThe performance of Vicia dasycarpa cv. Namoi in pure stand and mixed with oats at four densities, grown at three levels of N fertilizer, was studied in the field under irrigation. Both the increased plant density of oats and N fertilizer reduced the percentage vetch in the mixtures. However, the percentage vetch in all mixtures increased as the growing season progressed. Compared to pure vetch, admixing oats increased total yields significantly, and the mixtures also responded positively to N application. On the other hand, the different treatments did not differ significantly in total crude protein production. It was concluded that Namoi is an excellent legume for combining with oats for high yields of good quality fodder. S. Ah. J. Plant Soil 1984, 1: 79â€“82
