Submerged Flows over Rectangular Weirs of Finite Crest LengthAbstractThis work presents a critical analysis of submerged flow over rectangular weirs of finite crest length. For finite crest length weirs, because the existing data sets are not extensive, new experiments for these weirs with sharp-edged and rounded crest were conducted. Based on these data, a diagram is developed to show the variation of the normalized tailwater depth with ho/L where ho is the free flow head and L is the length of the crest, to predict the onset of submergence or the modular limit. Water surface profiles of flow over weirs of finite crest length with square-edge and rounded crests were plotted to study the formation of waves in modular and submerged conditions. Characteristics length scales such as wave length and amplitude at the modularity limit and the location of the first trough downstream of the weir were measured to generalize surface profiles at different flow discharges. An empirical equation for the discharge reduction factor was also formulated. This equation has two exponents with different values for several classes of finite crest length weirs with either square edged or rounded crest.
