Female lifeâ€history characteristics of the Mosor rock lizard, Dinarolacerta mosorensis (KolombatoviÄ‡, 1886) from Montenegro (Squamata: Lacertidae)Analysis of the female life history of the poorly studied endemic Balkan lizard species Dinarolacerta mosorensis was conducted on three population samples from Montenegro. One clutch is produced annually. Females mature at body sizes of 56â€“57Â mm snoutâ€“vent length (SVL), attained at age 3â€“4 years. SVL increases with age. The average clutch size ranged from 4.3 to 5.2 eggs, and was significantly positively correlated with maternal SVL in two population samples. There were no tradeâ€offs between egg size/offspring size and clutch size, nor between variation in egg size/offspring size and maternal SVL. The incubation period averaged 26.5 days, while hatching success in captivity was 72%. Significant positive correlations were found between the hatchling mass and egg mass and size, and also between the hatchling total length and egg width and volume. There was a significant negative relationship between the hatchling mass and incubation duration.
