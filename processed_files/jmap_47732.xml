Low intensity surface fire instigates movement by adults of Calosoma frigidum (Coleoptera, Carabidae)Abstract The genus Calosoma (Coleoptera: Carabidae) is a group of large, sometimes ornate beetles, which often voraciously attack caterpillars. Many studies have reported Calosoma beetles being highly conspicuous during defoliator outbreaks. Based on observations of individual beetle behavior, patterns of activity density and phenology we provide a hypothesis on how environmental cues may synchronize Calosoma activity with periods of high defoliation. We have observed that adults of Calosoma frigidum construct underground burrows similar to those reported to be created by larvae for pupation. We propose that small increases in soil surface temperature caused either by defoliation events or decreased albedo of blackened, burned soil causes beetles to leave their underground burrows and begin foraging. Indirect support for this hypothesis comes from high levels of adult Calosoma frigidum collected in relatively small patches of burned forest (<200m2) relative to the surrounding mosaic of unburned forest shortly after a prescribed surface burn.
