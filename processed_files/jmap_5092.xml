Historical perspective, new contributions and an enlightening dispersal mechanism for the endogean genus Typhlocharis Dieck 1869 (Coleoptera: Carabidae: Trechinae)A historical review of the study of genus Typhlocharis and a synthesis of current knowledge are carried out, providing a historical context for the description of a new species in the province of Alicante (Spain). Relevant data on the biotic and abiotic environment where the species lives are also provided. With regard to its taxonomic position, it is affiliated with the Typhlocharis monastica group, although it is necessary to redefine that group. The most plausible hypothesis for the unusual presence of unguiform gonocoxites in the genus Typhlocharis and the implications for the systematics of the group are discussed. Finally, a dispersal mechanism for Typhlocharis that would explain its wide distribution in the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa is proposed.
