Optimization of Well Field Operation: Case Study of Søndersø Waterworks, DenmarkAbstractAn integrated hydrological well field model (WELLNES) that predicts the water level and energy consumption in the production wells of a waterworks is used to optimize the management of a waterworks with the speed of the pumps as decision variables. The two-objective optimization problem of minimizing the risk of contamination from a nearby contaminated site and minimizing the energy consumption of the waterworks is solved by genetic algorithms. In comparison with historical values, significant improvements in both objectives can be obtained. If the existing on/off pumps are changed to new variable-speed pumps, it is possible to save 42% of the specific energy consumption and at the same time improve the risk objective function. The payback period of investing in new variable speed pumps is only 3.1 years, due to the large savings in electricity. The case study illustrates the efficiency and applicability of the developed modeling framework.
