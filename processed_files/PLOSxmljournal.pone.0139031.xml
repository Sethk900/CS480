At some point in their history, most forests in the Mediterranean Basin have been subjected to intensive management or converted to agriculture land. Knowing how forest plant communities recovered after the abandonment of forest-management or agricultural practices (including livestock grazing) provides a basis for investigating how previous land management have affected plant species diversity and composition in forest ecosystems. Our study investigated the consequences of historical â€œland managementâ€ practices on present-day Mediterranean forests by comparing species assemblages and the diversity of (i) all plant species and (ii) each ecological group defined by speciesâ€™ habitat preferences and successional status (i.e., early-, mid-, and late-successional species). We compared forest stands that differed both in land-use history and in successional stage. In addition, we evaluated the value of those stands for biodiversity conservation. The study revealed significant compositional differentiation among stands that was due to among-stand variations in the diversity (namely, species richness and evenness) of early-, intermediate-, and late-successional species. Historical land management has led to an increase in compositional divergences among forest stands and the loss of late-successional forest species.  All plant surveys were performed under permits issued by the municipal councils of Nueno and Arguis, and by the Director of the Parque Natural de la Sierra y CaÃ±ones de Guara, AragÃ³n, Spain.  The location of the study area in Spain (left panel), and the locations of the stands that were surveyed in the Central Pre-Pyrenees (right panel) (AB Abena, AG Arguis, AR Ara, BE BelsuÃ©, IB Ibort, IP Ipies, LU Lucera, NO Nocito, RA Rasal, RP Rapun).  FORTYPE: forest type; AGE: mean stand tree age; CVAGE: coefficient of variation of stand age; CANCOV: canopy cover; SF: secondary growth stand; CS: abandoned coppice stand; EA: even-aged stand; UEA: uneven-aged stand. CANCOV is reported for the three transects of each stand.  To quantify the effects of the explanatory variables (AGE, CVAGE, FORTYPE, and CANCOV) on species composition, we used a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), which is a multivariate, nonparametric analogue of the univariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). The species abundance data (all species included) were subjected to PERMANOVA using the Bray-Curtis distance measure and 10000 permutations. To identify patterns in the compositional variation of plant communities among stand types (i.e., young vs. old, even-aged vs. uneven-aged, secondary growth vs. abandoned coppice stands), we used unconstrained ordination, non-metrical multidimensional scaling (NMDS). In addition, to test for the effect of canopy cover, this variable was plotted as a smooth surface in an ordination diagram.  The PERMANOVA analysis revealed that plant species composition differed significantly between stand types (i.e., young vs. old, even-aged vs. uneven-aged, secondary growth vs. abandoned coppice stands). In addition, canopy cover â€œCANCOVâ€ and plant species composition were significantly correlated.  AGE: Stand Age; CVAGE: coefficient of variation of stand age; FORTYPE: forest type; CANCOV: Canopy Cover. R 2  is the variance (%) explained by each variable.  AS: all plant species; ES: Early-successional species; IS: Intermediate-successional species; LS: Late-successional species. Significant effects (P &lt; 0.05) are shown in bold. R 2  is the variance (%) explained by each significant explanatory variable.  Species richness and evenness (AS: all plant species; ES: Early-successional species; IS: Intermediate-successional species; LS: Late-successional species) as influenced by stand age â€œAGEâ€ (O: old stands; Y: young stands), age structure of stand â€œCVAGEâ€ (EA: even-aged stands; UEA: Uneven-aged stands), and forest type â€œFORTYPEâ€ (SF: secondary growth stands; CS: abandoned coppice stands).
