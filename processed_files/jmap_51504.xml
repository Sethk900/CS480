Effects of a native parasitic plant on an exotic invader decrease with increasing host ageInfection by parasitic plants has been considered as an effective method for controlling invasive plants because the parasites partially or completely absorb water, nutrients, and carbohydrates from their host plants, suppressing the vitality of the host. Our study verified that younger and smaller Bidens pilosa plants suffer from higher levels of damage and are less likely to recover from infection by the parasitic plant Cuscuta australis than relatively older and larger plants, suggesting that Cuscuta australis is only a viable biocontrol agent for younger Bidens pilosa plants. Understanding changes in the interactions between parasitic plants and their hosts in relation to ontogenetic changes in the hosts is crucial for successful use of parasitic plants as biological controls. We investigated growth, photosynthesis and chemical defences in different-aged Bidens pilosa plants in response to infection by Cuscuta australis. We were particularly interested in whether plant responses to parasite infection change with changes in the host plant age. Compared with the non-infected B. pilosa, parasite infection reduced total host biomass and net photosynthetic rates, but these deleterious effects decreased with increasing host age. Parasite infection reduced the concentrations of total phenolics, total flavonoids and saponins in the younger B. pilosa but not in the older B. pilosa. Compared with the relatively older and larger plants, younger and smaller plants suffered from more severe damage and are likely less to recover from the infection, suggesting that C. australis is only a viable biocontrol agent for younger B. pilosa plants.
