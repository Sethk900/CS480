Consequently, many studies have analyzed the performance of certain groups as indicator taxa. However, in addition to knowing whether certain groups can adequately represent the biodiversity as a whole, we must also know whether they show similar responses to the main structuring processes affecting biodiversity. Here we present an application of the metacommunity framework for evaluating the effectiveness of biodiversity indicators. Although the metacommunity framework has contributed to a better understanding of biodiversity patterns, there is still limited discussion about its implications for conservation and biomonitoring. We evaluated the effectiveness of indicator taxa in representing spatial variation in macroinvertebrate community composition in Atlantic Forest streams, and the processes that drive this variation. We focused on analyzing whether some groups conform to environmental processes and other groups are more influenced by spatial processes, and on how this can help in deciding which indicator group or groups should be used. We showed that a relatively small subset of taxa from the metacommunity would represent 80% of the variation in community composition shown by the entire metacommunity. Moreover, this subset does not have to be composed of predetermined taxonomic groups, but rather can be defined based on random subsets. We also found that some random subsets composed of a small number of genera performed better in responding to major environmental gradients. There were also random subsets that seemed to be affected by spatial processes, which could indicate important historical processes. We were able to integrate in the same theoretical and practical framework, the selection of biodiversity surrogates, indicators of environmental conditions, and more importantly, an explicit integration of environmental and spatial processes into the selection approach.(A) In the main patterns in community composition; (B) Constrained by environmental variables; (C) Constrained by spatial variables.

The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is one of the most emblematic examples of this challenge, as this biome ranks among the top five biodiversity hotspots in the world. Taking our dataset as an example, if there were no financial, practical or personal constraints, we could recommend to decision-makers that all the 242 macroinvertebrates that we analyzed here should be monitored across these streams. However, this is not feasible because of the shortage of time, money, and personnel with taxonomic skills. Opportunely, our results indicate that highly diverse groups can be monitored using a few selected groups. A relatively small subset (a number between 1/4 and 1/3 of the total) would represent around 80% of the total variation in metacommunity composition. By using this subset, we would also obtain similar environmental and spatial models to those obtained by using the entire metacommunity. Surprisingly, this subset does not have to be composed of certain predetermined (in general, taxonomically defined) indicator taxa; on the contrary, it could be defined with an intensive computational search. Moreover, we show that certain random subsets composed of even fewer genera (around 5% of the total richness) could perform much better in responding to environmental (species sorting sets) and spatial gradients than the indicator taxa.(PDF)(PDF)(XLSX)(XLSX)(XLSX)We thank Amanda Winegardner, Ingrid Ng and Rafael Loyola for providing valuable comments during the preparation of this study.
