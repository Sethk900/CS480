Factors influencing anuran distribution in coastal dune wetlands in southern BrazilWe investigated the potential role of hydroperiod and habitat structural complexity as explanatory factors defining richness, abundance and spatial and temporal distribution of anurans in wetlands of coastal dunes. This survey was performed in 15 wetlands along the Atlantic coastal zone of southern Brazil. We identified 10 anuran species (nine in the adult and eight in the tadpole stage) distributed in seven genera from five families. The adult richness and abundance varied among the hydroperiod classes, but without temporal variations. Both tadpole richness and abundance varied temporally and both were influenced by hydroperiod. Adult anuran composition was associated with dry months and wetland area, whereas tadpole composition was associated with emergent and floating macrophytes, wetland area and vegetation cover. This study identified the importance of habitat structural complexity and hydroperiod in spatialâ€“temporal distribution models of anurans.
