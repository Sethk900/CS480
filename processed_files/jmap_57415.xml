Advanced Treatment of Vitamin C Wastewater by Coupling Electrochemical Oxidation and an Integrated BioreactorAbstractThis study aims to establish a new technology for the advanced treatment of vitamin C (VC) wastewater by coupling electrochemical oxidation (EO) and an integrated bioreactor. Characteristics of organic compounds in the effluent from biotreatment of VC wastewater were analyzed. EO was used to break the chromophore functional groups of these organic compounds and improve biodegradability of the effluent. The subsequent integrated bioreactor was proposed to further degrade organic compounds in the effluent from the EO. The optimum operation parameters of this combined technology and the effect of cosubstrate on the removals of color, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and nitrogen were investigated. EO could remove color with the maximum removal of 183° and improve the biochemical oxygen demand-to-COD ratio effectively from 0.07 to 0.24. Effluent COD and color of the integrated bioreactor decreased from 111.4  mg/L and 60° without glucose addition to 100.9  mg/L and 50° with glucose addition. Concomitantly, total nitrogen removal efficiency increased sharply from 20.2% to 84.2%. Infrared spectra showed that the combined technology removed COD and color by breaking chromophoric functional groups. The combination of EO and integrated bioreactor could be an effective, sustainable, and nonsecondary pollution technology for the advanced treatment of VC wastewater.
