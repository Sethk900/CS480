Respiration rate of broadleaved Korean pine forest ecosystem in Changbai Mountains.In this paper, the respiration rates of soil, foliage, and stem and branch in the broadleaved Korean pine forest ecosystem of Changbai Mountains were measured by Li-6400 CO2 analysis system in 2003, with the microclimate factors determined synchronously. The correlation models of ecosystem respiration With environmental factors were established, and the respiration rate of each component of the ecosystem was estimated based on the vegetation characteristics of the broadleaved Korean pine forest. The results showed that the annual total respiration rate of the ecosystem was 1 602. 8 g C (.) m(-2), with a mean of (4.37 +/- 2.98) mu mol (.) m(-2) (.) s(-1), and the respiration of soil, foliage, and stem and branch contributed about 63%, 21%, and 16% of the total, respectively. There was a significant correlation between system respiration and daily mean air and soil temperature, and about 87% and 95% of the ecosystem respiration could be explained by the air and soil temperature, respectively.
