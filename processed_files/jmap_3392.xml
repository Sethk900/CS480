Effects of prescribed fire on movements of female Sage Grouse from breeding to summer rangesWe compared summer movement patterns of female Sage Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) in southeastern Idaho before (1987-1989) and after (1990-1992) a prescribed fire which removed vegetation cover, primarily Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata wyomingensis), from approximately 57% of a 5800 ha area. Grouse moved 1-69 km ((x) over bar = 17.8 +/- 2.0 km [SE]; N = 81) from breeding and nesting areas to summer ranges, predominantly in northwest or southwest directions during the 6-year period. There was no difference in timing, distance, or direction moved between birds captured in burned and unburned habitats. The data provided further evidence of traditional migration routes for Sage Grouse breeding and nesting in the Big Desert.
