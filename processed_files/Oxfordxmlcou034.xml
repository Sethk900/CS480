We studied carbon and nitrogen acquisition and water-use efficiency across the ontogeny of a rare cycad in relation to environmental gradients. Increased water-use efficiency at lower drier elevations and nitrogen fixation at upper elevations with nutrient poor soils may help maintaining the lower and upper altitudinal species range limits  Functional traits can drive plant responses to short- and long-term stressful conditions, with potential effects on species persistence in local habitats, changes in population size and structure, and potential species range shifts in changing environments. We investigated whether ecophysiological traits in a rare cycad vary along environmental gradients and with ontogeny to understand intra-specific resource-use variation (e.g. symbiotic nitrogen fixation, nitrogen- and water-use efficiency) and possible species adaptations for different environments. Environmental gradients were characterized with 14 soil and topographic variables. Nitrogen- and water-use efficiency improved with ontogeny (from seedling to juvenile and adult stages) but declined as soil fertility decreased with increasing elevation. Conversely, reliance on symbiotic nitrogen fixation increased with elevation and varied slightly with ontogeny. Improved water-use efficiency at lower elevation and nitrogen fixation at higher elevation may represent key functional strategies for maintaining the lower and upper altitudinal species range limits, especially in arid environments where stressful conditions are intensifying due to climatic and land-use changes. In addition to facilitation linked to the regeneration niche, improved resource-use efficiency linked to the adult niche may strongly influence cycad distribution and persistence in contemporary environments. A functional approach to conservation of rare or endangered plant species may be needed in order to target the most sensitive stages to changing environmental conditions and to better understand potential range shifts and adaptive responses to global land-use and climate changes.  Functional traits can drive plant responses to short- and long-term stressful environmental conditions, such as water or nutrient stress, which represent two major environmental filters in arid environments ( Chapin  et al. , 1987 ;  Condit  et al. , 2013 ). Predictability of trait function in response to multiple stressors during species ontogeny can provide deeper insights into survival at sensitive early life stages (e.g. seedlings) and long-term species persistence in changing environments ( Chapin  et al. , 1993 ;  Fonseca  et al. , 2000 ;  Cavender-Bares  et al. , 2004 ). Functional traits related to resource acquisition (e.g. carbon assimilation) are often positively correlated with soil nutrient content, whereas the opposite relationship is usually observed for biological fixation of atmospheric nitrogen ( Aerts and Chapin, 1999 ;  Zahran, 1999 ;  Bai  et al. , 2009 ;  OrdoÃ±ez  et al. , 2009 ). In addition to variation along environmental gradients, leaf traits can also vary predictably with ontogeny. For example, photosynthetic rates on a leaf area basis and nitrogen fixation usually tend to increase with ontogeny ( Donovan and Ehleringer, 1991 ;  Fredericksen  et al. , 1996 ;  Cavender-Bares and Bazzaz, 2000 ;  Ishida  et al. , 2005 ). It is therefore expected that trait function should vary predictably along resource gradients and ontogeny, with potential effects on species performance and future species distribution.  Current gymnosperm (e.g. cycads, conifers) distribution is thought to be related to the contraction to refuge habitats due to past climatic changes and the poor competition with angiosperm species due to reproductive and physiological constraints ( Bond, 1989 ;  Becker, 2000 ;  Preece  et al. , 2007 ;  Ãlvarez-YÃ©piz  et al. , 2014 ). Ecophysiological traits can give us insights into plant responses to short- and long-term water stress, the most important limiting factor for plants in arid ecosystems. Functional short-term responses to water stress may include lower carbon assimilation and higher water-use efficiency, while longer-term responses may involve additional morphological adaptations, such as sclerophyllous leaves to improve resistance against water loss and physical damage ( Chaves  et al. , 2003 ,  2009 ). Leaf shedding in response to drought is an obvious adaptation of drought-deciduous species from arid environments, such as tropical dry forest systems ( Bullock and Solis-Magallanes, 1990 ;  Olivares and Medina, 1992 ). However, evergreen species from tropical dry forests, such as the long-lived, N 2 -fixer cycad  Dioon sonorense , should have physiological adaptations or strategies to resist water stress while maintaining a positive carbon balance [e.g. higher water-use efficiency (WUE);  Givnish, 2002 ; Nobel, 2009], which is especially important at the seedling stage.  Plant functional traits are usually studied at the regeneration niche because higher mortality rates during early ontogeny make this phase a critical period for selection of plant traits ( Reich, 2000 ). During this phase, facilitation by canopy shading can provide protection and a less fluctuating microenvironment that may increase seedling survival and growth, especially in species from arid or other drought-prone environments, such as cacti, pines or cycads ( Turner  et al. , 1966 ;  Valiente-Banuet and Ezcurra, 1991 ;  DovÄiak  et al. , 2005 ;  Ãlvarez-YÃ©piz  et al. , 2014 ). The regeneration niche, commonly defined by the environmental conditions in early plant ontogeny ( Grubb, 1977 ), therefore seems vital for successful survival of early plant life stages. Nonetheless, gradual recruitment into more advanced juvenile and adult life stages is equally critical for species population persistence (e.g.  DovÄiak  et al. , 2001 ;  Ãlvarez-YÃ©piz  et al. , 2011 ). Species adaptations related to the adult niche should be particularly relevant for the long-term persistence and future distribution of long-lived species, such as many gymnosperms (including cycads), for which adult plants contribute the most to species population growth rates ( Silvertown  et al. , 1996 ;  Raimondo and Donaldson, 2003 ;  Ãlvarez-YÃ©piz  et al. , 2011 ). Therefore, information on species resource-use strategies (e.g. water, carbon and nitrogen utilization) at different ontogenetic stages and in different environments may be particularly useful in order to implement better conservation practices, especially during extreme climatic events or increasing aridity over longer temporal scales, as projected by various climate-change scenarios ( Easterling  et al. , 2000 ;  Walther  et al. , 2002 ;  Choat  et al. , 2012 ;  Dai, 2013 ).  Assuming that the quantification of species functional traits by life stage can help us to gain insights into intra-specific resource-use variation and possible species adaptations for different environments during their ontogeny, we specifically asked: does the lower resource use in seedlings and juveniles more strongly reflect an adaptation of the younger life stages to different environmental conditions or developmental constraints that prevent them from achieving more advantageous trait values? We expect carbon assimilation and nitrogen- and water-use efficiency to be positively related to soil fertility, while symbiotic nitrogen fixation should be related negatively to soil fertility. However, as ontogeny progresses plants should become more efficient (i.e. higher water-use efficiency, photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency and symbiotic nitrogen fixation) given the potential adaptive significance of these key functional strategies for long-lived gymnosperms inhabiting water- and nutrient-limited environments.

Habitat of the rare cycad  D.â€…sonorens  e  in the ecotone between tropical dry and oak forests in northwestern Mexico. Photo credit: J.C.Ã.-Y.  We collected a total of 81 leaf samples from the 27 study plots located along an elevation gradient (500â€“1000â€…m above sea level) where the nine study populations occur (i.e. three plots per population). We collected one composite leaf sample from three different leaflets from a randomly selected plant per life stage (seedling, juvenile and adult). Life-stage classification was based on individual height and reproductive characteristics ( Ãlvarez-YÃ©piz  et al. , 2011 ), as follows: seedlings, &lt;50â€…cm tall; juveniles, â‰¥50 but &lt;100â€…cm tall; and adults, â‰¥100â€…cm tall. Measurements of average net CO 2  assimilation ( A ) and transpiration ( E ) rates were performed on the same 81 plants used for leaf tissue collection prior to collecting leaf samples. We obtained 10 readings (per plant per life stage) from three fully developed and exposed leaflets placed within the chamber. Gas-exchange measurements were conducted at ambient conditions of (chamber) temperature (34.02â€…Â±â€…5.63Â°C), CO 2  (391.27â€…Â±â€…22.66â€…ppm) and photosynthetically active radiation (925.57â€…Â±â€…483.81 photosynthetic photon flux density) between 10.00 and 12.00â€…h at the beginning of the rainy season (June/July) using an LCpro+ Portable Photosynthesis System (ADC BioScientific Ltd, Great Amwell, Hertfordshire, UK).  All leaf samples were analysed for weight percentage of nitrogen ( N ) and for Î´ 13 C and Î´ 15 N composition. Standard procedures were followed to process and analyse 2.5â€“3.0â€…mg of solid samples for carbon and nitrogen concentrations and carbon (Î´ 13 C) and nitrogen (Î´ 15 N) stable isotope composition using a Costech Elemental Analyzer coupled to a ThermoFinnigan Delta XL Plus stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer via ThermoFinnigan Confloâ€…III interface ( Teece  et al. , 2011 ). The accuracy and precision of the stable isotope measurements (expressed in the standard per mille notation relative to Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite for Î´ 13 C and atmospheric nitrogen for Î´ 15 N) were verified using National Institute of Standards and Technology RM8573 [Î´ 13 Câ€…=â€…âˆ’26.4â€…Â±â€…0.1â€° ( n â€…=â€…38) and Î´ 15 Nâ€…=â€…âˆ’4.5â€…Â±â€…0.3â€° ( n â€…=â€…38)], RM8574 [Î´ 13 Câ€…=â€…+37.6â€…Â±â€…0.2â€° ( n â€…=â€…38) and Î´ 15 Nâ€…=â€…+47.6â€…Â±â€…0.3â€° ( n â€…=â€…38)]. Daily precision of the instrument was verified by repeated analyses of internal laboratory standards, including acetanilide [Î´ 13 Câ€…=â€…âˆ’29.9â€…Â±â€…0.1â€° and Î´ 15 Nâ€…=â€…âˆ’0.1â€…Â±â€…0.4â€° ( n â€…=â€…9)], valine [Î´ 13 Câ€…=â€…âˆ’10.9â€…Â±â€…0.1â€°, Î´ 15 Nâ€…=â€…âˆ’6.6â€…Â±â€…0.3â€° ( n â€…=â€…5)] and daphnia [Î´ 13 Câ€…=â€…âˆ’24.8â€…Â±â€…0.1â€°, Î´ 15 Nâ€…=â€…+17.2â€…Â±â€…0.5â€° ( n â€…=â€…3)], during the sample runs. We also analysed one composite leaf sample at each plot from a species without the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen (i.e. 27 plants sampled from the oak  Quercus chihuahuensis  Trel.) to be used as reference values for biological atmospheric nitrogen fixation estimates ( Shearer and Kohl, 1986 ). We used the natural  15 N abundance method to estimate the percentage of nitrogen fixation in  D. sonorense  ( Shearer and Kohl, 1986 ), as follows: N 2  fixationâ€…=â€…(Î´ 15 N (reference) â€…âˆ’â€…Î´ 15 N (N-fixing) /Î´ 15 N (reference) â€…âˆ’â€… B )â€…Ã—â€…100, where Î´ 15 N (reference)  is the mean value of the  Q.â€…chihuahuensis , Î´ 15 N (N-fixing)  is the mean value of  D.â€…sonorense  per life stage, and  B  represents the mean value for N 2 -fixing plants when grown totally depending on N 2 . In the absence of  B â€…values for  D.â€…sonorense , we used a common value for tree legumes (âˆ’2â€°) to test the potential importance of extreme  B â€…values ( HÃ¶gberg, 1997 ;  Freitas  et al. , 2010 ). Our calculated variable of biological N 2  fixation was highly (linearly) correlated with  D.â€…sonorense  Î´ 15 N values (Pearson's  r â€…=â€…âˆ’0.87); we therefore focused on interpreting potential trends of biological fixation using  D.â€…sonorense  Î´ 15 N raw values instead of the calculated percentages because these are not always accurate and are thus highly debated (see  Michener and Lajtha, 2007 ). In the present study, low or more negative Î´ 15 N values indicate that higher leaf nitrogen content was potentially derived from atmospheric nitrogen fixation as opposed to, for example, from soil nitrogen ( Shearer and Kohl, 1986 ;  HÃ¶gberg, 1997 ). Likewise, Î´ 13 C raw values were used due their widely known (positive) relationship with long-term water-use efficiency (see  Michener and Lajtha, 2007 ).  In summary, although our sample size was limited by the nature of our rare species, we obtained seven key ecophysiological traits related to carbon assimilation, water-use efficiency and nitrogen fixation in three different life stages occurring at nine different populations (81 sampled plants in total; 27 individuals per stage). The traits included in our analysis are as follows: (in micromoles of carbon dioxide per second per square metre);  E , instantaneous transpiration rate (in millimoles of water per second per square metre);  N , time-integrated leaf nitrogen concentration (expressed as a percentage); PNUE, the instantaneous photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency, the ratio of carbon assimilation rate per unit leaf nitrogen (in micromoles of carbon dioxide per second per mole of nitrogen; WUE, the instantaneous water-use efficiency, the ratio of  A / E  (in micromoles of carbon dioxide per millimole of water); and Î´ 13 C and Î´ 15 N, the time-integrated carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (expressed per mille).

Principal componentâ€…1 (Grad1) and principal componentâ€…2 (Grad2) explained 29 and 24% of the variance, respectively (53% total explained variance). Full names of environmental variables are given in the Materials and methods section.  We compared each of the functional traits among life stages using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's HSD tests. We performed stepwise analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models with each functional trait as a response variable, life stage as a factor and the environmental gradients (Grad1 and Grad2) as covariates. A weighted least-squares model was performed between each response variable and the parameters that minimized the Akaike's Information Criteria score in the stepwise model. We used the relative abundance of each life stage per plot as weights for each of the models to account for life-stage variation. Given that the order of factor levels (i.e. adult, juvenile and seedling life stages) could potentially affect the ANCOVA outcome, we altered the order of life stages (e.g. seedling, juvenile and adult), and similar statistical significance was obtained for adult and seedling parameters. Juvenile stage remained in the middle in both model runs; this makes biological sense because juveniles are an intermediate stage in life history of the species. Response variable transformation was performed (i.e. Log10) to achieve variance homogeneity and normality of model residuals in instantaneous measurements of  A ,  E  and WUE. In all statistical tests, we set the significance level to be Î±â€…=â€…0.05. Finally, a PCA was performed to determine the nature and number of relevant axes of functional resource-use differentiation among life stages.

The position of symbols at the top of the figure indicates mean score values (Â±SEM,  n â€…=â€…27) of each life stage along axisâ€…1. Full names of traits are given in Table  2 .  We present, for the first time, several key time-integrated and  in situ  instantaneous measurements of leaf traits in the rare and endangered cycad,  D. sonorense . Our trait data from nine populations are representative of the different habitats and elevations where  D. sonorense  occurs, and thus our analysis considerably improves our understanding of the main functional strategies in our study species and, potentially, in cycads from arid environments in general.  We initially asked whether the lower resource use in seedlings and juveniles more strongly reflected an adaptation of the younger life stages to different environmental conditions or a developmental constraint preventing them from achieving more advantageous trait values. Our results provide more evidence for the latter because resource use (mainly nitrogen and water) was consistently more efficient in more advanced ontogenetic stages. The long lifespan of  D.â€…sonorense  and other cycads, such as  D.â€…edule , suggests that a higher resource-use efficiency (e.g. nitrogen, water and carbon) in adult plants should be particularly favoured and relevant for their persistence in arid ecosystems given their considerable longevity (e.g. on the scale of hundreds of years in  D.â€…edule ;  Vovides, 1990 ) and the greater importance of adults for future population growth rates ( Raimondo and Donaldson, 2003 ;  Ãlvarez-YÃ©piz  et al. , 2011 ). Our data also suggest that seedlings may possibly be adapted to less extreme environmental conditions (e.g. light, temperature and drought stress levels) compared with juveniles and adults, which produce more resistant leaves with a well-developed waxy coating that reduces water loss (i.e. sclerophyllous leaves). This morphological adaptation seems to develop fully in  D.â€…sonorense  seedlings after âˆ¼60â€…days of germination when their leaves reach maturity ( Ãlvarez-YÃ©piz  et al. , 2014 ; O. Lopez-Bujanda  et al. , unpublished data). Seedlings from another cycad species from dry environments ( D. â€… edule ) showed a higher probability of dehydration during intense drought when their sclerophyllous leaves were not fully developed ( YÃ¡Ã±ez-Espinosa  et al. , 2014 ). These results combined suggest a morpho-physiological threshold above which cycad seedling mortality due to dehydration should be comparatively lower.

Elucidating plant functional responses to different levels of resource availability and environmental factors can provide insights regarding plant strategies to resist multiple stress factors ( Chapin  et al. , 1993 ;  Grime, 2001 ). Two main physiological stressors of plant species in arid environments are related to the availability of water and soil nutrients ( Chapin  et al. , 1987 ;  Condit  et al. , 2013 ). Our soil data suggest that finer-textured soils prevail at lower elevations (and at gentler slopes) as opposed to coarser-textured soils at higher elevations (and at steeper slopes). Consistent with our data, fine-textured soils contain higher organic matter, nitrogen, water-holding capacity and availability of ions such as potassium, sodium, magnesium or calcium ( Brady and Weil, 2007 ). Deficiency of any of these ions could have detrimental effects in plants because they are essential for key cell osmotic functions. For example, several studies have shown that potassium deficiency may affect the ability of plants to survive short- and long-term periods of water stress ( Cakmak, 2005 ;  Egilla  et al. , 2005 ). Abundance of  D.â€…sonorense  adult plants has been related to soil potassium content and slope steepness ( Ãlvarez-YÃ©piz  et al. , 2011 ). Therefore, our environmental and leaf trait data suggest that plant functional responses to water stress can be highly sensitive to topographical location, which affects soil fertility and moisture levels, as inferred with Î´ 13 C values.  Acquisition of resources, such carbon and water, seems generally to be positively related to soil fertility, whereas the opposite pattern should be expected for biological nitrogen fixation ( Aerts and Chapin, 1999 ;  Zahran, 1999 ;  Bai  et al. , 2009 ;  OrdoÃ±ez  et al. , 2009 ). In our study, nitrogen- and water-use efficiency (i.e. PNUE and Î´ 13 C values positively correlated with long-term WUE) increased at lower elevations with more fertile soils, whereas reliance on biological nitrogen fixation (inferred from Î´ 15 N values) increased at higher elevations with less fertile soils. In contrast to humid regions, drought stress in our study system can systematically increase leaf Î´ 13 C values because of higher temperatures and potential water loss at lower elevations where drought-deciduous species predominate ( Brodribb and Hill, 1998 ;  Van de Water  et al. , 2002 ;  Adams and Kolb, 2004 ;  Ãlvarez-YÃ©piz  et al. , 2008 ). Furthermore, we found average leaf Î´ 13 C cycad values close to 25â€° at lower elevations, which are typical of plants under water stress ( Chapin  et al. , 2002 ). In long-lived gymnosperms from arid environments, such as many cycads, water-use efficiency should probably increase in the drought-stressed environments and atmospheric nitrogen fixation in the nutrient-stressed environments. Failure to maintain this functional trade-off, for example at low/high elevations, may shrink our study species range; particularly, the lower and upper altitudinal limits in response to rapid land-use or climate change (see  Easterling  et al. , 2000 ;  Davies and Shaw, 2001 ;  Walther  et al. , 2002 ).  In this study, we quantified ecophysiological traits related to carbon and nitrogen acquisition and water-use efficiency across the ontogeny of a rare evergreen long-lived cycad species and in relationship to environmental gradients. Our trait data suggest that increased water-use efficiency at drier low elevations and nitrogen fixation at upper elevations with nutrient-poor soils may represent important functional strategies for maintaining the lower and upper altitudinal species range limits, especially in semi-arid environments during increasingly stressful conditions due to the ongoing climatic and land-use changes. Currently, the two most popular explanations for the distribution of gymnosperms (including cycad species) in contemporary environments are the contraction to refuge habitats due to past climatic changes and the poor competition with angiosperm species due to reproductive and physiological constraints ( Bond, 1989 ;  Becker, 2000 ;  Preece  et al. , 2007 ;  Ãlvarez-YÃ©piz  et al. , 2011 , 2014). In addition, we argue that facilitation linked to the regeneration niche and enhanced resource-use efficiency linked to the adult niche may strongly influence present and future cycad distribution and persistence, particularly in stressful arid environments. Demographic models usually suggest that adults contribute the most to future population growth rates in long-lived plant species, and thus conservation actions are mainly recommended at the adult stage (see  Ãlvarez-YÃ©piz  et al. , 2011 ). However, adult recruitment will be possible if seedlings survive drought, nutrient limitation and other environmental stresses. We therefore recommend the inclusion of a functional perspective into conservation actions targeting rare or endangered plant species to identify, first, the most sensitive stages to changing environmental conditions and, second, potential species range shifts and adaptive responses to global land-use and climate change.
