Diet and feeding behaviour of the leaf-litter frog Ischnocnema henselii (Anura: Brachycephalidae) in Araucaria rain forests on the Serra Geral of Rio Grande do Sul, BrazilAbstract We analysed the diet of Ischnocnema henselii from a subtropical Araucaria forest through stomach flushing. The identified prey items comprised arthropods such as spiders, ants, orthopterans, collembolans and homopterans. We consider I. henselii to be a nocturnal and opportunistic sit-and-wait predator. Small animals are preferred. Because this species lives permanently on the forest floor, we also determined the composition of the habitat's leaf-litter mesofauna. By using Winkler sieve extraction, we obtained a spectrum of small invertebrates that reflected the prey in the stomach contents well. The only exceptions were mites, the most abundant leaf-litter inhabitants, which frogs either avoided or ignored. Our results represent the first information on the diet of I. henselii and are discussed in comparison with data on related species and in relation to the relevance of this predator within the food web of subtropical montane rain forests in southern Brazil.
