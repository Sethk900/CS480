Organic and inorganic carbon in soils of semiarid regions: a case study from the Guadix–Baza basin (Southeast Spain)Intramontane sedimentary basins are an important landscape component for the evaluation of soil carbon stored in semiarid regions with Mediterranean climate. We determined the soil organic and inorganic carbon (SOC and SIC) stored at various depths in 81 profiles sampled specifically in one such basin (3317 km2) located in Southeast Spain. Sampling reached down to 2.0–4.0 m and the samples were analysed by conventional methods. The mean SOC content for a 2.0-m depth column was 7.8 kg m−2, and the mean SIC content (calcite plus dolomite) was 134.4 kg m−2, 23% of total SOC contents and 51% of total SIC contents in the 2.0-m column were found in the second meter. The figures for SIC are considerably higher than those reported in other evaluations for semiarid regions.
