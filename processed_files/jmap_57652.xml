High-Temperature Microwave NaOH Pretreatment of Waste-Activated Sludge for Anaerobic DigestionAbstractThe research reported in this paper determined the effect of combined microwave irradiation and NaOH pretreatment on solubilization and biodegradation in anaerobic digestion of waste-activated sludge (WAS). Solubilization increased significantly with NaOH concentration (20–60  meqNaOH/L) and microwave final temperature (100–170°C). However, the experimental trials did not adequately approximate the response surface for volatile solids reduction, cumulative biogas production, and biogas yield. Within the design boundaries, the maximum solubilization degree (72%) of WAS occurred at 60  meq/L and 170°C. The highest volatile solids removal efficiency (62.4%) was achieved at 40  meq/L and 170°C. Cumulative biogas production and yield were 2.3–5.7  L/L and 154–393  mL/g added volatile solids, respectively, and both parameters were highest at 20  meq/L and 135°C.
