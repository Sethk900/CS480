Functional evenness is increasingly considered an important facet of functional diversity that sheds light on the complex relationships between community assembly and ecosystem functioning. Nonetheless, in spite of its relevant role for ecosystem functioning, only a few measures of functional evenness have been proposed. In this paper we introduce a new measure of functional evenness that reflects the regularity in the distribution of species abundances, together with the evenness in their pairwise functional dissimilarities. To show how the proposed measure works, we focus on changes in functional evenness calculated from Grime’s classification of plant strategies as competitors (C), stress-tolerators (S) and ruderals (R) along a post-fire successional gradient in temperate chestnut forests of southern Switzerland.  To ease the visualization of post-fire successional dynamics the plots are grouped into early- (&lt; 10 years after fire), and late-successional stages (≥ 10 years after fire).  R 2   =  0.306; p&lt;0.05 (two-tailed test, 9999 randomizations).  To conclude, changes in functional evenness may be induced by changes in interspecies dissimilarities and/or in species abundances, as both of them contribute in shaping community functioning. Accordingly, a ‘perfect’ measure of functional evenness probably does not exist. Rather, several ‘tailored’ measures of functional evenness may be developed that result from how abundances and dissimilarities are weighted in the calculation of the index, and their specific relevance must be judged on the basis of their ability to fit the given problem of application.
