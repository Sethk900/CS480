A new species of the genus Disogmus Förster (Hymenoptera, Proctotrupoidea, Proctotrupidae) from the Eocene Rovno amberAbstract Disogmus rasnitsyni Kolyada & Perkovsky, sp. n. is described from a fossil inclusion of Late Eocene amber (Ukraine). The new species is most similar to Disogmus basalis (Thomson, 1857), in particular, in the shape of the tyloids and the general shortening of the segments of antennae, but distinctly differs from it and the other species of the genus by having tyloids on flagellar segments 2–4 compared to 3–6 and 4–7 in other species.
