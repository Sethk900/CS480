Using the KINEROS2 Modeling Framework to Evaluate the Increase in Storm Runoff from Residential Development in a Semiarid EnvironmentAbstractThe increase in runoff from urbanization is well known; one extreme example comes from a 13-ha residential neighborhood in southeast Arizona where runoff was 26 times greater than in an adjacent grassland watershed over a 40-month period from 2005 to 2008. Rainfall-runoff modeling using the newly described KINEROS2 urban element, which simulates a contiguous row of houses and the adjoining street as a series of pervious and impervious overland flow planes, combined with tension infiltrometer measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), indicate that 17±14% of this increase in runoff is due to a 53% decrease in Ks in constructed pervious areas as compared to the undeveloped grassland. Ks in the urban watershed identified from calibrating the rainfall-runoff model to measured runoff is higher than measured Ks but much lower than indicated by a soil texture–based KINEROS2 parameter look-up table. Tests using different levels of discretization found that watershed geometry could be represented in a simplified manner, although more detailed discretization led to better model performance.
