ANPP ESTIMATES FROM NDVI FOR THE CENTRAL GRASSLAND REGION OF THE UNITED STATESSeveral studies have suggested the existence of a positive relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from AVHRR/NOAA satellite data and either biomass or annual aboveground net primary production (ANPP) for different geographic areas and ecosystems. We calibrated a 4-yr average of the ingegral of the NDVI (NDVI-I) using spatially aggregated values of ANPP. We also provided an estimate of the energy conversion efficiency coefficient (ε) of Monteith’s equation. This is the first attempt to calibrate a standard NDVI product for temperate perennial grasslands.
