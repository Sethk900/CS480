An appraisal of the problems in classifying saline-sodic soils of the indo-gangetic plain in NW IndiaMost of the salt-affected soils of the Indo-Gangetic plain in NW India do not find suitable places in the 1970 U.S. system of soil classification. According to the current class definitions, soils with high salts, ESP, pH, chromas and yellower hues key out as Typic or Aquic Calciorthids, Camborthids and Haplustalfs which does not spell out their saline-sodic nature. For land-use recommendations, the authors believe it will be useful to set these soils apart at some high categoric level in the system. It is proposed that the structural requirements for the natric horizon be modified to include horizons with high ESP (â©¾ 40) but having simple blocky structure with or without tongues of eluvial material. New subgroups, viz. Natric, within the orders of Inceptisols, Alfisols and Aridisols is suggested for the high sodium-saturated soils lacking natric horizons. For similar practical considerations, the high concentrations of salts in soils when associated with high ESP pose problems in leaching and consequently new subgroups, viz. Salic and Salic Natric, within the orders of Aridisols and Alfisols are suggested. The modifications proposed not only place more emphasis on the saline-sodic nature of these soils but also result in better groupings for practical land use.
