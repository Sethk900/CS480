Widespread overharvesting of top consumers of the worldâ€™s ecosystems has â€œskewedâ€ food webs, in terms of biomass and species richness, towards a generally greater domination at lower trophic levels. This skewing is exacerbated in locations where exotic species are predominantly low-trophic level consumers such as benthic macrophytes, detritivores, and filter feeders. However, in some systems where numerous exotic predators have been added, sometimes purposefully as in many freshwater systems, food webs are skewed in the opposite direction toward consumer dominance. Little is known about how such modifications to food web topology, e.g., changes in the ratio of predator to prey species richness, affect ecosystem functioning. We experimentally measured the effects of trophic skew on production in an estuarine food web by manipulating ratios of species richness across three trophic levels in experimental mesocosms. After 24 days, increasing macroalgal richness promoted both plant biomass and grazer abundance, although the positive effect on plant biomass disappeared in the presence of grazers. The strongest trophic cascade on the experimentally stocked macroalgae emerged in communities with a greater ratio of prey to predator richness (bottom-rich food webs), while stronger cascades on the accumulation of naturally colonizing algae (primarily microalgae with some early successional macroalgae that recruited and grew in the mesocosms) generally emerged in communities with greater predator to prey richness (the more top-rich food webs). These results suggest that trophic skewing of species richness and overall changes in food web topology can influence marine community structure and food web dynamics in complex ways, emphasizing the need for multitrophic approaches to understand the consequences of marine extinctions and invasions.  The degree of trophic skewing encompassed the presence of upper trophic levels (i.e., food chain length: algae only,+grazers,+grazers+predators) and the distribution of species richness (top-rich, neutral, slightly bottom-rich, bottom-rich skewed) on final A) macroalgal biomass, B) microalgal accumulation, and C) grazer abundance. Only data from replicates in which grazers were initially stocked (all treatments except â€˜algae onlyâ€™) were used in the analysis of food chain length and richness distribution treatment effects on grazer abundance (C).  Final grazer abundance per species across trophic skew treatments in the presence and absence of predators. Values are meansÂ±1SE.  Plot of the nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) scores for the two most important axes for all replicates using final grazer species composition data. Circles and stars represent the absence and presence of predators, respectively. Trophic skew treatments are represented from light to dark as follows: top-rich, neutral, slightly bottom-rich, and bottom-rich.  (TIF)  (TIF)  (TIF)
