Desertification processes due to heavy grazing in sandy rangeland, Inner MongoliaWe conducted a grazing experiment from 1992 to 1996 in Inner Mongolia to explore desertification processes of sandy rangeland. The results show that continuous heavy grazing results in a considerable decrease in vegetation cover, height, standing biomass and root biomass, and a significant increase in animal hoof impacts. As a result, small bare spots appeared on the ground and later merged into larger bare areas in the rangeland. Total bare area reached up to 52% and the average depth of wind erosion was 25 cm in the fifth year of the study. We conclude that sandy rangeland with wind-erodible soil is susceptible to desertification. Heavy grazing of such rangeland should be avoided. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
