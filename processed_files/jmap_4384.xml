Effect of soil fertility management strategies and resource-endowment on spatial soil fertility gradients, plant nutrient uptake and maize growth at two smallholder areas, north-western ZimbabweAbstract We investigate the effects of smallholder farmer resource—endowment and soil nutrient management strategies on plant nutrient uptake and growth across soil fertility gradients under semi-arid conditions. Soil fertility gradients as influenced by farmers’ resource availability may affect the response of crops to fertilizer addition and therefore productivity. The study was conducted in Njelele and Nemangwe smallholder areas (450-800 mm per annum, unimodal) in north-western Zimbabwe. Soil and maize cobleaf samples were collected from fields of farmers (varying resource endowment) located near to (homefields) and far away (outfields) from the farmers’ homesteads during the 2005–6 season. The samples were analysed for selected soil fertility indicators and soil samples were further used to test maize growth response to various nutrient applications under greenhouse conditions. Soil fertility (organic C, total N and available P) significantly (P<0.05) decreased from resource-endowed to resource-constrained farmers, and from outfields to homefields, but the latter differences were only significant for available P. Besides resource-endowment and field type, response to nutrient applications also depended on soil texture. In sandy soil, both N and P were limiting to MAIZE growth in outfields while N was most limiting in the homefield. It was concluded that resource-endowment and nutrient resource management strategies employed by farmers result in soil fertility gradients which affect response of crops to fertilisation and therefore need to be factored in the development of fertiliser recommendations.
