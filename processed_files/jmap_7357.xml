IdentificatiÃ³n y MorfologÃ­a de Larvas, Juveniles y Adultos de Mylossoma paraguayensis Norman, 1929. (Pisces, Characidae).Abstract Identification and morphology of larvae, juveniles and adults of Mylossoma paraguayensis Norman, 1929 (Pisces, Characidae) This study is a contribution to the knowledge of development and identification of larvae, juveniles and adults of the â€œpacucitoâ€; Mylossoma paraguayensis. This species recorded from Paraguay, middle and lower ParanÃ¡ rivers is not frequent in the Santa Fe area. We used 36 specimens (5.1 â€ 79 mm standard length) collected from different bodies of water near Santa Fe city (31Â°40'S, 60Â°35'W). Variations of morphological and meristic characters, as well as the evolution of pigmentation pattern, skull bones, jaws and teeth, girdle and fins and caudal skeleton, through the above mentioned lengths, were analyzed. Based on this study changes from larval to juvenile stages (between 23 and 25 mm) and juvenile to adult ones (between 30 and 35 mm standard length) were determined. Drawings of specimens at different sizes, jaws and teeth, caudal skeleton, allometry graphic using regression data and meristic counts are included.
