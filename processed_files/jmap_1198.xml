Soil Algae in Brown Coal and Lignite Post-Mining Areas in Central Europe (Czech Republic and Germany).Algal communities were investigated in two contrasting chronosequences established on reclaimed spoils in the west Bohemian brown coal mining district near Sokolov (Czech Republic) and in the Lusatian lignite mining district near Cottbus (Germany). The Sokolov chronosequence was characterized by tertiary cypric clay substrate, afforestation with <em>Alnus glutinosa</em> (L.) Gaertn., and high pH of deposited spoil material, Cottbus chronosequence by tertiary carboniferous and pyritic sand of extremely low pH ameliorated by fly ash, and afforestation with <em>Pinus sylvestris</em> L. and <em>P. nigra</em> Arnold. A total of 122 species of algae was found in both areas. Although the same species number (80) was identified from Sokolov and Cottbus, both proportion of individual algal groups and species composition were different. Green algae prevailed in both areas, but in Sokolov cyanobacteria and diatoms were also quite diverse, and in younger sites they were also abundant. Total abundance of algae ranged mostly between 10<sup>4</sup>–10<sup>7</sup> cells/g dry soil, and was one order higher in Cottbus than in Sokolov. Species number was high in young sites, decreased with increasing age, and was the lowest in control forests. In Sokolov, the highest abundance was recorded in the youngest alder plantation. In Cottbus, sludge and compost fertilization used in the youngest pine plantations resulted in rapid formation of visible algal crusts dominated by <em>Klebsormidium crenulatum</em> (Kütz) Lokhorst.
