Examining functional components of cover: the relationship between concealment and visibility in shrub-steppe habitatThe term â€œcoverâ€ has been used broadly in ecology, with a wide range of meanings, from thermal cover to security cover, to escape cover. Some habitat features could provide both thermal and security cover, or both concealment and escape cover; but in other cases, habitat features such as vegetation could impose a tradeoff between opposing functions of cover. Cover that conceals an animal from a predator also could reduce the animal's visibility and thus, its ability to detect a predator early enough to escape capture. We quantified the opposing functional properties of cover (concealment and visibility) and evaluated the relationship between these properties using continuous measures in sagebrush-steppe and grassland habitats. We hypothesized that concealment and visibility would be inversely related and that the slope of this relationship would differ among sites with varying density and patchiness of shrub vegetation, imposing differing tradeoff scenarios. Concealment and visibility were inversely, but not perfectly related, implying that animals must make tradeoffs between the properties of cover, but they could achieve higher levels of one property while giving up relatively less of the other. In addition, we examined potential tradeoffs by pygmy rabbits (Brachylagus idahoensis) by comparing concealment and visibility at locations used by rabbits with measurements collected at random locations. At a small scale, pygmy rabbits traded off visibility for concealment in dense and sparse vegetation, but not in patchy vegetation. Although cover is an intuitively simple concept, it is functionally more complex, and this study provides insight into the opposing mechanisms of cover that might influence habitat use. Our work provides an initial step towards more fully understanding how cover functionally relates to predation risk.
