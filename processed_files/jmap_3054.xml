Nocturnal drinking by mourning doves (Zenaida macroura)In February 2000, we recorded mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) congregating at and drinking from a guzzler during nocturnal hours in the Chihuahuan Desert. Mourning doves might use nocturnal hours to maintain water balance in desert environments.
