Insect herbivores foraging on seedlings in an unlogged rain forest in Guyana: spatial and temporal considerationsAbout 9,000 individuals of sap-sucking and leaf-chewing insects, representing 345 species, were collected from 10,000 seedlings belonging to 5 rainforest tree species in an unlogged forest in Guyana. For the 40 most common species, it was possible to estimate their host specificity, diurnal activity, seasonal distribution, spatial aggregation, abundance and body weight. Most species were generalists but more specialised species tended to show a higher spatial aggregation, a more restricted diurnal activity and a higher seasonality. Although insect abundance was highest at the onset of the long wet season in May, seasonal amplitude was not pronounced. The combined effects of host and rainfall explained 14.5% of the total variance in insect seasonality, which was poorly explained by the leaf production of seedlings. The spatial distribution of insects was often aggregated and, overall, explained by host effect, production of young foliage, number of conspecific trees within a radius of 50m, and number of dead seedlings at each collecting station. However, these variables explained only 7% of the variance in spatial distribution. The lack of notable influence of leaf production and other important variables recorded at the collecting stations suggests that the seedlings represent a marginal food resource for most of the insect species collected.
