Restoring the Vegetation of Mined Peatlands in the Southern Rocky Mountains of Colorado, U.S.A.South Park is a high-elevation, semi-arid, treeless in- termountain basin in central Colorado. A few extreme rich fens occur on the western margin and in the cen- ter of South Park where regional and local groundwa- ter flow systems discharge to the ground surface. Over the past 40 years there has been extensive peat mining in these fens, but restoration methods have yet to be developed and successfully applied. The first part of this study compared the naturally reestablished vege- tation on six mined peatlands with six pristine sites, while the second part of the study tested different revegetation techniques in 27 plots with varying depths to the water table. The six mined sites had only 30 plant species as compared with 122 species in the un- mined sites; 43% of the species in the mined sites were not present in the undisturbed fens. Even after 40 years the sedges and willows that dominate the un- disturbed sites were largely absent on the mined sites. The revegetation experiments seeded eight species, transplanted Carex aquatilis (water sedge) seedlings, transplanted rhizomes from six species, and trans- planted four species of willow cuttings. Of the eight species seeded, only Triglochin maritima (arrowgrass) germinated and established seedlings. C. aquatilis seedlings, rhizome transplants of C. aquatilis, Kobresia simpliciuscula (elk sedge), and Juncus arcticus (arc- tic rush), and willow cuttings all had differing pat- terns of survival with respect to the annual maximum height of the water table. These results indicate that the dominant species can be successfully reintro- duced to mined surfaces with the appropriate hydro- logic conditions, but human intervention will be nec- essary to rapidly re-establish these species. The slow rate of peat accumulation means that restoration of the mined fens will require hundreds, if not thou- sands, of years.
