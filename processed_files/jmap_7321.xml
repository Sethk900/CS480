Systematic status of the large squirrels (subgenus urosciurus) of the western Amazon basinPatterns of geographic variation within and between regional samples of the large rufous western Amazon squirrels (Sciurus) are described based on univariate and multivariate analyses. Two species are clearly recognizable by independent patterns of geographic variation in measured characters, non‚Äoverlapping qualitative cranial features, and certain pelage color characteristics. These species are a long‚Ämuzzled, narrow‚Äskulled 5. spadiceus Olfers and a more normal‚Ämuzzled, broader‚Äskulled S. igniventris Wagner. The two are sympatric over all of eastern Ecuador and most of Per√∫; only spadiceus is known from Bolivia.
