Three new species of the brackishâ€water copepod Halicyclops (Crustacea, Cyclopoida) from Ariake Bay, JapanThree new species of the cyclopoid copepod Halicyclops are described from river estuaries of Ariake Bay, Japan. Halicyclops continentalis sp. nov. is most similar to H. laminifer, but differs by the shape of an angular protuberance on the genital doubleâ€somite and a serrate hyaline frill of the fourth urosomite. Halicyclops sinensis described by Tai and Chen is widely distributed in China and is identifiable to H. continentalis, indicating that the population in Ariake Bay is probably a continental relict. Halicyclops uncus sp. nov., belonging to the thermophilus group, is distinguishable by the shape of the lateral process on the genital doubleâ€somite, a frill of the fourth urosomite and caudal rami; it is probably endemic to Japan. Halicyclops ariakensis sp. nov. differs from the other congeners by a combination of the shape of the prosome, urosomal hyaline frills and caudal ramus length; it is considered endemic to Ariake Bay.
