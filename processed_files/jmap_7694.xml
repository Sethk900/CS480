Beitrag zur faunistik, √ñkologie und biologie der Odonaten von s√ºdchileSummary During the summer 1963/64, numerous excursions were made to two ponds at the Isla Teja (Valdivia, Southern Chile) and the Odonate fauna was studied. 9 of the 38 species known from Chile (Fraser 1957) were found in their immediate vicinity. Two further species from other biotopes in the environment of Valdivia are also mentioned. They are described and biological data concerning season of flight, abundance, ovi‚Äposition etc, are given for most of the species, especially for Acanthagrion interruptum Selys (Zygoptera, Coenagrionidae).
