Accuracy in predicting moisture deficits and changes in yield from soil mapsIn a survey area of 1435 ha, water-tables have been lowered as a result of water extraction for drinking water supplies. We simulated the change in grass yield in this area by comparing the former and present hydrological situations. A soil map on a scale of 1:10,000 of the area was used to derive soil maps on scales of 1:25,000 and 1:50,000. Representative profile descriptions from the mapping units of the three soil maps were physically interpreted and were used thereafter as a basis for simulating changes in yield. We wanted to know whether the quality of representative profile descriptions would permit correct predictions for the whole area and for specific locations within the area. Therefore, we compared the simulated values of the representative profile descriptions with simulated values of individual borings. Two attributes were investigated: the simulated change in yield due to extraction of water and the simulated average moisture deficit in a 30-year period under the present hydrological situation (after water extraction). For the whole area, the mean error was used as a quality measure. No differences in quality were found among representative profile descriptions for the three map scales. As quality measures for point predictions, the mean absolute error and the mean square error were used. The calculated errors are quite large. For instance, the error in the estimation of the moisture deficit is 50% or more for all three map scales. Spatial variability within a mapping unit forms a large proportion of this error. The best predictions at point locations were obtained with the representative profile descriptions for the 1:10,000 map.
