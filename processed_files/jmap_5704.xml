Ptyctimous mites (Acari, Oribatida) from the Ecuador rainforestTwelve species of ptyctimous mite have been found in new localities in forest litter, in two National Parks of Ecuador: Bombuscaro and Cajanuma. The ptyctimous mite fauna has been shown to differ totally between the two parks. Two new species are described: Euphthiracarus bombuscaroensis sp. nov. and Austrophthiracarus cajanumaensis sp. nov. Three species are reported from Ecuador for the first time. The specimens of two species: Protophthiracarus quasiminisetosus Niedbała and Illig, 2006 and Notophthiracarus aculeatus Niedbała, 1988 found in Ecuador have some morphological characters different from their analogues in the type specimens.
