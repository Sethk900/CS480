We examined competition effects in an experiment with three  Impatiens  species (Balsaminaceae) sharing similar life-history characteristics and habitats: the native  I. noli-tangere , and two invasive species,  I. parviflora  and  I. glandulifera . The results suggest that the effect of competition on the performance of invasive  Impatiens  species exceeds that of environmental factors, i.e. light and soil moisture. Competitive interactions with co-occurring congeners may thus be a more important predictor of the invasion success of an invasive species and its population dynamics than its response to abiotic factors, and should be taken into account when evaluating their invasion potential.  Many invasive species are considered competitively superior to native species, with the strongest competition expected in species with similar niches and/or in closely related species. However, competition outcome is strongly context-dependent as competitive strength varies along environmental gradients, and life stages, and also depends on abundances. To explore the importance of these factors, we examined competition effects in an experiment with three  Impatiens  species (Balsaminaceae) widespread in central Europe and sharing similar life-history characteristics and habitats: the native  I. noli-tangere , and two invasive species,  I. parviflora  and  I. glandulifera . We compared their competitive strength and reciprocal impacts under two levels of water and light availability, two overall planting densities and three competitor densities. We assessed species performance (ability to complete the life-cycle, biomass and fecundity) and temporal competition dynamics in a garden pot experiment. Environmental variables had lower explanatory power than overall planting and competitor density, which indicates the importance of competitive interactions when evaluating plant performance and potential invasion success. Despite poor and delayed germination, the invasive  I. glandulifera  attained dominance even at a high competitor density and was competitively superior across all treatments, exceeding the height of both congeners.  Impatiens parviflora  was competitively weakest, having a negligible impact on both native  I. noli-tangere  and invasive  I. glandulifera . The intermediate competitive strength of the native  I. noli-tangere  probably results from its intermediate height, and good germination rate and timing. The difference in height among species increased during the experiment when  I. glandulifera  was involved; this species continues growing until autumn, enhancing its competitive superiority. The results provide a mechanistic understanding for the competitive exclusion of native  I. noli-tangere  that occurs in stands with  I. glandulifera , but the limited impact of  I. parviflora  on  I. noli-tangere  in their mixed stands.  Non-native species have to overcome numerous barriers to naturalize and become invasive in the introduced range ( Richardson  et al . 2000 ;  Blackburn  et al . 2011 ). While immediately after introduction into a new range the species need to cope with the local environment, especially climatic conditions ( Wiens and Graham 2005 ), later on different mechanisms involving interactions, or their absence, with resident biota come into play. It has been suggested that some invading species can exploit resources not used by plants in resident communities (empty niche hypothesis;  Elton 1958 ;  Lambdon  et al . 2008 ), which results in minimizing or even avoiding competitive interactions with co-occurring species ( MacArthur 1972 ;  Crawley 1987 ;  MacDougall  et al . 2009 ). On the other hand, the outcome of interactions with resident organisms, especially competition ( Levine  et al . 2004 ), have been repeatedly found to be important for successful invasion of local communities ( Sakai  et al . 2001 ;  Levine  et al . 2004 ;  VilÃ  and Weiner 2004 ;  Maherali and Klironomos 2007 ;  Hierro  et al.  2011 ). In particular case studies, competitive advantage of invading species is often attributed to traits such as high germination rate, good survival, fast growth, early or late flowering, high fecundity and tall stature ( Baker 1965 ;  PyÅ¡ek and Richardson 2007 ;  KubeÅ¡ovÃ¡  et al . 2010 ;  MoravcovÃ¡  et al . 2010 ;  van Kleunen  et al . 2010 ;  Pellock  et al . 2013 ).  Nevertheless, alien invaders were not found to be significantly competitively superior to native species in an analysis of available case studies ( Daehler 2003 ). The outcome of competition depended on the environmental context ( Daehler 2003 ), e.g. on water availability ( Franzese and Ghermandi 2014 ), shading ( Molina-Montenegro  et al . 2012 ) or nutrient supply ( Powell and Knight 2009 ). The competitive hierarchy of alien and native species changes along environmental gradients ( Milberg  et al . 1999 ;  Shea and Chesson 2002 ;  Pathikonda  et al . 2009 ), with competitive strength of invaders usually decreasing towards more extreme conditions, such as, for example, high altitudes ( Daehler 2005 ;  Alexander  et al . 2011 ;  PyÅ¡ek  et al . 2011 ). However, many invasive species possess a high phenotypic plasticity which makes them capable of adapting to a wide range of environmental conditions ( Funk 2008 ;  Berg and Ellers 2010 ). This corresponds to invasive plants often being generalists with a broad tolerance of ecological conditions, but exploiting resources less effectively than specialists ( Richards  et al . 2006 ).  The strength of competition between species depends on the degree to which their niches overlap ( Hutchinson 1957 ), with two species occupying the same niche unable to co-exist over the long term ( Hardin 1960 ). The strongest competition is expected in closely related species ( Darwin 1859 ;  Elton 1946 ;  Maherali and Klironomos 2007 ;  Violle  et al . 2011 ). Nevertheless, some studies have found no linkage between the relatedness of competing species and the competition strength ( Cahill  et al . 2008 ) or reported even an opposite pattern, with less intense competition between closely related species ( Diez  et al . 2008 ;  Mayfield and Levine 2010 ). Strong competition was suggested as the reason why invasive species from families with numerous members in native floras are under-represented in floras of target regions ( RejmÃ¡nek 1996 ;  Daehler 2001 ).  Despite some studies testing for the competitive superiority of invasive plants over native plants under a range of environmental conditions ( Powell and Knight 2009 ;  Molina-Montenegro  et al . 2012 ;  Franzese and Ghermandi 2014 ), the competitive relationships between these two groups of species have rarely been tested along the gradient of competitor densities (but see  Leger and Espeland 2010 ). Moreover, studies focusing on a reciprocal impact of native species on invasive species are still the exception rather than the rule ( Leger and Espeland 2010 ;  Carvallo  et al . 2013 ).  The rationale of our study stems from the well-established notion that high-density results in severe competition for resources ( Antonovics and Levin 1980 ;  Silvertown and Charlesworth 2009 ). Invasive species often gain an advantage over their native competitors under high resource supply, but stressful conditions can reverse the hierarchy, leading to a competitive advantage of natives ( Daehler 2003 ). Density-dependent effects may differ across life stages, with the strongest effect found in the emergence stage ( Goldberg  et al.  2001 ). For intraspecific competition, high plant density usually decreases biomass and the number of individuals ( Antonovics and Levin 1980 ). On the other hand, density effects have rarely been found to be significant in interspecific competition ( Connolly  et al . 1990 , but see  Antonovics and Fowler 1985 ).  To obtain a deeper insight into competitive interactions between native and invasive species under manipulated environmental conditions, varying plant densities and different life stages, we used three annual  Impatiens  species occurring in Central Europe: native  I. noli-tangere  and invasive  I. glandulifera  and  I. parviflora . Using congeners minimizes phylogenetic biases ( Burns 2004 ;  Grotkopp and RejmÃ¡nek 2007 ;  van Kleunen  et al . 2010 ) as well as those associated with other traits such as life history or dispersal mode. Due to the overlap of the species' niches, which brings them into direct contact in the field ( ÄŒuda  et al . 2014 ), we expected strong interspecific competition to occur ( Matesanz  et al.  2011 ). It is of interest to understand the ecological interactions among the  Impatiens  species because highly invasive  I. glandulifera , which has historically colonized river banks, is currently spreading into novel habits such as clearings and roadsides distant from the river courses ( Hejda and PyÅ¡ek 2006 ;  ÄŒuda  et al . 2014 ). Since environmental conditions and dispersal vectors in these novel habitats differ from those acting in river corridors, the competitive interactions among this invader and co-occurring species might be changing. It is thus necessary to establish the competitive hierarchies of the three species across a range of seed availability and environmental conditions. A previous study ( ÄŒuda  et al . 2014 ) revealed that shade, and moisture drive  Impatiens  distributions in the field. As such, we assessed these factors in a common garden experiment designed to capture the reciprocal effects of competition between species. Specifically, we answer the following questions. (i) What is the effect of density-dependent congeneric competition and environmental conditions on the ability of plants to complete their life-cycle? (ii) How do these factors affect plant biomass and fecundity? (iii) How does the effect of competition change over time with respect to the life stages?  All three studied  Impatiens  (Balsaminaceae) species are annuals with similar biological characteristics ( Coombe 1956 ;  Beerling and Perrins 1993 ;  Hatcher 2003 ) and habitat preferences ( SlavÃ­k 1997 ), but with different origin and invasion status in the Czech Republic ( PyÅ¡ek  et al . 2012 a  ). They partly differ in germination rates and stratification demands ( PerglovÃ¡  et al . 2009 ), but in the field the majority of seedlings emerge within one month (April) (J. ÄŒuda, pers. obs). The presence of all three species is dependent on disturbances and they therefore often occur in early successional herbaceous communities. At the same locality, the spatial pattern of the occurrence of individual  Impatiens  species is driven by canopy closure and water availability ( ÄŒuda  et al . 2014 ).   Impatiens noli-tangere  L., a native species, grows in damp forests, at clearings, along watercourses and around springs ( SlavÃ­k 1997 ). It is recorded from 39 habitat types in the Czech Republic ( SÃ¡dlo  et al . 2007 ). Its height varies depending on local conditions from 20 to 120 cm ( Hatcher 2003 ). The plants flower from July to August and set seed from mid-July to end of August. It is reported that it may be suppressed by competition from invasive  I. parviflora , with which it often co-occurs ( TichÃ½ 1997 ;  FaliÅ„ski 1998 ;  Chmura and Sierka 2007 ) as well as by competition from  I. glandulifera  ( Vervoort  et al . 2011 ;  ÄŒuda  et al . 2014 ).   Impatiens parviflora  DC., an invasive species, is characterized by a height similar to that of  I. noli-tangere  ( Coombe 1956 ) and a broad ecological amplitude, being recorded from 45 habitat types in the Czech Republic ( SÃ¡dlo  et al . 2007 ;  PyÅ¡ek  et al . 2012 b  ). It often grows as a dominant in nitrophilous herbaceous vegetation at shady mesic sites, in alluvial forests, oak-hornbeam forests, ravine forests and spruce or  Robinia pseudoacacia  plantations ( PyÅ¡ek  et al . 2012 b  ). The plants flower from mid-June to October, setting seed from late June until the first autumn frosts.   Impatiens glandulifera  Royle, a highly invasive species, occurs predominantly along rivers, but has been recently colonizing forest clearings and margins, wet ditches, forest roads and ruderal sites. It is recorded from 16 habitat types ( SÃ¡dlo  et al . 2007 ;  PyÅ¡ek  et al . 2012 b  ;  Pahl  et al . 2013 ) but the number is expected to increase due to the ongoing spread. The plants flower from late July until the first frosts, setting seeds from late August. Due to high seed production ( MoravcovÃ¡  et al . 2010 ) and tall stature up to 3 m ( Adamowski 2008 ), it is highly competitive and able to replace the native flora in invaded sites.  Seeds were collected from large established populations, extending over 2500 m 2  in July and August 2011. Seeds of  I. glandulifera  were collected in Bohuslavice nad MetujÃ­ (50Â°18â€²4.315â€³N, 16Â°5â€²22.730â€³E) along a riverbank and a meadow margin partly shaded by trees;  I. parviflora  and  I. noli-tangere  in VelkÃ½ Osek (50Â°6â€²42.770â€³N, 15Â°10â€²10.635â€³E) in a flooded forest and forest gaps. Due to the low seed production, seeds of  I. noli-tangere  were collected also in Peklo by NovÃ© MÄ›sto nad MetujÃ­ (50Â°21â€²28.501â€³N, 16Â°9â€²48.858â€³E) in a flooded forest and clearings and mixed together with those from VelkÃ½ Osek. Altogether at least 15 000 seeds from at least 1000 individuals of each species were taken. After the collection, seeds of  I. noli-tangere  were kept in refrigerator at 3 Â°C on heat-sterilized wet river sand in the Petri-dishes as dry storage decreases the seed germination considerably ( PerglovÃ¡  et al . 2009 ). Seeds of  I. parviflora  and  I. glandulifera  were stored in paper bags at room temperature.  Seed doses of target species and competitor under different levels of total plant and competitor density. *The number of seeds was increased in species where we expected poor germination ( PerglovÃ¡  et al . 2009 ) to achieve comparable numbers of emerged seedlings. In  I. noli-tangere  the number of seeds was enhanced from two to four and from six to eight, and in  I. parviflora  from two to three and from six to seven.  In order to test the influence of environmental factors on species performance and competitive interactions, plants were grown under two water and shading levels in a full factorial design, hereafter referred to as moderate shade/low water; deep shade/low water; moderate shade/high water and deep shade/high water treatments. Due to logistic reasons plants exposed to the same treatment were grown together in the same experimental bed. The experimental design therefore consisted of a total of four experimental beds. Plants under high water treatment were watered twice a day in the morning and evening with tap water. The low water treatments were watered only when plant wilting was noticed. The aim was to induce water stress in the low water treatment and to provide full water supply in the high water treatment. The average soil moisture was 21.2 % in the low water treatments and 29.6 % in the high water treatments. The moisture was measured only once in every fifth pot (to obtain information about the difference between the treatments, not for the purpose of an analysis) on 20 June 2012, one day after the last rain and âˆ¼6 h after watering the plants in the morning. Shading levels were achieved by using a green garden shading net transmitting 10 and 65 % of incident radiation, without any significant change in light spectrum, for deep and moderate shade, respectively.  In total, the experiment consisted of 960 pots (4 environmental treatments Ã— 24 species-density-competition combinations Ã— 10 replicates). In all four beds, pots containing  I. glandulifera  plants (both no-competitor controls and pairs) were placed in separate sections, separated by 1 m from pots without it, to avoid unwanted shading by tall  I. glandulifera . Pots were randomized within the sections and separated by 20 cm.  Unfortunately, very low emergence of  I. glandulifera  seedlings was recorded in the deep shade/high water bed. This was probably due to an anomalous warm episode in January when some of the seeds of  I. glandulifera  germinated and were killed afterwards by frost. The frost affected only this one bed probably because it was located lower on the slope than the others and could be exposed to cooler air accumulating in the lower part of the garden. Thus, we excluded the bed from all analyses.  The first sampling was carried out on 3â€“4 April 2012, after the seedlings emerged in the majority of pots, and the number of plants was recorded. Later samplings were done in 3-week intervals: April 26â€“27, May 14â€“16, June 4â€“5, and the number of plants and their mean height (taken as the height of the layer with the maximum density of leaves) were recorded. Plants were harvested in July, when they reached maximum size and the first symptoms of senescence appeared in  I. noli-tangere  and  I. parviflora : after recording the same characteristics as on previous samplings, the plants were clipped at soil level and sorted by species. As capsules are released after seed maturation and only peduncles remain attached to the stem, we used peduncles as a proxy of the reproductive output. The peduncles were clipped from the plants, and counted. For technical reasons (extreme time demand), peduncles were analysed only in 60 % of the sections in each of moderate shade/low water and deep shade/low water treatments. The complete biomass, i.e. that of vegetative parts and peduncles, was dried at 70 Â°C for 24 h and weighed.  Overview of analyses within the study. Life-cycle completion = number of individuals per species in the pot at the time of harvest divided by the number of sown seeds; biomass = mean weight of individual at the time of harvest; fecundity = mean number of capsules per individual at the time of harvest; temporal variation = mean height of individuals of target species divided by mean height of individual of competitor at the four time-sequential measurements.  1 Shade and water levels.  All three datasets were analysed by means of linear regressions. The competitor density was expressed as the number of emerged competing individuals in the pot and used as a continuous variable in the analyses. The effects of environmental treatment and competitor identity were further tested by Tukey HSD post-hoc comparisons. Some of our response variables were ratios (life-cycle completion and temporal variation), where the underlying statistical distribution generating the data is binomial or Î², respectively, however, the observed values lay within the range of 0.2â€“0.8, where linear approximation of functional relationships and assumption of normal distribution of errors is relatively reasonable ( Crawley 2007 ). The assumptions of linear regression were checked by plotting the diagnostic graphs ( Crawley 2007 ). All response variables with the exception of the life-cycle completion and temporal variation analyses had to be log-transformed in order to meet the assumption of homogeneity of variance. The estimates of life-cycle completion differed in their precision among the pots, since they were based on different numbers of seed sown or capsules produced (respectively). This was reflected in the analysis by setting these totals as weights in the corresponding linear regressions. We included the pot identity in the analysis of the temporal dataset in order to account for hierarchical structure in data (i.e. four repeated measurements from an individual pot, see TableÂ  2 ). Given the pseudoreplication of our environmental treatments, responses to environmental conditions should be interpreted with caution. All computations were undertaken in the R 2.15.3 statistical environment (R Core development team, available at  www.r-project.org ).

Triangle:  I. glandulifera  (target) with  I. parviflora  (competitor), circle:  I. glandulifera  with  I. noli-tangere , square:  I. parviflora  with  I. noli-tangere . The dashed line represents equal height of both competitors.  Our results indicate that environmental variables and competition play a different role in the plant life-cycle completion and growth response of the three  Impatiens  species. Overall, competition was a more important factor than environmental conditions for all variables except for the life-cycle completion of plants over the growing season, which points to the importance of competitive interactions in evaluation of plant fitness and potential invasion success. This suggests that for the studied  Impatiens  species, the environment plays a role in early stages of the invasion process while competition becomes more important when it comes to the naturalization phase ( Blackburn  et al . 2011 ) and could act as a mechanism preventing the non-native species from colonizing the resident communities ( Levine  et al . 2004 ;  Davies  et al . 2010 ).  Life-cycle completion was surprisingly little affected by total plant density (with the only exception being a suppression of  I. parviflora  at high densities), indicating rather negligible self-thinning in our experimental populations. This contradicts reports from field studies, where a strong thinning to adult plant densities of  I. glandulifera  between 25 and 30 individuals/m 2  from a seed rain of âˆ¼5000â€“6000 seeds/m 2  was observed ( Perrins  et al . 1990 ). The stronger thinning in the field can be attributed to seed predation and impact of other enemies ( DostÃ¡l 2010 ), disturbances and large spatio-temporal heterogeneity in environmental factors, especially in soil moistureâ€”factors from which plants are protected in an experimental garden. There is also a difference in the spatial pattern of seedling emergence; as seed dispersal in the field is random, seeds may emerge in dense patches, where it is impossible for the majority of plants to survive until maturity.  In contrast, environment had strong effect on life-cycle completion.  Impatiens glandulifera  performed poorly in moderate shade, if competing with the other invasive congener,  I. parviflora ; this could result from intensified light stress in the seedling stage due to a lack of shading by the low-statured seedlings of  I. parviflora . Such a conclusion is supported by the fact that in the field  I. glandulifera  avoids full sunlight ( ÄŒuda  et al . 2014 ). The native species  I. noli-tangere  generally showed the best performance of all three congeners in terms of the proportion of individuals that completed the life-cycle, which indicates that it may be better adapted to local conditions than the two alien species ( Alexander  et al . 2011 ). The number of individuals of  I. noli-tangere  that completed the life-cycle increased under high water supply ( ÄŒuda  et al . 2014 ).  In contrast to life-cycle completion, biomass and fecundity were strongly influenced by competition and slightly by environment. As expected, density had a strong negative effect on the biomass and fecundity of all species, which is in accordance with the law of constant final yield ( Harper 1977 ), except for the fecundity of  I. glandulifera.  Although  I. glandulifera  was the poorest among all the species studied in terms of the life-cycle completion, the surviving plants were able to dominate the pots regardless of the competitor presence and abundance. The fecundity of  I. glandulifera  plants was not significantly affected by the congeners, both native and invasive, which also indicates this species' competitive superiority. The biomass of  I. glandulifera  decreased in competition with the native  I. noli-tangere , but its fecundity remained unaffected despite a close correlation of the number of capsules with biomass. This contradiction can be interpreted as a sign of plasticity in allocation of assimilates into the seed production ( Berg and Ellers 2010 ). Due to the limited occurrence of  I. glandulifera  in woodlands ( Beerling and Perrins 1993 ), reflecting a higher demand for light than is available under dense canopies ( Maule  et al . 2000 ;  ÄŒuda  et al . 2014 ), we expected lower fecundity of plants exposed to shade. However, the seed production was similar in both shading treatments. The ability of  I. glandulifera  to produce seeds until the very end of the growing season contributes to its superiority over its congeners. The biomass of  I. glandulifera  was not negatively influenced by low water supply (similar to  Maule  et al . 2000 ;  SkÃ¡lovÃ¡  et al . 2013 ;  ÄŒuda  et al . 2014 ), despite this species being traditionally considered a water-demanding plant ( Beerling and Perrins 1993 ). On the other hand, the biomass of  I. glandulifera  decreased in the high water treatment, a phenomenon possibly associated with the high water content in its stems. Water is important to maintain turgor in the supporting structures. High water content, âˆ¼96 %, is maintained by nitrate accumulation, which is used as an osmoticum in stems and leaves ( Andrews  et al . 2009 ). If water supply is insufficient, the plants have to invest more into cellulose in the stem structure. This opinion is supported by the plants reaching similar height in the low and high water treatments. High water content due to nitrate accumulation in place of organic molecules in stems enables the species to achieve substantial height at low irradiance ( Andrews  et al . 2009 ) or for instance to invest the assimilates into increased fecundity. The biomass and fecundity of  I. parviflora  were reduced in competition with both congeners, more so if the competition was intense; this shows that this is the weakest competitor of the three species. The native  I. noli-tangere  produced less biomass and fewer capsules when grown alone than in competition with  I. parviflora . This means that  I. noli-tangere  suffers more from intraspecific competition than from interspecific competition with  I. parviflora  and, therefore, it has limited impact on  I. noli-tangere  under most conditions except for strong water limitation ( SkÃ¡lovÃ¡  et al . 2012 ). This is contrary to  TichÃ½ (1997)  and  FaliÅ„ski (1998) , who supposed that  I. parviflora  could influence  I. noli-tangere  by competition, but did not test this hypothesis experimentally. Biomass and fecundity of  I. noli-tangere  decreased across all environmental treatments in competition with  I. glandulifera  and increased with  I. parviflora  compared with monospecific control. This indicates an intermediate position of the native species in the competitive hierarchy within the members of the genus occurring in the studied region, and its ability to resist the competition by the less invasive alien congener. However, its ability to resist is context specific. For example the presence and timing of disturbances is very important, because the species differ in the time of setting seeds. In general,  I. parviflora  suppresses  I. noli-tangere  in very dry conditions ( SkÃ¡lovÃ¡  et al . 2012 ) and  I. glandulifera  outcompetes it wherever  I. noli-tangere  is able to survive.  Although  I. glandulifera  was not the tallest at the beginning of the experiment, it overtopped both congeners rather early and its superiority increased during the growing season. The ability of  I. glandulifera  to grow through the whole vegetation period facilitates its competitive dominance and also increases its propagule pressure, because plants flower and fruit from July to the first frost ( Beerling and Perrins 1993 ). On the other hand, the height ratio between  I. parviflora  and  I. noli-tangere  was relatively consistent, with  I. parviflora  being shorter all the time.  The results suggest that the effect of competitor density on the performance of invasive  Impatiens  species exceeds that of environmental factors. Competitive interactions with co-occurring congeners may be thus a more important predictor of the invasion success of an invasive species and its population dynamics than its response to abiotic factors, and should be taken into account when evaluating their invasion potential.  The high invasiveness of  I. glandulifera  seems to result from its competitive dominance over the other congeners across varying environmental conditions of light and moisture. A main mechanism underlying this species' success is fast growth resulting in tall stature, which enables the plants to exploit available light and ability to still growing over the whole vegetation period. On the other hand, success of  I. parviflora  is definitely not caused by its competitive strength, but probably by its ability to avoid competition by tolerance of extreme conditions. Competitive exclusion of the native species  I. noli-tangere  is likely to occur from the stands with co-occurring  I. glandulifera , but in mixed stands with the other invasive congener,  I. parviflora , the impact on the native species will probably be limited.
