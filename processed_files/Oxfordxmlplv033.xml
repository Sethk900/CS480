The results suggest that the effect of competition on the performance of invasive <italic>Impatiens</italic> species exceeds that of environmental factors, i.e. light and soil moisture. Competitive interactions with co-occurring congeners may thus be a more important predictor of the invasion success of an invasive species and its population dynamics than its response to abiotic factors, and should be taken into account when evaluating their invasion potential.Many invasive species are considered competitively superior to native species, with the strongest competition expected in species with similar niches and/or in closely related species. However, competition outcome is strongly context-dependent as competitive strength varies along environmental gradients, and life stages, and also depends on abundances. To explore the importance of these factors, we examined competition effects in an experiment with three <italic>Impatiens</italic> species (Balsaminaceae) widespread in central Europe and sharing similar life-history characteristics and habitats: the native <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic>, and two invasive species, <italic>I. parviflora</italic> and <italic>I. glandulifera</italic>. We compared their competitive strength and reciprocal impacts under two levels of water and light availability, two overall planting densities and three competitor densities. We assessed species performance (ability to complete the life-cycle, biomass and fecundity) and temporal competition dynamics in a garden pot experiment. Environmental variables had lower explanatory power than overall planting and competitor density, which indicates the importance of competitive interactions when evaluating plant performance and potential invasion success. Despite poor and delayed germination, the invasive <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> attained dominance even at a high competitor density and was competitively superior across all treatments, exceeding the height of both congeners. <italic>Impatiens parviflora</italic> was competitively weakest, having a negligible impact on both native <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic> and invasive <italic>I. glandulifera</italic>. The intermediate competitive strength of the native <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic> probably results from its intermediate height, and good germination rate and timing. The difference in height among species increased during the experiment when <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> was involved; this species continues growing until autumn, enhancing its competitive superiority. The results provide a mechanistic understanding for the competitive exclusion of native <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic> that occurs in stands with <italic>I. glandulifera</italic>, but the limited impact of <italic>I. parviflora</italic> on <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic> in their mixed stands.Non-native species have to overcome numerous barriers to naturalize and become invasive in the introduced range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C64">Richardson <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C9">Blackburn <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). While immediately after introduction into a new range the species need to cope with the local environment, especially climatic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C78">Wiens and Graham 2005</xref>), later on different mechanisms involving interactions, or their absence, with resident biota come into play. It has been suggested that some invading species can exploit resources not used by plants in resident communities (empty niche hypothesis; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C27">Elton 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C40">Lambdon <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>), which results in minimizing or even avoiding competitive interactions with co-occurring species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C43">MacArthur 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C16">Crawley 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C44">MacDougall <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>). On the other hand, the outcome of interactions with resident organisms, especially competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C42">Levine <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>), have been repeatedly found to be important for successful invasion of local communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C66">Sakai <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C42">Levine <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C76">VilÃ  and Weiner 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C45">Maherali and Klironomos 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C37">Hierro <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). In particular case studies, competitive advantage of invading species is often attributed to traits such as high germination rate, good survival, fast growth, early or late flowering, high fecundity and tall stature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C6">Baker 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C58">PyÅ¡ek and Richardson 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C39">KubeÅ¡ovÃ¡ <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C51">MoravcovÃ¡ <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C74">van Kleunen <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C54">Pellock <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>).Nevertheless, alien invaders were not found to be significantly competitively superior to native species in an analysis of available case studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C20">Daehler 2003</xref>). The outcome of competition depended on the environmental context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C20">Daehler 2003</xref>), e.g. on water availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C29">Franzese and Ghermandi 2014</xref>), shading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C50">Molina-Montenegro <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>) or nutrient supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C57">Powell and Knight 2009</xref>). The competitive hierarchy of alien and native species changes along environmental gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C49">Milberg <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C67">Shea and Chesson 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C53">Pathikonda <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>), with competitive strength of invaders usually decreasing towards more extreme conditions, such as, for example, high altitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C21">Daehler 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C2">Alexander <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C59">PyÅ¡ek <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). However, many invasive species possess a high phenotypic plasticity which makes them capable of adapting to a wide range of environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C30">Funk 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C8">Berg and Ellers 2010</xref>). This corresponds to invasive plants often being generalists with a broad tolerance of ecological conditions, but exploiting resources less effectively than specialists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C63">Richards <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>).The strength of competition between species depends on the degree to which their niches overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C38">Hutchinson 1957</xref>), with two species occupying the same niche unable to co-exist over the long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C33">Hardin 1960</xref>). The strongest competition is expected in closely related species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C22">Darwin 1859</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C26">Elton 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C45">Maherali and Klironomos 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C77">Violle <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, some studies have found no linkage between the relatedness of competing species and the competition strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C11">Cahill <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>) or reported even an opposite pattern, with less intense competition between closely related species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C24">Diez <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C48">Mayfield and Levine 2010</xref>). Strong competition was suggested as the reason why invasive species from families with numerous members in native floras are under-represented in floras of target regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C62">RejmÃ¡nek 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C19">Daehler 2001</xref>).Despite some studies testing for the competitive superiority of invasive plants over native plants under a range of environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C57">Powell and Knight 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C50">Molina-Montenegro <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C29">Franzese and Ghermandi 2014</xref>), the competitive relationships between these two groups of species have rarely been tested along the gradient of competitor densities (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C41">Leger and Espeland 2010</xref>). Moreover, studies focusing on a reciprocal impact of native species on invasive species are still the exception rather than the rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C41">Leger and Espeland 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C12">Carvallo <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>).The rationale of our study stems from the well-established notion that high-density results in severe competition for resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C5">Antonovics and Levin 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C68">Silvertown and Charlesworth 2009</xref>). Invasive species often gain an advantage over their native competitors under high resource supply, but stressful conditions can reverse the hierarchy, leading to a competitive advantage of natives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C20">Daehler 2003</xref>). Density-dependent effects may differ across life stages, with the strongest effect found in the emergence stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C31">Goldberg <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). For intraspecific competition, high plant density usually decreases biomass and the number of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C5">Antonovics and Levin 1980</xref>). On the other hand, density effects have rarely been found to be significant in interspecific competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C14">Connolly <italic>et al</italic>. 1990</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C4">Antonovics and Fowler 1985</xref>).To obtain a deeper insight into competitive interactions between native and invasive species under manipulated environmental conditions, varying plant densities and different life stages, we used three annual <italic>Impatiens</italic> species occurring in Central Europe: native <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic> and invasive <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> and <italic>I. parviflora</italic>. Using congeners minimizes phylogenetic biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C10">Burns 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C32">Grotkopp and RejmÃ¡nek 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C74">van Kleunen <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>) as well as those associated with other traits such as life history or dispersal mode. Due to the overlap of the species' niches, which brings them into direct contact in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C18">ÄŒuda <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>), we expected strong interspecific competition to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C46">Matesanz <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). It is of interest to understand the ecological interactions among the <italic>Impatiens</italic> species because highly invasive <italic>I. glandulifera</italic>, which has historically colonized river banks, is currently spreading into novel habits such as clearings and roadsides distant from the river courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C36">Hejda and PyÅ¡ek 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C18">ÄŒuda <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>). Since environmental conditions and dispersal vectors in these novel habitats differ from those acting in river corridors, the competitive interactions among this invader and co-occurring species might be changing. It is thus necessary to establish the competitive hierarchies of the three species across a range of seed availability and environmental conditions. A previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C18">ÄŒuda <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>) revealed that shade, and moisture drive <italic>Impatiens</italic> distributions in the field. As such, we assessed these factors in a common garden experiment designed to capture the reciprocal effects of competition between species. Specifically, we answer the following questions. (i) What is the effect of density-dependent congeneric competition and environmental conditions on the ability of plants to complete their life-cycle? (ii) How do these factors affect plant biomass and fecundity? (iii) How does the effect of competition change over time with respect to the life stages?All three studied <italic>Impatiens</italic> (Balsaminaceae) species are annuals with similar biological characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C15">Coombe 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C7">Beerling and Perrins 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C35">Hatcher 2003</xref>) and habitat preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C71">SlavÃ­k 1997</xref>), but with different origin and invasion status in the Czech Republic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C60">PyÅ¡ek <italic>et al</italic>. 2012<italic>a</italic></xref>). They partly differ in germination rates and stratification demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C55">PerglovÃ¡ <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>), but in the field the majority of seedlings emerge within one month (April) (J. ÄŒuda, pers. obs). The presence of all three species is dependent on disturbances and they therefore often occur in early successional herbaceous communities. At the same locality, the spatial pattern of the occurrence of individual <italic>Impatiens</italic> species is driven by canopy closure and water availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C18">ÄŒuda <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>).<italic>Impatiens noli-tangere</italic> L., a native species, grows in damp forests, at clearings, along watercourses and around springs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C71">SlavÃ­k 1997</xref>). It is recorded from 39 habitat types in the Czech Republic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C65">SÃ¡dlo <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>). Its height varies depending on local conditions from 20 to 120 cm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C35">Hatcher 2003</xref>). The plants flower from July to August and set seed from mid-July to end of August. It is reported that it may be suppressed by competition from invasive <italic>I. parviflora</italic>, with which it often co-occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C73">TichÃ½ 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C28">FaliÅ„ski 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C13">Chmura and Sierka 2007</xref>) as well as by competition from <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C75">Vervoort <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C18">ÄŒuda <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>).<italic>Impatiens parviflora</italic> DC., an invasive species, is characterized by a height similar to that of <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C15">Coombe 1956</xref>) and a broad ecological amplitude, being recorded from 45 habitat types in the Czech Republic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C65">SÃ¡dlo <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C61">PyÅ¡ek <italic>et al</italic>. 2012<italic>b</italic></xref>). It often grows as a dominant in nitrophilous herbaceous vegetation at shady mesic sites, in alluvial forests, oak-hornbeam forests, ravine forests and spruce or <italic>Robinia pseudoacacia</italic> plantations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C61">PyÅ¡ek <italic>et al</italic>. 2012<italic>b</italic></xref>). The plants flower from mid-June to October, setting seed from late June until the first autumn frosts.<italic>Impatiens glandulifera</italic> Royle, a highly invasive species, occurs predominantly along rivers, but has been recently colonizing forest clearings and margins, wet ditches, forest roads and ruderal sites. It is recorded from 16 habitat types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C65">SÃ¡dlo <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C61">PyÅ¡ek <italic>et al</italic>. 2012<italic>b</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C52">Pahl <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>) but the number is expected to increase due to the ongoing spread. The plants flower from late July until the first frosts, setting seeds from late August. Due to high seed production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C51">MoravcovÃ¡ <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>) and tall stature up to 3 m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C1">Adamowski 2008</xref>), it is highly competitive and able to replace the native flora in invaded sites.Seeds were collected from large established populations, extending over 2500 m<sup>2</sup> in July and August 2011. Seeds of <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> were collected in Bohuslavice nad MetujÃ­ (50Â°18â€²4.315â€³N, 16Â°5â€²22.730â€³E) along a riverbank and a meadow margin partly shaded by trees; <italic>I. parviflora</italic> and <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic> in VelkÃ½ Osek (50Â°6â€²42.770â€³N, 15Â°10â€²10.635â€³E) in a flooded forest and forest gaps. Due to the low seed production, seeds of <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic> were collected also in Peklo by NovÃ© MÄ›sto nad MetujÃ­ (50Â°21â€²28.501â€³N, 16Â°9â€²48.858â€³E) in a flooded forest and clearings and mixed together with those from VelkÃ½ Osek. Altogether at least 15 000 seeds from at least 1000 individuals of each species were taken. After the collection, seeds of <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic> were kept in refrigerator at 3 Â°C on heat-sterilized wet river sand in the Petri-dishes as dry storage decreases the seed germination considerably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C55">PerglovÃ¡ <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>). Seeds of <italic>I. parviflora</italic> and <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> were stored in paper bags at room temperature.Seed doses of target species and competitor under different levels of total plant and competitor density. *The number of seeds was increased in species where we expected poor germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C55">PerglovÃ¡ <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>) to achieve comparable numbers of emerged seedlings. In <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic> the number of seeds was enhanced from two to four and from six to eight, and in <italic>I. parviflora</italic> from two to three and from six to seven.In order to test the influence of environmental factors on species performance and competitive interactions, plants were grown under two water and shading levels in a full factorial design, hereafter referred to as moderate shade/low water; deep shade/low water; moderate shade/high water and deep shade/high water treatments. Due to logistic reasons plants exposed to the same treatment were grown together in the same experimental bed. The experimental design therefore consisted of a total of four experimental beds. Plants under high water treatment were watered twice a day in the morning and evening with tap water. The low water treatments were watered only when plant wilting was noticed. The aim was to induce water stress in the low water treatment and to provide full water supply in the high water treatment. The average soil moisture was 21.2 % in the low water treatments and 29.6 % in the high water treatments. The moisture was measured only once in every fifth pot (to obtain information about the difference between the treatments, not for the purpose of an analysis) on 20 June 2012, one day after the last rain and âˆ¼6 h after watering the plants in the morning. Shading levels were achieved by using a green garden shading net transmitting 10 and 65 % of incident radiation, without any significant change in light spectrum, for deep and moderate shade, respectively.In total, the experiment consisted of 960 pots (4 environmental treatments Ã— 24 species-density-competition combinations Ã— 10 replicates). In all four beds, pots containing <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> plants (both no-competitor controls and pairs) were placed in separate sections, separated by 1 m from pots without it, to avoid unwanted shading by tall <italic>I. glandulifera</italic>. Pots were randomized within the sections and separated by 20 cm.Unfortunately, very low emergence of <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> seedlings was recorded in the deep shade/high water bed. This was probably due to an anomalous warm episode in January when some of the seeds of <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> germinated and were killed afterwards by frost. The frost affected only this one bed probably because it was located lower on the slope than the others and could be exposed to cooler air accumulating in the lower part of the garden. Thus, we excluded the bed from all analyses.The first sampling was carried out on 3â€“4 April 2012, after the seedlings emerged in the majority of pots, and the number of plants was recorded. Later samplings were done in 3-week intervals: April 26â€“27, May 14â€“16, June 4â€“5, and the number of plants and their mean height (taken as the height of the layer with the maximum density of leaves) were recorded. Plants were harvested in July, when they reached maximum size and the first symptoms of senescence appeared in <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic> and <italic>I. parviflora</italic>: after recording the same characteristics as on previous samplings, the plants were clipped at soil level and sorted by species. As capsules are released after seed maturation and only peduncles remain attached to the stem, we used peduncles as a proxy of the reproductive output. The peduncles were clipped from the plants, and counted. For technical reasons (extreme time demand), peduncles were analysed only in 60 % of the sections in each of moderate shade/low water and deep shade/low water treatments. The complete biomass, i.e. that of vegetative parts and peduncles, was dried at 70 Â°C for 24 h and weighed.Overview of analyses within the study. Life-cycle completion = number of individuals per species in the pot at the time of harvest divided by the number of sown seeds; biomass = mean weight of individual at the time of harvest; fecundity = mean number of capsules per individual at the time of harvest; temporal variation = mean height of individuals of target species divided by mean height of individual of competitor at the four time-sequential measurements. <sup>1</sup>Shade and water levels.All three datasets were analysed by means of linear regressions. The competitor density was expressed as the number of emerged competing individuals in the pot and used as a continuous variable in the analyses. The effects of environmental treatment and competitor identity were further tested by Tukey HSD post-hoc comparisons. Some of our response variables were ratios (life-cycle completion and temporal variation), where the underlying statistical distribution generating the data is binomial or Î², respectively, however, the observed values lay within the range of 0.2â€“0.8, where linear approximation of functional relationships and assumption of normal distribution of errors is relatively reasonable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C17">Crawley 2007</xref>). The assumptions of linear regression were checked by plotting the diagnostic graphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C17">Crawley 2007</xref>). All response variables with the exception of the life-cycle completion and temporal variation analyses had to be log-transformed in order to meet the assumption of homogeneity of variance. The estimates of life-cycle completion differed in their precision among the pots, since they were based on different numbers of seed sown or capsules produced (respectively). This was reflected in the analysis by setting these totals as weights in the corresponding linear regressions. We included the pot identity in the analysis of the temporal dataset in order to account for hierarchical structure in data (i.e. four repeated measurements from an individual pot, see TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLV033TB2">2</xref>). Given the pseudoreplication of our environmental treatments, responses to environmental conditions should be interpreted with caution. All computations were undertaken in the R 2.15.3 statistical environment (R Core development team, available at <uri xlink:href="www.r-project.org" xlink:type="simple">www.r-project.org</uri>).The influence of three strongest factors from analysis of particular species (according to explanatory power) on <italic>Impatiens</italic> fitness.

To visualize the effect of competitor density (B), we divided this continuous variable into two categories: low competitor density = under mean competitor number and high competitor density = above mean competitor number. We omitted the graph for <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> for which no significant effects of competition were found.The temporal competition dynamics expressed as change in the ratio in target species height/(target plant + competitor height). TS, target species. At zero time the first seedlings emerged; height was first measured 22 days later. Triangle: <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> (target) with <italic>I. parviflora</italic> (competitor), circle: <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> with <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic>, square: <italic>I. parviflora</italic> with <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic>. The dashed line represents equal height of both competitors.Our results indicate that environmental variables and competition play a different role in the plant life-cycle completion and growth response of the three <italic>Impatiens</italic> species. Overall, competition was a more important factor than environmental conditions for all variables except for the life-cycle completion of plants over the growing season, which points to the importance of competitive interactions in evaluation of plant fitness and potential invasion success. This suggests that for the studied <italic>Impatiens</italic> species, the environment plays a role in early stages of the invasion process while competition becomes more important when it comes to the naturalization phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C9">Blackburn <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>) and could act as a mechanism preventing the non-native species from colonizing the resident communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C42">Levine <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C23">Davies <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>).Life-cycle completion was surprisingly little affected by total plant density (with the only exception being a suppression of <italic>I. parviflora</italic> at high densities), indicating rather negligible self-thinning in our experimental populations. This contradicts reports from field studies, where a strong thinning to adult plant densities of <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> between 25 and 30 individuals/m<sup>2</sup> from a seed rain of âˆ¼5000â€“6000 seeds/m<sup>2</sup> was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C56">Perrins <italic>et al</italic>. 1990</xref>). The stronger thinning in the field can be attributed to seed predation and impact of other enemies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C25">DostÃ¡l 2010</xref>), disturbances and large spatio-temporal heterogeneity in environmental factors, especially in soil moistureâ€”factors from which plants are protected in an experimental garden. There is also a difference in the spatial pattern of seedling emergence; as seed dispersal in the field is random, seeds may emerge in dense patches, where it is impossible for the majority of plants to survive until maturity.In contrast, environment had strong effect on life-cycle completion. <italic>Impatiens glandulifera</italic> performed poorly in moderate shade, if competing with the other invasive congener, <italic>I. parviflora</italic>; this could result from intensified light stress in the seedling stage due to a lack of shading by the low-statured seedlings of <italic>I. parviflora</italic>. Such a conclusion is supported by the fact that in the field <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> avoids full sunlight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C18">ÄŒuda <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>). The native species <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic> generally showed the best performance of all three congeners in terms of the proportion of individuals that completed the life-cycle, which indicates that it may be better adapted to local conditions than the two alien species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C2">Alexander <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). The number of individuals of <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic> that completed the life-cycle increased under high water supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C18">ÄŒuda <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>).In contrast to life-cycle completion, biomass and fecundity were strongly influenced by competition and slightly by environment. As expected, density had a strong negative effect on the biomass and fecundity of all species, which is in accordance with the law of constant final yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C34">Harper 1977</xref>), except for the fecundity of <italic>I. glandulifera.</italic> Although <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> was the poorest among all the species studied in terms of the life-cycle completion, the surviving plants were able to dominate the pots regardless of the competitor presence and abundance. The fecundity of <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> plants was not significantly affected by the congeners, both native and invasive, which also indicates this species' competitive superiority. The biomass of <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> decreased in competition with the native <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic>, but its fecundity remained unaffected despite a close correlation of the number of capsules with biomass. This contradiction can be interpreted as a sign of plasticity in allocation of assimilates into the seed production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C8">Berg and Ellers 2010</xref>). Due to the limited occurrence of <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> in woodlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C7">Beerling and Perrins 1993</xref>), reflecting a higher demand for light than is available under dense canopies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C47">Maule <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C18">ÄŒuda <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>), we expected lower fecundity of plants exposed to shade. However, the seed production was similar in both shading treatments. The ability of <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> to produce seeds until the very end of the growing season contributes to its superiority over its congeners. The biomass of <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> was not negatively influenced by low water supply (similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C47">Maule <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C70">SkÃ¡lovÃ¡ <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C18">ÄŒuda <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>), despite this species being traditionally considered a water-demanding plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C7">Beerling and Perrins 1993</xref>). On the other hand, the biomass of <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> decreased in the high water treatment, a phenomenon possibly associated with the high water content in its stems. Water is important to maintain turgor in the supporting structures. High water content, âˆ¼96 %, is maintained by nitrate accumulation, which is used as an osmoticum in stems and leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C3">Andrews <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>). If water supply is insufficient, the plants have to invest more into cellulose in the stem structure. This opinion is supported by the plants reaching similar height in the low and high water treatments. High water content due to nitrate accumulation in place of organic molecules in stems enables the species to achieve substantial height at low irradiance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C3">Andrews <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>) or for instance to invest the assimilates into increased fecundity. The biomass and fecundity of <italic>I. parviflora</italic> were reduced in competition with both congeners, more so if the competition was intense; this shows that this is the weakest competitor of the three species. The native <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic> produced less biomass and fewer capsules when grown alone than in competition with <italic>I. parviflora</italic>. This means that <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic> suffers more from intraspecific competition than from interspecific competition with <italic>I. parviflora</italic> and, therefore, it has limited impact on <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic> under most conditions except for strong water limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C69">SkÃ¡lovÃ¡ <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). This is contrary to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C73">TichÃ½ (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C28">FaliÅ„ski (1998)</xref>, who supposed that <italic>I. parviflora</italic> could influence <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic> by competition, but did not test this hypothesis experimentally. Biomass and fecundity of <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic> decreased across all environmental treatments in competition with <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> and increased with <italic>I. parviflora</italic> compared with monospecific control. This indicates an intermediate position of the native species in the competitive hierarchy within the members of the genus occurring in the studied region, and its ability to resist the competition by the less invasive alien congener. However, its ability to resist is context specific. For example the presence and timing of disturbances is very important, because the species differ in the time of setting seeds. In general, <italic>I. parviflora</italic> suppresses <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic> in very dry conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C69">SkÃ¡lovÃ¡ <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>) and <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> outcompetes it wherever <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic> is able to survive.Although <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> was not the tallest at the beginning of the experiment, it overtopped both congeners rather early and its superiority increased during the growing season. The ability of <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> to grow through the whole vegetation period facilitates its competitive dominance and also increases its propagule pressure, because plants flower and fruit from July to the first frost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLV033C7">Beerling and Perrins 1993</xref>). On the other hand, the height ratio between <italic>I. parviflora</italic> and <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic> was relatively consistent, with <italic>I. parviflora</italic> being shorter all the time.The results suggest that the effect of competitor density on the performance of invasive <italic>Impatiens</italic> species exceeds that of environmental factors. Competitive interactions with co-occurring congeners may be thus a more important predictor of the invasion success of an invasive species and its population dynamics than its response to abiotic factors, and should be taken into account when evaluating their invasion potential.The high invasiveness of <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> seems to result from its competitive dominance over the other congeners across varying environmental conditions of light and moisture. A main mechanism underlying this species' success is fast growth resulting in tall stature, which enables the plants to exploit available light and ability to still growing over the whole vegetation period. On the other hand, success of <italic>I. parviflora</italic> is definitely not caused by its competitive strength, but probably by its ability to avoid competition by tolerance of extreme conditions. Competitive exclusion of the native species <italic>I. noli-tangere</italic> is likely to occur from the stands with co-occurring <italic>I. glandulifera</italic>, but in mixed stands with the other invasive congener, <italic>I. parviflora</italic>, the impact on the native species will probably be limited.This study was funded by Praemium Academiae award from the <grant-sponsor xlink:type="simple">Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic</grant-sponsor> to P.P., long-term research development project RVO <grant-num xlink:type="simple">67985939</grant-num> (<grant-sponsor xlink:type="simple">Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic</grant-sponsor>) and institutional resources of the <grant-sponsor xlink:type="simple">Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports of the Czech Republic</grant-sponsor>.All listed authors wrote the manuscript; J.ÄŒ., H.S. and P.P. designed the experiment; J.ÄŒ. and H.S. collected the data and Z.J. conducted the statistical analyses.None declared.The following additional information is available in the online version of this article â€“<bold>Table S1.</bold> Effects of experimental conditions on life-cycle completion (the proportion of survived individuals from seed to maturity).<bold>Table S2.</bold> Effects of experimental conditions on the average biomass of the individual.<bold>Table S3.</bold> Effects of experimental conditions on fecundity (the average number of capsules produced by an individual).<bold>Table S4.</bold> Effects of experimental conditions on the temporal variation, i.e. changes in the height ratio of the target species to the competitor during the duration of the experiment.We thank Å Ã¡rka DvoÅ™Ã¡ÄkovÃ¡, OndÅ™ej KauzÃ¡l, Ivan OstrÃ½, Ivana RajznoverovÃ¡, Michal PyÅ¡ek, KlÃ¡ra PyÅ¡kovÃ¡ and Zuzana SixtovÃ¡ for their help in the experimental garden, and Mirek Martinec, Jan Rydlo, Radka ÄŒudovÃ¡ and Adam ÄŒuda for help with seed collection.
