Our results show that there is a heavy emphasis on herbicides to manage <italic>Phragmites</italic>, relative to other methods, and a lack of information on what types of plant communities establish once <italic>Phragmites</italic> is removed. Our model of <italic>Phragmites</italic> establishment and reproduction describes the invasion as a symptom of watershed-scale land use and disturbance. We advocate more holistic approaches to control and management that focus on improving water quality and minimizing human disturbance to deter future invasion and improve resilience of native plant communities.Studies on invasive plant management are often short in duration and limited in the methods tested, and lack an adequate description of plant communities that replace the invader following removal. Here we present a comprehensive review of management studies on a single species, in an effort to elucidate future directions for research in invasive plant management. We reviewed the literature on <italic>Phragmites</italic> management in North America in an effort to synthesize our understanding of management efforts, identify gaps in knowledge and improve the efficacy of management. Additionally, we assessed recent ecological findings concerning <italic>Phragmites</italic> mechanisms of invasion and integrated these findings into our recommendations for more effective management. Our overall goal is to examine whether or not current management approaches can be improved and whether they promote reestablishment of native plant communities. We found: (i) little information on community-level recovery of vegetation following removal of <italic>Phragmites</italic>; and (ii) most management approaches focus on the removal of <italic>Phragmites</italic> from individual stands or groups of stands over a relatively small area. With a few exceptions, recovery studies did not monitor vegetation for substantial durations, thus limiting adequate evaluation of the recovery trajectory. We also found that none of the recovery studies were conducted in a landscape context, even though it is now well documented that land-use patterns on adjacent habitats influence the structure and function of wetlands, including the expansion of <italic>Phragmites</italic>. We suggest that <italic>Phragmites</italic> management needs to shift to watershed-scale efforts in coastal regions, or larger management units inland. In addition, management efforts should focus on restoring native plant communities, rather than simply eradicating <italic>Phragmites</italic> stands. Wetlands and watersheds should be prioritized to identify ecosystems that would benefit most from <italic>Phragmites</italic> management and those where the negative impact of management would be minimal.Wetlands are landscape sinks for nutrients and propagules, making them especially vulnerable to plant invasions as they are downstream from most disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C186">Zedler and Kercher 2004</xref>). One such invader, a Eurasian lineage of the common reed, <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> (hereafter referred to as <italic>Phragmites</italic>), is increasingly dominant in wetlands across North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C102">Marks <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C25">Chambers <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C143">Saltonstall 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C77">Kettenring <italic>et al.</italic> 2012<italic>b</italic></xref> in this issue). <italic>Phragmites</italic> invasions are often associated with decreases in plant biodiversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C25">Chambers <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C69">Keller 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C14">Bertness <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>), declines in habitat quality for fish and wildlife (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C43">Fell <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C44">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C51">Gratton and Denno 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C28">Chambers <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>), disruptions to biogeochemical cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C109">Meyerson <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C110">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C45">Findlay <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>) and other ecosystem services (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C82">Kiviat 2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C77">Kettenring <italic>et al.</italic> 2012<italic>b</italic></xref> in this special issue, which highlight <italic>Phragmites</italic> benefit to wildlife or lack/weaknesses of data on actual impacts). <italic>Phragmites</italic> invasion is becoming an increasingly large management concern in a variety of systems: tidal marshes along the Atlantic Coast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C25">Chambers <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C174">Warren <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C14">Bertness <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>); the Great Lakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C162">Tulbure <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C24">Carlson <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C167">Uzarski <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C184">Willcox 2013</xref>); inland brackish wetlands of the Great Basin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C71">Kettenring and Mock 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C76">Kettenring <italic>et al.</italic> 2012<italic>a</italic></xref>) and the Gulf Coast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C77">Kettenring <italic>et al.</italic> 2012<italic>b</italic></xref> in this special issue).<italic>Phragmites</italic> is a clonal, rhizomatous grass with a cosmopolitan distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C58">Haslam 1972</xref>). Several genetic lineages, including some native lineages, are present in North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C142">Saltonstall 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C143">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C112">Meyerson <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref> in this special issue; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C92">Lambertini <italic>et al.</italic> 2012<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C93"><italic>b</italic></xref> in this special issue). However, the invasion by the Eurasian genetic lineage in wetlands across North America has been striking due to its rapid spread, abundance and impacts. Eurasian <italic>Phragmites</italic>' dominance at the landscape scale has been attributed to anthropogenic factors, including hydrologic alteration, increased nutrients and global change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C113">Minchinton 2002<italic>a</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C20">Burdick and Konisky 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C145">Silliman and Bertness 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C12">Bart <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C79">King <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C18">Brisson <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C124">Mozdzer <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C75">Kettenring <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C121">Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C125">Mozdzer <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref> in this special issue). Since the turn of the 20th century, non-native <italic>Phragmites</italic> in North America has been associated with denuded soil and anthropogenic disturbance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C153">Taylor 1938</xref>), but natural disturbances also produce favourable conditions for <italic>Phragmites</italic> establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C115">Minchinton and Bertness 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C10">Baldwin <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). <italic>Phragmites</italic> thrives in freshwater and brackish wetlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C110">Meyerson <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C183">Wilcox <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>), and is expanding in managed systems like highway ditches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C99">Lelong <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C67">Jodoin <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>) and constructed wetlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C59">Havens <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>).<italic>Phragmites</italic> management strategies typically focus on the use of a limited number of techniques (described later) applied to individual patches or groups of patches. To critically and effectively evaluate restoration after an invasive species has been removed, data need to be collected to assess the initial wetland state, monitor the system through treatment (to inform adaptive management) and monitor for multiple years after treatment (see discussion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C15">Blossey 1999</xref>). However, studies on the management of invasive plants (not just those investigating <italic>Phragmites</italic>) rarely report data beyond the response of the invader (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C135">Reid <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>), and monitoring for treatment effectiveness seldom lasts more than 2 years (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C72">Kettenring and Reinhardt Adams 2011</xref>). A lack of long-term monitoring is likely due to: (i) the cultural mindset of land management agencies; and (ii) financial considerations and logistical constraints. <italic>Phragmites</italic> management in the USA has been occurring for over 35 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C138">Riemer 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C102">Marks <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>). Yet, while monitoring appears prohibitively expensive for specific projects, land managers spent over $4.6 million per year on <italic>Phragmites</italic> management across North America over a 5-year period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C104">Martin and Blossey 2013</xref>), with no published data to justify the effectiveness of these management efforts to restore native plant communities. Given that eradication of <italic>Phragmites</italic> is rare, and is not likely without many years of follow-up treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C175">Warren <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C48">Getsinger <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C76">Kettenring <italic>et al.</italic> 2012<italic>a</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C100">Lombard <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>), monitoring of treatment effectiveness should be an essential component of any management programme.Here we review current strategies for <italic>Phragmites</italic> management in North America and identify the factors that have the potential to transform future management. We begin with a literature review that addresses two central questions: (i) are current management practices successful? and (ii) do current <italic>Phragmites</italic> management practices allow for the restoration of native species assemblages? We address these questions by building upon earlier comprehensive reviews of <italic>Phragmites</italic> management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C102">Marks <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C81">Kiviat 2006</xref>) in light of recent findings on the relationships among <italic>Phragmites</italic> invasion, land use and reproductive strategies within and among <italic>Phragmites</italic> patches. We also present a conceptual model of <italic>Phragmites</italic> invasion that integrates recent research findings. We argue that <italic>Phragmites</italic> management is best approached from a holistic perspective that integrates nutrient and disturbance management at landscape scales while addressing modes of reproduction and spread.We reviewed the available literature on <italic>Phragmites</italic> management in the USA to determine: (i) which practices have been tested, (ii) where deficiencies in our knowledge exist, and (iii) what is known about recovery of native communities following attempts to eradicated <italic>Phragmites</italic>. We queried Google Scholar<sup>®</sup> and ISI Web of Science<sup>®</sup> for the technical and grey literature on <italic>Phragmites</italic> removal. We used the key words ‘<italic>Phragmites</italic> removal’ and ‘<italic>Phragmites</italic> management’ for all available dates. Articles, reports and theses from North America were included in our review (34 in total), along with reference to conclusions from previous reviews of the same topics. Only field studies that are applicable to management actions were included; meso- and microcosm studies are omitted. While our review focuses on non-native <italic>Phragmites</italic> in North America, they are presented in context with findings from other parts of the world. We did not consider <italic>Phragmites</italic> removal by hydrologic restoration in our quantitative review as that topic has recently been evaluated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C28">Chambers <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>); however, this approach is dealt with contextually when tied to another management method.Studies included in quantitative review.

One study conducted a single survey and is denoted with the time = 0 bar.Management methods used in reviewed articles. Methods used in combination are counted individually.Our review focused on four main categories of methods for controlling <italic>Phragmites</italic>: mechanical, chemical, biological and novel methods. Here we review these methods to discuss their effectiveness and to highlight research needs.Mechanical control is perhaps the first human reaction to remove an unwanted plant, and the methods vary in efficacy and degree of effort. It is largely achieved with mechanical mowing or cutting with hand tools, hand-pulling, crushing, excavation of entire plants, burning or cutting, often followed by covering the area with soil or plastic.For a perennial rhizomatous grass, mowing does little to reduce its dominance. Mowing actually stimulated shoot production and resulted in increased density of <italic>Phragmites</italic> shoots (but decreased shoot height and biomass) in both non-tidal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C54">Güsewell <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C53">Güsewell 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C6">Asaeda <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C36">Derr 2008<italic>a</italic></xref>) and tidal wetlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C174">Warren <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>).Variable results following cutting were likely due to a combination of phenology, abiotic conditions and patch size. Impacts from cutting vary relative to the phenology of the plant, due to shoot/rhizome interactions, as reserves are mobilized and stored differently according to season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C176">Weisner and Granéli 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C6">Asaeda <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref> and references therein). For example, cutting in June showed significant impacts to aboveground and rhizome biomass the following growing season, whereas cutting in July showed no significant impacts compared with controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C6">Asaeda <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>) and open wetlands to pelagic flushing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C167">Uzarski <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). External environmental factors (e.g. temperature and salinity) can influence success; cutting just before the flooding season has been reported to improve control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C102">Marks <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C81">Kiviat 2006</xref>). Some researchers report cutting treatments are less effective when soils are sandy or aerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C176">Weisner and Granéli 1989</xref>). One primitive approach broke shoots and removed them by hand (several shoots were held tight and broken below the waterline as the bases were kicked) along shorelines of five fresh water ponds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C148">Smith 2005</xref>). High water levels in all ponds resulted in broken/crushed shoots remaining underwater for an extended period and mortality ranged from 41 to 99 % after 1 year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C148">Smith 2005</xref>).On a large scale, hand cutting will largely be ineffective due to time and resources, but may be an important strategy of rapid response efforts. Overall, simply cutting will be ineffective in eliminating <italic>Phragmites</italic>, but with proper timing, cutting may help reduce dominance (through depletion of underground reserves) and control expansion.The most effective means of <italic>Phragmites</italic> mechanical control is a combination of cutting or mowing (usually in the spring) and covering stubble with plastic (for one growing season). However, there are limitations to this application; it is usually applied to small areas, as it is labour-intensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C35">Dawson and Hallows 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C17">Boone <italic>et al.</italic> 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C102">Marks <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C81">Kiviat 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C184">Willcox 2013</xref>). In one removal experiment, <italic>Phragmites</italic> shoot density averaged 0.1 m<sup>−2</sup> beneath the plastic compared with 20.7 m<sup>−2</sup> in plots without plastic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C21">Burdick <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). Thus, unless cutting is combined with plastic sheeting or herbicide, mowing alone will have little effect on <italic>Phragmites</italic> management other than containment.Burning of <italic>Phragmites</italic> provides an alternative mechanism for physical removal, similar to mowing, but burning has not been effective unless coupled with either hydrological restoration or herbicide application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C102">Marks <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>). Burning alone has produced variable results and even stimulated <italic>Phragmites</italic> growth and stand development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C168">van der Toorn and Mook 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C157">Thompson and Shay 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C33">Cross and Fleming 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C49">Granéli 1989</xref>).Cutting and burning appear to enhance control efforts if used as secondary treatments. For example, mechanical control efforts improved significantly following either herbicide use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C24">Carlson <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>) or the reintroduction of flood waters in tidal wetlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C61">Hellings and Gallagher 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C154">Teal and Peterson 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C48">Getsinger <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). In some instances, burning to remove standing dead biomass in winter was found to enhance control following restoration of tidal exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C152">Sun <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). Burning aboveground shoots (or other methods like cutting or crushing) followed by flooding can be used to cut off the oxygen flow to the rhizomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C176">Weisner and Granéli 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C139">Rolletschek <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>).Removal or mulching of the aboveground material following cutting has been recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C102">Marks <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C81">Kiviat 2006</xref>), even though removal and disposal involves more effort to prevent recolonization from rhizomes. Burning removes the dead thatch and aids in the regeneration of native plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C1">Ailstock <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>)—typically a primary goal where managers wish to control <italic>Phragmites</italic>. Removal by either mechanism also increases light availability that warms exposed soils. Such conditions enhance germination and recruitment of native plants from seed banks, which is critical for wetland recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C102">Marks <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C42">Farnsworth and Meyerson 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C1">Ailstock <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C81">Kiviat 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C24">Carlson <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>).Excavation provides complete <italic>Phragmites</italic> control, and is likely the only landscape-scale option for mechanical removal, but requires disproportionally greater costs in both time and resources. Land managers have successfully restored <italic>Phragmites</italic>-dominated dredge spoil sites to highly valued salt marshes in New England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C119">Moore <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). In such cases, excavation to elevations at or below mean high water (i.e. coupling removal with restoration of hydrology) results in daily tidal flooding, increased salinity and sulfide, and resulted in restoration of native plant communities and associated faunal species in Connecticut and New Hampshire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C119">Moore <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>).Response variables measured in reviewed studies. Functional vegetation represents only diversity, functional groups or species of interest, but not plant communities. Seedbank represents studies where germination trials were conducted.The most commonly used herbicides contain the active ingredient glyphosate; this is likely attributed to the fact that glyphosate herbicides were the only Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved herbicides for application in aquatic environments until 2003. Common trade names approved for aquatic application of glyphosate to control <italic>Phragmites</italic> include Rodeo™, GlyPro™ and Aqua Neat™. As a broad-spectrum systemic herbicide, glyphosate is non-selective and also kills non-target plants including woody and herbaceous plants. According to the Rodeo™ label, glyphosate is taken up through the plant epidermis and subsequently moves into the root system through the vascular tissue. In the plant, it interferes with amino acid synthesis specifically found in plants and microorganisms. Degradation of glyphosate is reported to occur through microbial pathways in &lt;7 days; however, greenhouse studies have reported the persistence of glyphosate or glyphosate-related products for up to 79 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C108">Meyerson <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>), suggesting that any subsequent replanting should occur several weeks after replanting dates given by the label instructions, due to potential negative effects on non-target native plants. A surfactant must be added to aid in foliar uptake, and reported toxicity in fauna has been attributed to surfactants in the various formulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C160">Tu <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>), and not the herbicide itself.Historically, glyphosate was applied at the end of the growing season (per label instructions) when plants were translocating resources to belowground rhizomes. Owing to the extremely long growing season of non-native <italic>Phragmites</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C188">Farnsworth and Meyerson 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C95">League <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>), it was possible to apply glyphosate after native plant senescence with minimal effect on native vegetation. Two recent studies have found that, contrary to label instructions, earlier application of glyphosate (June <italic>vs.</italic> September) is more effective at controlling <italic>Phragmites</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C37">Derr 2008<italic>b</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C123">Mozdzer <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). However, earlier application also has the potential to negatively impact native plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C123">Mozdzer <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>), which is often at odds with management goals.Herbicide concentrations (as percent solution of active ingredient in water) used by herbicide removal studies.The active ingredient imazapyr was approved in 2003 by the US EPA for application in wetland habitats labelled as Habitat™, Eagre™ and EcoImazapyr™. Since then, land managers have been using this herbicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C103">Marris 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C30">Clarke 2006</xref>) to control <italic>Phragmites</italic>. According to the label, imazapyr works by a mechanism targeting broad-chained plant-specific amino acids in meristematic regions, and is translocated belowground to kill rhizomes. Unlike glyphosate, imazapyr is taken up by the plants’ leaves as well as by its roots. In solution, imazapyr is broken down through photodegradation with an average half-life of 2 days. However, in soils where ultraviolet breakdown does not occur, microbial breakdown of imazapyr is the primary mechanism of degradation with half-lives ranging from 1 month to over 4 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C160">Tu <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>) with soil moisture, soil depth, pH and temperature affecting the rates of microbial degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C172">Vizantinopoulos and Lolos 1994</xref>). Toxicity is described as low to birds and mammals; however, non-ionic surfactants may have detrimental effects on invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C160">Tu <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>).Controlled comparative studies have found that imazapyr is more effective than glyphosate in controlling <italic>Phragmites</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C68">Kay 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C48">Getsinger <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C37">Derr 2008<italic>b</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C123">Mozdzer <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>), but not without serious negative consequences to native plants including recolonization following the death of <italic>Phragmites</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C123">Mozdzer <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). The only studies that reported glyphosate exhibiting a greater impact on <italic>Phragmites</italic> under field conditions were two that used higher concentrations than recommended by the manufacturer (30 % in study <italic>vs.</italic> &lt;6 % recommended) and were not comparable to the rate of imazapyr used (5 %) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C7">Back and Holomuzki 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C8">Back <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU001F4">4</xref>). Other studies have demonstrated that there is no need to use glyphosate in concentrations higher than those listed on the product label (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C29">Cheshier <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>), and label instructions should not be exceeded due to potential negative consequences on flora and fauna. Land managers have noted that wetlands are slower to recover when imazapyr is used when compared with glyphosate herbicides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C123">Mozdzer <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>), which may be attributed to greater persistence in the soil. Given the potential for non-selective root uptake of imazapyr by all plants, the presence of imazapyr or imazapyr residues may be affecting the seed banks of native plants. Research is critically needed to understand whether imazapyr has negative impacts on the seed bank, or if the delayed recovery can be attributed to the persistence of the herbicide in the soils impairing growth of seedlings.Few have investigated or attempted to control <italic>Phragmites</italic> at the landscape level, and even fewer have made the results available to the scientific community. Perhaps one of the largest restoration projects occurred on the Delaware River as part of the Public Service Electric and Gas restoration. Several papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C163">Turner and Warren 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C50">Gratton and Denno 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C154">Teal and Peterson 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C165">URS 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C78">Kimball and Able 2007</xref>) were published midway through the restoration process, reporting on the management approach, but the final results assessing if the management objectives to restore vegetatively diverse, functioning wetlands were achieved have never been published as a peer reviewed study.In Virginia, USA, land managers have established one of the most thorough management and coordination programmes that we are aware of by combining efforts with private, state and federal stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C127">Myers <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Partnering with numerous public and private entities, state staff targeted priority conservation areas (the coastal habitats of Virginia around Chesapeake Bay) to reduce the cover and rate of <italic>Phragmites</italic> spread. These efforts spanned 6 years and often included an initial aerial application that was followed by ground-based applications in subsequent years to control any re-sprouting. Most of the sites that were treated were surveyed by helicopters in 2004 and 2008. Given that the treatments and surveys were coordinated at the landscape level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C127">Myers <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>), the effort enabled land managers to share resources, resulting in one of the few examples of landscape-scale management and control.The coordinated work in Virginia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C127">Myers <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>) revealed several patterns, which provided insights for future management. In treated areas, land managers were able to reduce <italic>Phragmites</italic> abundance by 34 % from 706 acres to 468 acres. However, where aerial control was not applied, there was a 22 % increase in <italic>Phragmites</italic> abundance from 657 to 805 acres. Cumulatively over a 4-year period, <italic>Phragmites</italic> abundance was only reduced by 4 % total since management focused primarily on large stands (&gt;5 acres). However, during this same period, the small (&lt;0.25 acres) and medium (&gt;0.25 and &lt;5.0 acres) sized class populations increased in abundance by 22 and 87 %, respectively, accounting for almost all the gains in habitat from controlling the large stands. These findings suggest that targeting large stands may not be appropriate for controlling <italic>Phragmites</italic> at the landscape level. Instead, priority should be given to small patches that are likely to expand in the future and may contribute to future expansion by sexual reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C127">Myers <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>), which is an approach supported in general recommendations for invasive species control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C118">Moody and Mack 1988</xref>).Regardless of the herbicide used, one-time applications are never 100 % effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C72">Kettenring and Reinhardt Adams 2011</xref>). In order for a control and restoration programme to be successful, land managers must commit to multi-year applications (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C138">Riemer 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C68">Kay 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C174">Warren <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C29">Cheshier <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C100">Lombard <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>) in addition to a long-term commitment from land managers and stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C154">Teal and Peterson 2005</xref>).Plant competition by native plants can alter the restoration trajectory. Unmanaged areas where <italic>Phragmites</italic> has been controlled effectively, but not replanted with native species, are often reinvaded by <italic>Phragmites</italic> immediately either by seeds or regrowth from rhizomes that were not killed. The importance of <italic>Phragmites</italic> seed banks in reinvasion varies. Earlier studies reported that <italic>Phragmites</italic> was not present in the seed bank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C169">Van der Valk and Davis 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C185">Wilson <italic>et al.</italic> 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C9">Baldwin and DeRico 1999</xref>); however, more recent studies have found ample <italic>Phragmites</italic> seed in the seed bank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C149">Smith and Kadlec 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C177">Welling <italic>et al.</italic> 1988<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C178"><italic>b</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C96">Leck 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C10">Baldwin <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). As a grass, <italic>Phragmites</italic> seeds do not remain viable in the seed bank for very long. Where germination of <italic>Phragmites</italic> seeds has been reported, the density of the germinated seeds can be almost as high as the number of viable seeds produced (∼700 seeds m<sup>−2</sup>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C10">Baldwin <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). If this scenario is typical, it suggests that revegetation of areas from which <italic>Phragmites</italic> has been killed should be planted or seeded with native plants as soon as possible, under the theory that native plants will competitively exclude <italic>Phragmites</italic> seedlings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C42">Farnsworth and Meyerson 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C173">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C24">Carlson <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C22">Byun <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). Field experiments in tidal marshes have shown that native plants, though smaller, can slow the recolonization of <italic>Phragmites</italic> seedlings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C114">Minchinton 2002<italic>b</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C115">Minchinton and Bertness 2003</xref>) and reduce the success of resprouting from rhizomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C4">Amsberry <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C84">Konisky and Burdick 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C173">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C132">Peter and Burdick 2010</xref>).Greater species richness in resident plant communities may reduce the ability of <italic>Phragmites</italic> to colonize and expand. A wetland with intact vegetation will have fewer opportunities for <italic>Phragmites</italic> colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C70">Kennedy <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). The potential of native species to successfully compete with <italic>Phragmites</italic> was demonstrated in a field experiment in which one or four native species were planted with <italic>Phragmites</italic> shoots that were grown from rhizomes. Plots with greater species richness had the most dramatic effects, reducing <italic>Phragmites</italic> shoot density &gt;50 %, biomass &gt;90 % and survival &gt;65 % compared with unplanted controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C132">Peter and Burdick 2010</xref>). A Canadian competition study evaluated plant functional diversity as a factor in <italic>Phragmites</italic> competition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C22">Byun <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref> found that biotic resistance in plant communities increased by niche preemption (native plants germinated before <italic>Phragmites</italic> seeds) and niche partitioning (functional diversity). These two experiments demonstrate the importance of plant communities and post-control revegetation in resisting <italic>Phragmites</italic> invasion.Accelerated development or succession provides an alternative management strategy. This strategy can be successful where the vegetation of forested wetlands or upland edges of wetlands has been disturbed and replaced by <italic>Phragmites</italic>. Here, removal could be coupled with planting trees and shrubs to shade out <italic>Phragmites</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C81">Kiviat 2006</xref>; Geoff Wilson, Northeast Wetland Restoration, pers. comm<italic>.</italic>). A survey of <italic>Phragmites</italic> invasion of 15 created tidal wetlands found <italic>Phragmites</italic> stands decreased cover where shrub/scrub habitat developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C59">Havens <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>). This approach may prevent <italic>Phragmites</italic> reestablishment over the long term, or may allow only scattered <italic>Phragmites</italic> plants to survive.Native seed banks are critical for successful revegetation after <italic>Phragmites</italic> removal. The literature is full of conflicting results, but overall, wetlands tend to have diverse persistent seed banks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C98">Leck and Simpson 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C164">Ungar 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C96">Leck 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C97">Leck and Leck 2005</xref>) and seed bank studies have not resulted in any clear relationship between the diversity of species in the seed bank and <italic>Phragmites</italic> invasion. In a Great Lakes study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C24">Carlson <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)</xref> found that the diversity of vegetation after <italic>Phragmites</italic> removal depended upon the diversity of the native seed bank. It has also been shown that a diverse native seed bank can persist in monocultures of <italic>Phragmites</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C10">Baldwin <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). In fact, the diversity of herbaceous species in the seed bank has been found to be greater in stands dominated by <italic>Phragmites</italic> compared with surrounding areas dominated by native vegetation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C116">Minchinton <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). Minchinton and colleagues concluded that the high cover of <italic>Phragmites</italic> and the thick litter layer inhibited the germination of non-<italic>Phragmites</italic> seeds in the seed bank. In a tidal freshwater system, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C1">Ailstock <italic>et al.</italic> (2001)</xref> found that the seed bank under <italic>Phragmites</italic> and after <italic>Phragmites</italic> removal both had a high diversity of species. These authors concluded that the type of <italic>Phragmites</italic> management will alter the seed bank, with herbicide-burn treatments having a different seed bank species composition compared with herbicide alone which impacts the outcome of passive revegetation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C56">Hallinger and Shisler (2009)</xref> reported successful recolonization of native vegetation from the seed bank alone (with minor reseeding) in a New Jersey salt marsh following <italic>Phragmites</italic> removal. In New England, greater plant diversity was found in treated areas compared with both invaded and uninvaded controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C120">Moore <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). These studies indicate that the seed bank can play an important role in any wetland restoration effort following <italic>Phragmites</italic> removal.Grazing has long been used to manage <italic>Phragmites</italic> stands, primarily in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C102">Marks <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>), yet there are very few empirical studies evaluating grazing in North America (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C81">Kiviat 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C155">Tesauro and Ehrenfeld (2007)</xref> used grazing to manage <italic>Phragmites</italic> and other invasive species in a New Jersey wetland and found the method beneficial to plant species diversity and animal habitat, but the study lacked replication. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C19">Brundage (2010)</xref> showed that in Maryland, goats can significantly decrease <italic>Phragmites</italic> density, height and biomass while concurrently increasing species diversity in grazed plots. Around the Great Salt Lake in Utah, several agencies use grazing to manage <italic>Phragmites</italic>, primarily using cattle (49 % of surveyed land managers in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C76">Kettenring <italic>et al.</italic> 2012<italic>a</italic></xref>). Although there are no formal monitoring data available, wetlands in Utah that receive high-intensity, short-duration grazing appear to respond best, with <italic>Distichlis spicata</italic> replacing <italic>Phragmites</italic> after 3 years of grazing rotation (Rich Hansen, Utah Department of Wildlife Resources, pers. comm.), and increases in shorebirds and waterfowl as well (Chad Cranney, Utah Department of Wildlife Resources, pers. comm.). In contrast, a study that tested goat grazing in New Jersey marshes in low densities (∼1 goat per acre) found that goats preferentially ate all vegetation except <italic>Phragmites</italic>, only consuming <italic>Phragmites</italic> when all other options were exhausted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C154">Teal and Peterson 2005</xref>; John Teal, J. M. Teal Associates, pers. comm.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C165">URS 2005</xref>). Forced grazing in small plots, where grazing mammals do not have an alternative food source, can be successful in controlling <italic>Phragmites</italic> if applied appropriately (B. R. Silliman <italic>et al.</italic>, in review). However, there are obvious tradeoffs associated with high-intensity grazing, such as soil compaction, trampling and/or nutrient enrichment that may prevent it from being a suitable method in many areas. Diverse communities of natural herbivores also help suppress <italic>Phragmites</italic> expansion. Small mammals appear to decrease establishment of <italic>Phragmites</italic> in lower salinity tidal marshes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C47">Gedan <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Muskrats graze <italic>Phragmites</italic> in freshwater systems in the western United States (E.L.G.H., pers. observ.) and brackish wetlands (T.J.M., pers. observ.), indicating that natural herbivory will influence species assemblages in wetlands that contain <italic>Phragmites</italic>. Natural grazing by small mammals may be fostered in brackish marshes by providing muskrat platforms and enhancing habitat for natural herbivores (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C81">Kiviat 2006</xref>). Other natural herbivores seem deterred by <italic>Phragmites</italic> (<italic>Litorina irrorata</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C62">Hendricks <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). There is little information on how either natural herbivory or targeted grazing allow for the reassembly of native plant communities.Biocontrol organisms are currently highly prioritized by land management agencies as a low-cost management strategy alternative. Traditional biocontrol agents are insect herbivores found in the invasive plant's native range that can have strong impacts on its growth and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C159">Tscharntke 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C170">Van Driesche <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). Planned introductions of invertebrates are often controversial as there is a potential for unintended effects on non-target organisms or even across trophic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C158">Thomas and Reid 2007</xref>), with only 27 % of studies reporting complete success in eliminating invasive plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C170">Van Driesche <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). A recent survey of land managers found that 91 % would release biocontrol organisms for <italic>Phragmites</italic>, indicating that there is a strong desire for new techniques to control this grass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C104">Martin and Blossey 2013</xref>). Some land managers expressly prohibit the use of biocontrols due to the potential for unintended impacts and the risks to non-target organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C160">Tu <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). The search for a biocontrol for <italic>Phragmites</italic> in North America has been going on for over a decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C159">Tscharntke 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C156">Tewksbury <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C16">Blossey 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C55">Häfliger <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>), and several potential insect biocontrols have been identified and are currently undergoing host-specificity testing with potential releases in 2–3 years from time of writing (B. Blossey, Cornell University, pers. comm.).In the native range of Eurasian <italic>Phragmites</italic>, there are several dozen invertebrate herbivores in reed stands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C159">Tscharntke 1999</xref>) and many of the natural enemies are also found in North America (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C156">Tewksbury <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref> for a comprehensive review). Indeed, <italic>Phragmites</italic> herbivores are still being discovered in North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C38">Eichiner <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Several herbivores prefer native conspecific <italic>Phragmites</italic> to the non-native lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C91">Lambert <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>), findings that are troubling given the potential impacts on the widely distributed native <italic>Phragmites</italic> in North America. The herbivores currently present in North America are not considered effective at controlling the spread of the invasive form of <italic>Phragmites</italic>, though some can prevent flowering (e.g. <italic>Lipara</italic> spp<italic>.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C91">Lambert <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). An ongoing study in the Chesapeake Bay has found stem infection rates by insects of over 50 % (E. L. G. Hazelton <italic>et al.</italic>, in review), yet the degree of impact on competitive dominance and reproductive output is yet to be studied.Several new management methods are currently in development, ranging from hydrologic restoration to alteration of rhizosphere conditions, novel molecular tools and fungal pathogens. Multiple research groups are investigating pathogens as potential biocontrols. A group at Cornell University is looking at oomycetes as a potential <italic>Phragmites</italic> management tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C129">Nelson 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C147">Shearer and Harms (2012)</xref> attempted to isolate fungal pathogens that will preferentially attack non-native <italic>Phragmites</italic> in North America. In a converse approach, another group is using fungal inhibitors to eliminate endophytes in <italic>Phragmites</italic> and then assess reductions in performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C166">USGS Great Lakes Science Center 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C189">2013</xref>). Gene silencing techniques are in development with a goal of identifying knock out genes associated with <italic>Phragmites</italic> growth and photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C166">USGS Great Lakes Science Center 2012</xref>).In tidal wetlands, restoring hydrology often results in increased porewater sulfide shifting the competitive advantage to native vegetation over <italic>Phragmites</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C174">Warren <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C27">Chambers <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C120">Moore <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). High concentrations of sulfide impede nutrient uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C25">Chambers <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>) and also decrease <italic>Phragmites</italic> growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C64">Howes <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Observations of lower sulfide levels in tidal marsh soils with <italic>Phragmites</italic> stands suggest that high sulfide levels may limit <italic>Phragmites</italic> distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C25">Chambers <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C26">2002</xref>). Seeds, seedlings and cuttings can tolerate sulfide concentrations of up to ∼1.5 mM sulfide (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C27">Chambers <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>), but mature culms were able to survive consistent sulfide levels of 1.5 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C64">Howes <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). These findings suggest that mature stands with clonal connections may be tolerant of high sulfide concentrations. Therefore, hydrologic control might work best following mechanical actions to eliminate aboveground portions of mature shoots, preventing <italic>Phragmites</italic> from oxygenating the rhizosphere.Other invasive grasses have been successfully managed by nitrogen control including <italic>Bromus tectorum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C89">Kulmatiski and Beard 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C171">Vasquez <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>) and <italic>Phalaris arundinacea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C65">Ianone <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C171">Vasquez <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> found that more holistic management practices consisting of controlled grazing, microbial change (through carbon amendment) and native planting helped control nitrogen and make sites less invasible by <italic>B. tectorum</italic> in semi-arid systems. In other systems, addition of sawdust to promote microbial nitrogen immobilization, combined with planting diverse plant assemblages allowed native species to recover following management for <italic>P. arundinacea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C65">Ianone <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). Sawdust addition impacts non-native grasses more than non-native and native forbs and native grasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C2">Alpert and Maron 2000</xref>). Sugar amendment decreased the success of multiple invasive plants greater than adding activated charcoal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C117">Mitchell and Bakker 2011</xref>). Even carbon amendment will likely require watershed-scale restoration to permanently decrease plant-available nitrogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C131">Perry <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>) and future studies will need to determine the efficacy of such approaches on <italic>Phragmites</italic>.Based on this review, we see the need for more research that investigates comprehensive, landscape-scale, integrative management strategies. There is a clear bias in the literature to herbicide use and mowing or cutting, which is reflected in recent surveys of land managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C76">Kettenring <italic>et al.</italic> 2012<italic>a</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C104">Martin and Blossey 2013</xref>). These methods may be effective on a site-by-site basis, but they do not address the factors that contribute to <italic>Phragmites</italic> invasion. Whether the management goal is to eliminate <italic>Phragmites</italic> or merely reduce its dominance, control measures will be more successful if linked with establishment of native plants to occupy the site and periodic monitoring to identify, mark and treat invasive plants. Regardless of the control method and initial success of native plants, non-native <italic>Phragmites</italic> will recolonize in most cases (unless salinities are high, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C152">Sun <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>) and will be difficult to eliminate from invaded wetlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C42">Farnsworth and Meyerson 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C174">Warren <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>).Conceptual model of <italic>Phragmites</italic> spread. Intrinsic factors are shown in boxes; extrinsic factors are in ovals. Genet diversity has a positive effect on viable seed production due to increased out-crossing potential. There is a positive feedback between the intrinsic factors affecting sexual reproduction and spread that are further enhanced by physical disturbances and nutrients.<italic>Phragmites</italic> invasions were long thought to originate primarily from vegetative propagules (e.g. rhizomes) on the upland edge of wetlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C12">Bart <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>), despite the fact that <italic>Phragmites</italic> is capable of sexual reproduction and spread from seed.

Viable seeds will lead to the production of new clones, thereby increasing outcrossing potential in a positive feedback that is further enhanced by the presence of disturbances and nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C74">Kettenring <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C75">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C106">McCormick <italic>et al.</italic> 2010<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C107"><italic>b</italic></xref>). In particular, inflorescence size and seed quantity increase with elevated nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C75">Kettenring <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>), and <italic>Phragmites</italic> in watersheds with a greater degree of anthropogenic development produce more seeds than those with less human impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C79">King <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C73">Kettenring and Whigham 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C10">Baldwin <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C74">Kettenring <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C106">McCormick <italic>et al.</italic> 2010<italic>a</italic></xref>). <italic>Phragmites</italic> seedlings then can exhibit ‘explosive growth’ in response to elevated nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C144">Saltonstall and Stevenson 2007</xref>).<italic>Phragmites</italic> is a disturbance specialist and its seeds require light and large diurnal temperature fluctuation to break dormancy; conditions typically found on bare, non-inundated soils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C5">Armstrong <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C39">Ekstam and Foresby 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C40">Ekstam <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>).

Thus, older stands may decrease in management priority as their clonal diversity decreases. Hyper-adapted clones will be able to prevent seeding establishment by shading the underlying substrate. The outcome of these interactions is that a single clone may eventually competitively exclude other clones, potentially decreasing future sexual reproduction by decreasing outcrossing potential. Many of the oldest stands in Chesapeake Bay appear to have decreased their rate of spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C136">Rice <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>), perhaps as a wetland reaches carrying capacity.In addition to stand age effects on sexual reproduction, several obligate <italic>Phragmites</italic> endophagous herbivores eliminate <italic>Phragmites</italic> apical dominance, thus destroying flowering potential on attacked culms (e.g. <italic>Lipara</italic> spp., <italic>Giraudiella</italic> spp., <italic>Calamomyia</italic> spp., <italic>Lasioptera</italic> spp., <italic>Tetramesa</italic> spp. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C159">Tscharntke 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C156">Tewksbury <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C91">Lambert <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>).

In addition, addressing sexual reproduction as part of management efforts will be critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C75">Kettenring <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>), especially given that the common practice to control <italic>Phragmites</italic> in the fall with glyphosate often occurs after seeds have been produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C102">Marks <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C75">Kettenring <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>).Critiques of <italic>Phragmites</italic> management are not new, and some authors have called for revaluation of <italic>Phragmites</italic> and the tradeoffs associated with management. Several authors have demonstrated that non-native <italic>Phragmites</italic> provides valuable ecosystem services, especially in the context of increasing anthropogenic stressors and climate change. The services include providing resilient vegetation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C101">Ludwig <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>), accretion rates that can keep pace with sea level rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C141">Rooth <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>), habitat quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C111">Meyerson <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>), nutrient removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C124">Mozdzer <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>) and other ecosystem services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C140">Rooth and Windham 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C81">Kiviat 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C82">2013</xref> in this special issue; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C63">Hershner and Havens 2008</xref>). The potential ecosystem services provided by <italic>Phragmites</italic> must be weighed against the desired management outcomes (such as waterfowl management; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C33">Cross and Fleming 1989</xref>) associated with <italic>Phragmites</italic> removal. Since we still know little about the composition of vegetation communities after <italic>Phragmites</italic> is removed, we should weigh the costs of management heavily against the assumed benefits. <italic>Phragmites</italic> management has a great economic cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C104">Martin and Blossey 2013</xref>) and could be met with public backlash due to the use of herbicide and other cultural perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C154">Teal and Peterson 2005</xref>). It is unlikely that a single strategy will work at all sites; and all management actions should be conducted in a case-specific manner with considerations for the likelihood of success and the costs of management in each watershed.Managers may decide that certain landscapes have been altered too far from a natural state to successfully control <italic>Phragmites</italic> and have reached an alternate stable state that includes non-native <italic>Phragmites</italic> monocultures. Choosing to restore sites that are less degraded and facilitating native plant communities are critical steps toward successful management of invasive plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C135">Reid <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Research and land managers should focus on identifying and restoring sites that are likely to recover and remain <italic>Phragmites</italic> free (<italic>sensu</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C1">Ailstock <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C135">Reid <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Restoration efforts may not succeed at all unless they are conducted at the watershed scale in order to address the initial cause (or source) of the invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C130">Palmer 2009</xref>). Based on our model of <italic>Phragmites</italic> invasion, sites that are in low nutrient watersheds where physical anthropogenic disturbances are unlikely should resist invasion (also see discussion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C74">Kettenring <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). Large-scale comparative studies that manage <italic>Phragmites</italic> across multiple watersheds will help us determine the factors that contribute to success and failure in <italic>Phragmites</italic> restoration efforts (<italic>sensu</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C151">Suding 2011</xref>). Once established, <italic>Phragmites</italic> is difficult to remove; preventing invasion may be more efficient than control. <italic>Phragmites</italic> control programmes that focus on protection of non-invaded wetlands through prioritization will likely be more successful than those aiming to reduce or eliminate <italic>Phragmites</italic> in heavily invaded watersheds.The actual outcomes of <italic>Phragmites</italic> removal are still largely unclear. In perhaps the most comprehensive study to date, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C1">Ailstock <italic>et al.</italic> (2001)</xref> recommended site-specific management with clearly defined restoration objectives. Restoration and management efforts that remove an invasive species often do not result in colonization by desirable native species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C72">Kettenring and Reinhardt Adams 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C151">Suding 2011</xref>). Changes are temporary and do not necessarily lead to habitat improvement. We advocate increased research into the outcomes of <italic>Phragmites</italic> management, the efficacy of management strategies and preplanning to assess which sites to manage (i.e. tradeoffs between management efforts and potential gains). Research can be used to guide landscape-scale multi-year removals that are structured to allow monitoring and adaptive responses to address challenges and meet management outcomes. Programmes should also consider possible underlying causes for <italic>Phragmites</italic> invasion (shoreline buffers to prevent disturbance from development and excess nutrient inputs) and broadening partnerships between ecologists, managers and policy makers (<italic>sensu</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU001C151">Suding 2011</xref>) to manage <italic>Phragmites</italic> in a more holistic manner.This manuscript is the direct outcome of the ‘<italic>Phragmites australis</italic> in North America and Europe’ symposium at the 2011 meeting of the Society of Wetland Scientists and was sponsored by <italic>AoB PLANTS</italic>.
