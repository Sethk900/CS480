Biopriming in bean seedsThe incorporation of biological control organisms in seeds may help control pathogens and improve seedling performance. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of biopriming bean seeds with Trichoderma spp. and Bacillus subtilis using physiological conditioning, suspensions of biological structures and film coating techniques. Biopriming treatments with suspensions of biological structures were performed using the commercial products Agrotrich plus® and Rhizoliptus®. Water restriction was achieved using a PDA + Manitol (−0.7 MPa) medium for both Trichoderma spp. and Bacillus subtilis. Fifty disinfected bean seeds were placed in each petri dish. When the first radicle protrusion appeared in a seed, the other seeds were removed and dried in the laboratory environment for 48 h. Film coating was performed with the addition of the Color Seed® (150 mL kg−1) polymer to a treatment solution containing either the Trichoderma spp. or the Rhizoliptus product. Seeds were dried for 48 h in the laboratory. Seeds were covered and treated with one or both organisms. Biopriming with spore or bacterial cell suspensions promoted bean seedling growth, and the other techniques were not required to potentiate these benefits. Covering the primed bean seeds reduced seed quality. Both Trichoderma spp. and Bacillus subtilis promote bean seedling growth, benefitting the seedling even after it becomes independent of the seed reserves.
