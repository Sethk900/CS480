Soil respiration in a Mediterranean oak forest at different developmental stages after coppicing.To assess the variation of soil respiration at different forest stages we measured it in a coppiced oak (<em>Quercus cerris</em> L.) chronosequence in central Italy during two campaigns, spanning 2 successive years, in four stands at different stages of the rotation: 1 year (S1), 5 years (S5), 10 years (S10) and 17 years (S17) after coppicing. The contribution of the different components of soil respiration flux (aboveground litter, belowground decomposition soil organic matter and root respiration) was estimated by a paired comparison of manipulative experiments between the recently coppiced stand (S1) and mature stand (S17).
