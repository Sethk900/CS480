Revision of the Neotropical genus Achia champion (coleoptera: Curculionidae)The neotropical weevil genus Achia Champion is taxonomically revised. The genus is distributed from the State of San Luis Potosi in Mexico southward through Central America to southern Brasil. Sixteen species are recognized, 10 of which are described here for the first time. The following species are described as new: Achia ancile, Brazil; A. bondari, Brazil; A. crucifer, Brazil; A. fausti, Venezuela; A. gounellei, Brazil; A. hustachei, Brazil and Argentina; A. obesa, Brazil; A. scutellacuta, Mexico; A. serjaniae, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Mexico; and A. vesca, El Salvador. Achia strangulata is transferred from the genus Anthonomus. Lectotypes are designated for A. adusta Champion, A. rhombifera Champion and A. strangulata (Faust). Each of the sixteen species is described and keyed. Habitus photographs and illustrations of genitalia and other taxonomic characters are presented for most of the species.Distributions of the species are mapped. Little is known about the biology of members of the genus. Achia serjaniae develops in the fruit of Serjania schiedeana (Sapindaceae) but hosts have not been determined for the other species.
