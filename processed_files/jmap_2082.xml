Forest soil CO2 flux: uncovering the contribution and environmental responses of ectomycorrhizas.Forests play a critical role in the global carbon cycle, being considered an important and continuing carbon sink. However, the response of carbon sequestration in forests to global climate change remains a major uncertainty, with a particularly poor understanding of the origins and environmental responses of soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux. For example, despite their large biomass, the contribution of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi to forest soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux and responses to changes in environmental drivers has, to date, not been quantified in the field. Their activity is often simplistically included in the 'autotrophic' root respiration term. We set up a multiplexed continuous soil respiration measurement system in a young Lodgepole pine forest, using a mycorrhizal mesh collar design, to monitor the three main soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux components: root, extraradical mycorrhizal hyphal, and soil heterotrophic respiration.
