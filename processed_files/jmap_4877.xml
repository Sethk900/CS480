Population dynamics of tadpoles of Crossodactylus gaudichaudii (Anura: Hylodidae) in the Atlantic Rainforest of Ilha Grande, southeastern BrazilWe studied the temporal distribution of tadpoles of Crossodactylus gaudichaudii, and their relationship with rainfall, in a Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest area. There is no previous information about the population dynamics of tadpoles from this species. We sampled 60 m along streams between May 2002 and April 2005. Tadpoles in initial stages of development (up to stage 25) were present in all months of the year and represented 80.4% of those sampled. This indicates a continuous recruitment of new individuals in the aquatic environment. Tadpoles in final stages of development (stages 42–46) represented only 5% of those sampled, which may be the result of higher mortality in the early development stages. Body length of tadpoles varied among developmental stages and between seasons. Tadpole density was higher in the rainy season than in the dry season, and was significantly related to rainfall in the area.
