Soil nutrient supply modulates temperature-induction cues in mast-seeding grassesSynchronous and intermittent reproduction in long-lived plants, known as mast seeding, is induced by climatic cues, but the mechanism explaining variation in masting among neighboring but edaphically segregated species is unknown. Soil nutrients can enhance flowering, and thus, populations on nutrient-rich soils may require less-favorable growing temperatures to flower. We tested this hypothesis by predicting the probability of flowering in response to air temperature for five species of alpine Chionochloa grasses in South Island, New Zealand, over 37 years and relating our predictions to soil N supply (NH4+ + NO3âˆ’). Summer air temperatures better predicted flowering than spring air temperatures, which were correlated with soil N mineralization. Species on N-rich soils required lower mean temperatures to induce flowering and/or responded more consistently across a gradient of air temperatures, contributing to the higher probability of their tillers and tussocks flowering at low summer temperatures. Our results suggest that flowering primarily occurs in response to warm summer temperatures, but species on N-rich soils require less favorable growing conditions because they invest relatively less N in seeds. Thus, predicting masting requires a consideration of the interactions among climate, the internal resources of plants, and mineral nutrient uptake.
