Physical, chemical and micromorphological effects of nitrogen fertilizers on Chernozemic soilsThis study was conducted on a Black Chernozemic soil, under continuous bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.) hay production, in which subplots have been fertilized with urea, ammonium-based fertilizers and Ca (NO3)2 at an annual rate of 336 kg haâˆ’1 since 1979. Short-term use of N fertilizer at exceedingly high rates increased organic matter content but did not consistently improve surface soil microaggregation. Measurement of the water dispersibility of clay clearly indicated that, in addition to organic matter content, the cation balance of soil is an important parameter in soil microaggregation. Use of urea and ammonium-based fertilizers lowered the soil pH and caused changes in the balance between Al and basic cations, exchangeable and titratable acidity. The measured chemical effects caused changes in the microfabrics of the soils which were observed in thin sections. In the control, the soil fabric consisted of mullgranic and mullgranoidic units reflecting the close association between organic matter and clay under the influence of soil fauna. Acidification of the surface soil by ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulphate is observed to have caused a rearrangement of the granic units into larger units where the granic fabric was less discernible. Despite this, a change in the bulk density could not be measured. The clay fractions of soils fertilized with urea and Ca (NO3)2 were less dispersible than in the control. The surface soils from the urea and Ca (NO3)2-treated plots developed banded fragmic and porphyric fabrics.
