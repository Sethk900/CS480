This study provides new information on fruit ripening of Bursera, from a structural and phenological point of view, we show some development patterns that must be taken into account in future physiological, ecological and management studies.  The deterioration of seasonally tropical dry forests will stop with the implementation of management plans for this ecosystem. To develop these plans, we require information regarding aspects such as germination and the presence of ‘empty seeds’ of representative species—like, for example,  Bursera,  a genus with a high number of endemic species of the Mesoamerican Hotspot—that would enable us to propagate its species. The main purpose of this study is to describe the phenological and structural characteristics of fruits of 12  Bursera  species and provide useful data for future studies on germination and seed dispersal, and to acquire new and useful information to understand the phylogenetic relationships of the Burseraceae family.  We described the phenology of fruit ripening in 12 species of  Bursera.  Fruits were collected from the study sites in three different stages of development. The histochemical and anatomical characteristics of fruits of all species were described with the use of inclusion techniques and scanning microscopy.  There is a time gap between the development of the ovary and the development of the ovule in the 12 studied species. The exposed pseudoaril during the dispersion stage is an indicator of the seed's maturity and the fruit's viability. The  Bursera  fruit shows the same structural pattern as that of  Commiphora,  as well as many similarities with species of the Anacardiaceae family. All species develop parthenocarpic fruits that retain the structural characteristics of the immature fruits: soft tissues rich in nitrogen compounds and few chemical and physical defences. Insects were found mainly inside the parthenocarpic fruits in eight species of  Bursera .  The dispersion unit in  Bursera  consists of a seed, a lignified endocarp that protects the seed, and a pseudoaril that helps attract seed dispersers. The production of parthenocarpic fruits is energy saving; however, it is necessary to evaluate the potential benefits of this phenomenon.  Owing to the rapid deterioration of seasonally dry tropical forests ( Sánchez-Azofeifa and Portillo-Quintero 2011 ), we need to select native plant species that will help regenerate this habitat and stop its fragmentation. To do this, it is necessary to know the biology, the ecology, and the propagation and management systems of the new species ( Vázquez-Yanes  et al . 1999 ). The genus  Bursera  is a dominant element of the seasonally tropical dry forest, especially in the Mesoamerican Hotspot ( Myers  et al . 2000 ) and specifically in Mexico. There are 106 species of  Bursera , 80 of which are endemic to Mexico ( Becerra 2005 ;  Rzedowski  et al . 2005 ;  Becerra and Venable 2008 ). In spite of the richness, abundance and endemism of  Bursera , the different processes that contribute to the reproductive success of the species, such as dispersion, pollination, competition, herbivory and the sexual system, and the dependence or contribution of each of these factors to their population dynamics, are practically unknown ( Traveset 2002 ). The first step to understanding such a network of processes, and which constitutes the main purpose of this study, is to acquire knowledge of the  Bursera  fruit as the structure containing the dispersion unit. It will then be possible to develop further studies about germination, seed dispersal and, subsequently, recruitment and seedling survival.  According to descriptions by  Rzedowski  et al . (2004 ,  2005 ),  Bursera  seeds disperse through the ‘endozoochory syndrome’, which means that the seeds are protected against physical and chemical damage by a hard layer, their pulp is rich in nutrients and their colour contrasts with the colour of the surrounding vegetation ( Van der Pijl 1982 ;  Howe and Westley 1988 ). An obstacle for the propagation and management of  Bursera  has been the absence of information regarding its germination. The germination rate of the 12 studied species of  Bursera  was &lt;50 %, mainly due to the presence of ‘empty’ seeds. These results were attributed to the immaturity of the embryo and to genetic factors such as endogamy ( Andrés-Hernández and Espinosa-Organista 2002 ;  Bonfil-Sanders  et al . 2008 ). Two other species also showed the presence of ‘empty’ fruits ( Verdú and García-Fayos 1998 ;  Ramos-Ordoñez  et al . 2008 ). These ‘empty’ fruits or seeds have been interpreted as parthenocarpy (the production of seedless fruits) but, excluding  Bursera morelensis , the structural characteristics and the ecological role of seeded and seedless fruits remain unknown. Seed development in  B. morelensis  shows a time gap as regards the development of the ovary. The fertile ovule becomes latent for 7–11 months; the valves in these fruits are completely released, showing a brightly coloured pseudoaril ( Ramos-Ordoñez  et al . 2008 ). This same time gap was reported for  Bursera delpechiana  and  B. medranoana  ( Srivastava 1968 ;  Cortes 1998 ). Parthenocarpic fruits in  B. morelensis  are characterized by their development even in the absence of pollination, and abortion of the ovule is frequently caused by an abnormal growth of the ovary walls which ultimately crush the ovule. Regardless of the abortion of the ovule, the fruit continues its development, although as the stage of seed dispersal approaches, the fruit dries, the valves open partially, rarely falling off completely, and the fruit can remain on the tree even if the next flowering and fructification stages have started. During their development histologically, these fruits have fewer chemical and physical defences than those with seeds ( Ramos-Ordoñez  et al . 2008 ). The same research with  B. morelensis  suggests that abortion of the ovule can also be caused by insects; these seeds can be recognized by the holes left by the insects when they deposit their eggs or when they abandon the fruit.  Bonfil-Sanders  et al . (2008)  also mention the presence of ‘empty’ seeds, deformed and with holes, although they do not refer to their possible origin. Considering that seeds develop from ovules and that, when mature, they have embryos, endosperm (in most cases) and testa ( Esau 1985 ), the use of the term ‘empty seed’ in the literature is contradictory. The anatomical description of the  Bursera  fruit, absent in the literature, can contribute to understanding the arrangement of different layers of the pericarp, and to define the composition of the dispersal unit. It can also help to better understand the phylogenetic relationships with other members of the Burseraceae family which, for a long time, have been based on the morphological characteristics of the fruit ( Becerra 2003 ;  Daly  et al . 2011 ), and with members of the Anacardiaceae family, to which it is strongly related ( Wannan and Quinn 1990 ;  Bachelier and Endress 2009 ).  Accordingly, the particular objectives of this study were (i) to describe the phenological characteristics of 12 species of  Bursera  with regard to the production and maturation of the fruit; (ii) to determine whether the fruit of  Bursera  with seeds has the same structural pattern, by using 12 species that represent the six groups comprising the genus according to  Becerra (2003) ; (iii) to establish whether the ‘empty’ fruits' are parthenocarpic, and to assess their physical and chemical defenses from a histochemical and anatomical perspective; (iv) to determine whether the time lag between the development of the ovule and the development of the ovary is a common phenomenon in the 12 species; and (v) to determine whether the fruits of the 12 species are inhabited by insects, linking their presence to the phenological and structural characteristics of the fruits.  Morphological characteristics of the fruit in 12  Bursera  species and sampling site; nine of them are endemic to Mexico ( a ). Fruit form; number of valves of the fruit; number of locules in the ovary. Gathered information from  Rzedowski  et al . (2004 ,  2005 ) and  Guízar-Nolazco and Sánchez-Vélez (1991) .  Characteristics of the study sites. Information obtained from  Férnández (1999) ,  Medina (2000) ,  Gómez-Garzón (2002)  and  Ceccon and Hernández (2009) .  The phenology of the species was described after six visits to the study sites (2010: February, May, mid-June, end of July and early December; 2011: May 2011). The production periods of leaves, flowers and fruits of female individuals per species ( n  = 324, minimum 10 trees, maximum 40 trees) were registered after qualitative observations. Species from the state of Puebla had been checked previously (May 2005 to May 2007) ( Ramos-Ordoñez  et al . 2008 ). The flowering period of the species from the state of Morelos was determined after a literature search. The qualitative record of the reproductive period in which the trees were found was obtained during the first two visits. The approximate dates of the rainy season, the approximate amount of fruits produced by the trees and phenological periods were obtained through consultation with the inhabitants of the local community. The species were identified with the help of the literature ( Guízar-Nolazco and Sánchez-Vélez 1991 ;  Rzedowski  et al . 2004 ) and local guides. The individuals in places that were difficult to access, or those that were too high up, were viewed through binoculars. The species with fruits— B. aptera ,  B. arida ,  B. fagaroides  and  B. schlechtendalii —were identified and marked from the beginning (February) by the characteristics of the trunk and the presence of fruits. The rest of the species were identified and marked once the flowers and leaves had developed (June).  Three fruit collecting stages were established during the fruiting season 2010–2011: the initial stage of development or when fruit set occurs, a middle stage that considered the latency period of the ovule and the final stage when seed dispersal occurs. The middle stage was defined as the period after the fruit set stage and before dispersal. The four species with fruits in February and May had a middle stage in December. According to the literature and people from the local community, fruit removal in other species began in October and ended in December, so the middle stage was established at late July.  Collections were made in three trees of each species chosen at random in order to determine the structural characteristics of fruits with seeds and of ‘empty’ fruits, as well as the developmental stage of the ovule with regard to the stage of maturation in which the fruit was found. The same trees were used in every collection; we collected 50 fruits per tree, they were fixed with FAA (formol, acetic acid, 96 % ethanol and water 1 : 0.5 : 5 : 3.5) and taken to the laboratory. All fruits were dissected under a stereoscopic microscope and grouped in three different categories after registering the proportion of fruits with ovules or developing embryos, and fruits with an aborted ovule, occupied or not by insects. The occupied fruits were those with insects in any stage of development, or those that had oviposition marks or exit holes. Three samples per category were chosen randomly, embedded in paraffin and slices between 6 and 8 µm cut with a microtome. Approximately 700 glass slides were stained with safranin–fast green in order to describe their characteristics. Five hundred and forty glass slides and different staining methods were used to reveal the presence of starch (Lugol test), tannins (Vanillin test), cutin and suberin (oil red O), lignin (phloroglucinol-HCl) and insoluble polysaccharides and proteins (naphthol black blue-periodic acid-Schiff reagent). A second group of samples was chosen and dried to a critical point, coated with gold and observed under a scanning electron microscope (SEM). All techniques were carried out according to  López  et al . (2005) .  The stained glass slides were observed under a light microscope and a photographic record was created for all the results. Photographs were taken under an optical microscope (Olympus Provis AX70, Tokyo, Japan), a scanning microscope (JEOL Model JSM-5310LV, Tokyo, Japan; magnification 15× to 200 000×), and a stereoscopic microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Additionally, during the seed dispersal period, we collected from the trees ( n  = 30 fruits per species) fruits with an exposed pseudoaril as well as dry fruits, in order to describe their external characteristics.  Phenological characteristics of 12 species of  Bursera.  Group A includes  B. bicolor, B. biflora, B. bipinnata, B. copallifera, B. glabrifolia, B. grandifolia, B. lancifolia  and  B. submoniliformis.  Group B includes  B. aptera ,  B. arida ,  B. fagaroides  and  B. schlechtendalii.  Species checked at the end of the 2009–2010 fruiting season and during the season 2010–2011. The leaf, flower and fruit production periods, and the number of individuals per species ( n  = 324, minimum 10, maximum 40 trees) were qualitatively recorded. Species were identified with the help of the literature ( Guízar-Nolazco and Sánchez-Vélez 1991 ;  Rzedowski  et al.  2004 ) and local guides.   Cross-sections of the bilocular ovary of  B. submoniliformis  (A), and a trilocular ovary of  B. aptera  (B), with a fertile ovule and the placental sept that divides the locule.  Scale = 200 μm. fo, fertile ovule; lo, locule; se, septum; fu, funicule ovule. Fruits were collected during the initial stage of development ( n  = 50 fruits per three trees per species) and fixed with FAA. Fruits were dissected and grouped into three categories (fruits with ovule or embryo in development; fruits with aborted ovules, occupied by insects; and fruits with aborted ovules, unoccupied). Photographs were taken with bright-field illumination.  The characteristic of dry fruits is the absence of an embryo. The remains of an aborted ovule and/or endocarp malformations were found inside these dry fruits. At least one of the valves remains strongly attached to the rest of the fruit. Immature fruits with all the ovules aborted were seen during the three stages of development. These fruits were undetectable at first sight as they show the same morphological characteristics as immature fruits with a developing embryo.

Abbreviations: enp, proliferation of endocarp; lo, locule; fo, fertile ovule; io infertile ovule; me, mesocarp; ps, pseudoaril; en, endocarp; l-en, lignified endocarp. Fruits were collected during the initial and intermediate stages of development ( n  = 50 fruits per three trees per species), and fixed with FAA. Fruits were dissected and grouped into three categories (fruits with ovule or embryo in development, and fruits with aborted ovule, occupied, or not, by insects). For the lignin test in (C) and (D), we used phloroglucinol-HCl previously deparaffinated with gradual ethanols ( López  et al . 2005 ). Photographs were taken with bright-field illumination in (A), (C), (E) and (F); photographs of scanning microscopy (15× to 200 000×) in (B) and (D).  Tannins were found in all of the species, their distribution and amount varied in relation to the species and the age of the fruit. These are produced during the latency stage of the fruit, mainly in the subepidermis, the external mesocarp and the ovule, and persist during the dispersal stage. Species in Group B had more tannins than those in Group A. This difference was also seen among the types of fruits produced, as the parthenocarpic fruits had much less tannins than those with seeds. In fact, no tannins were found in parthenocarpic fruits of  B. aptera . The apparent latency of the ovule is interrupted and it is possible to see embryos in the first stages of development; this was seen mainly during the dispersal stage in fruits that were still indehiscent but whose colouration indicated they were near maturation, i.e. when the green exocarp started acquiring a reddish (in most species), purple (in  B. fagaroides ) or orange–yellow (in  B. aptera ) colouration. During the same stage, fruits in Group B had an abnormally developed endocarp and an ovule with not enough space to develop after its activity had re-initiated. These results indicate that fruits of all species develop while the ovule remains in an apparent state of latency.  Average percentage of parthenocarpic fruits with/without insects recorded during the initial, intermediate and final development stages. Species were arranged by group, and the percentage of parthenocarpic fruits without insects during the initial stage. Fruits were collected and fixed in FAA ( n  = 50 fruits per tree per species per stage). Collection took place during the 2010–2011 fructification season.   Fruits of  Bursera  occupied by insects (arrowheads).  (A) Fruit of  B. aptera  with two pairs of aborted ovules (arrows), indicating an abortion during the very early stages of development. (B) Fruit of  B. aptera  with the locule full of tissue and an adult wasp in its interior. (C) Fruit of  B. bipinnata  with a pupa of a beetle; the line indicates the width of the cocoon. Scale = 1 mm. Fruits were collected during the initial stage ( B. bipinnata ) and final stage of development ( B. aptera ,  n  = 50 fruits per three trees). Fruits were dried to a critical point and covered with gold, SEM photographs.  The average number of occupied fruits was below or the same as the proportion of unoccupied fruits in the three stages (Table  5 ). In species of Group A (except  B. glabrifolia ), occupation was higher during the initial stage, while species in Group B had more insects towards the dispersion stage. In  B. schlechtendalii , a wasp larva was found during the intermediate stage. This larva was in a state of decomposition in the mesocarp; the ovule and the lignified endocarp looked undamaged. This phenomenon was also seen in  B. bipinnata  during the dispersal stage, a fact which suggests that the lignified endocarp is one of the strongest defenses against insects.  The phenology of the studied species was very similar to that of  B. morelensis  and other species of trees typical of dry seasonal tropical forests ( Bullock and Solís-Magallanes 1990 ;  Borchert  et al . 2004 ;  Ramos-Ordoñez  et al . 2008 ). The development of the fruit showed the same pattern described for  B. morelensis  and  Canarium oleosum  ( Wannan and Quinn 1990 ;  Ramos-Ordoñez  et al . 2008 ), in which only the locule that will contain the seed develops. The results suggest that the lack of synchronicity between the development of the ovary and the development of the seed is another characteristic of the genus  Bursera , as this takes place in the 12 studied species, besides  B. delpechiana, B. medranoana  and  B. morelensis  ( Srivastava 1968 ;  Cortes 1998 ;  Ramos-Ordoñez  et al . 2008 ).  The structure and differentiation of the pericarp of  Bursera  show an immense similarity to those of the genus  Commiphora  published by  Van der Walt (1975) , suggesting a morphologic sinapomorphy. Nevertheless, ontogenetic studies are necessary to demonstrate this ( Thulin  et al . 2008 ;  Daly  et al . 2011 ). The resiniferous canals associated with the vascular bundles in the external mesocarp are a characteristic shared by the 12 species and by  Canarium oleosum  ( Wannan and Quinn 1990 ). The endocarp with sclereids is also a characteristic of  C. oleosum , Spondiadoideae and Anacardioideae (Anacardiaceae), supporting  Wannan and Quinn (1990) , who suggested that it is a plesiomorphic characteristic in the Anacardiaceae family.  From a structural point of view, the viable and parthenocarpic fruits of  Bursera  are similar, as is the case with  Schinopsis balansae  (Anacardiaceae) ( González and Vesprini 2010 ). Nevertheless, the difference with our study lies in the observation that the parthenocarpic fruits keep the characteristics of the immature fruits, such as the soft tissue with a high availability of nitrogen compounds, and a limited production of secondary metabolites.  According to  Dickie and Stuppy (2003) , besides its mechanical purpose, the seed cover, or a part of it, can develop structures that will help dispersion, such as a brightly coloured pulp (aril) that will attract dispersers. Results indicate that the protective role of the testa has been transferred to the endocarp, like in Anacardiaceae ( Corner 1976 ;  Wannan and Quinn 1990 ), and the attractive tissue is the pseudoaril, thus named because it is part of the fruit and not of the seed ( Font-Quer 1953 ). As a consequence, the unit of dispersion of the species studied consists of the seed, the endocarp and the pseudoaril or internal mesocarp. No external differences between the immature viable fruits and the immature perthenocarpic fruits were found. Nevertheless, the data indicate that the exposed pseudoaril is a sign of maturity of the seed, as suggested by  Andrés-Hernández and Espinosa-Organista (2002) , apart from being a characteristic of the viability of the fruit, like in  B. morelensis  ( Ramos-Ordoñez  et al . 2008 ;  Ramos-Ordoñez and Arizmendi 2011 ).   Bursera glabrifolia  provided an interesting piece of information: two-thirds of its pseudoaril, sometimes all of it, covering the pyrene, the same as in the Copallifera group in which  B. submoniliformis ,  B. bipinnata ,  B. bicolor  and  B. copallifera  are found ( Becerra 2003 ). Molecular phylogeny assembles  B. glabrifolia  with  B. biflora , and other species, in the Glabrifolia group, in which less than two-thirds of the pyrene is covered by the pseudoaril ( Becerra 2003 ).  Toledo (1982)  included the pseudoaril as a taxonomic character in a study of the species in the state of Guerrero, México; thus, in this context, it would be useful to do a revision of the morphological characteristics that fit the most recent results on the phylogeny of the genus ( De-Nova  et al . 2012 ).  Results show that parthenocarpy might be a common phenomenon in  Bursera  and can take place during any stage of development, as has been suggested by  Ramos-Ordoñez  et al . (2008)  and  Srivastava (1968) . It is also possible that parthenocarpy is a plesiomorphic character present in a common ancestor of both the Burseraceae and the Anacardiaceae families, selected for an unknown reason, and that has remained thus to this day ( Verdú and García-Fayos 1998 ;  Ramos-Ordoñez  et al . 2008 ). The abortion of the ovule and the absence of tissue in the locule seen in species with short ripening or maturation periods are very similar to those of  Pistacia lentiscus , another parthenocarpic species of the Anacardiaceae family in which fruits with remains of the funicule or of aborted embryo have been reported ( Jordano 1988 ). The abnormal development of the pericarp, common in species with longer periods of maturation or ripening, coincides with what has been described for  B. morelensis  ( Ramos-Ordoñez  et al.  2008 ). This phenomenon is well known in artificially manipulated crops such as citrus plants. Parthenocarpy could therefore be related to a hormonal imbalance, as is the case with such crops ( Gillaspy  et al . 1993 ;  Varoquaux  et al . 2000 ).  The presence of insects in the fruits seems to be related to diminished physical and chemical defenses as well as to nutrient availability; both of these factors are also influenced by the period of time the fruits take before they mature. The tannins, lignin and calcium oxalate crystals are known to reduce the palatability of the tissues, inhibit the digestion of carbohydrates, reduce the growth rate of many insects and harden plant tissues ( Franceschi and Horner 1980 ;  Rosenthal and Berenbaum 1991 ;  Weeb 1999 ;  Molano-Flores 2001 ;  Strauss and Zangerl 2002 ). For many plant species, therefore, predation of fruits and/or seeds by insects is related to scarce chemical and physical defenses ( Zangerl  et al . 1991 ;  Hulme and Benkman 2002 ). In addition, species that retain their fruits for long periods of time have more defences than those species with short maturation periods ( Stiles 1980 ). All this would explain why more insects were found during the first stages of development and in parthenocarpic fruits. It also explains the variation found in the production of secondary metabolites between the initial stage and the intermediate stage, and why the species of Group A had less tannins those in Group B.  Those insects that did not trespass into the lignified endocarp have already been described in another study on  B. morelensis  ( Barranco-Salazar 2011 ). In that study, the endocarp moved inwards, reducing the locule, which had the embryo with no indications of abortion. The space left by the movement was occupied by a larva that fed on the mesocarp. This suggests that the lignified endocarp of  Bursera  is the best, and maybe the last, defence against insect predation during the development of the embryo.  Because of the scarce information on Neo Tropical phytofagous entomofauna (V. Hernández-Ortiz, Instituto de Ecología A.C. México, pers. commun.), as well as the small number of specimens obtained, we can only speculate on the possible interactions of the insects found. The superfamily Chalcidoidea is characterized for grouping a large number of parasitoid insects ( Gencer 2004 ). Nevertheless, in this and other studies on  Bursera  ( Ramos-Ordoñez  et al . 2008 ;  Barranco-Salazar 2011 ), no evidence has been found on wasps as parasites of another insect inside the fruit. There is the possibility that, when they do not find their primary food, the parasitoid eats other resources ( Fletcher  et al . 1994 ) such as the embryo and/or pericarp of  Bursera  ( Barranco-Salazar 2011 ). The availability of nitrogenated compounds in immature and parthenocarpic fruits of  Bursera  could mean they are a food resource for the larvae until they become adults ( Saiz  et al . 1987 ). This result could also explain why granivorous birds eat parthenocarpic fruits of  B. morelensis  ( Ramos-Ordoñez and Arizmendi 2011 ), as the removal of these fruits coincides with the reproductive stage of the birds, just when the protein demand is high ( Ramos-Ordoñez 2009 ;  Barranco-Salazar 2011 ).  The results do not enable us to determine whether seed predation by insects is reduced by the production of parthenocarpic fruits, as is the case with other plants ( Coetzee and Giliomee 1987 ;  Zangerl  et al . 1991 ;  Traveset 1993 ;  Ziv and Bronstein 1996 ;  Verdú and García-Fayos 2001 ;  Ramos-Ordoñez  et al . 2008 ). We suggest a detailed monitoring to determine the time intervals in the development, as well as enlarging the fruit sample, as our sample (50 fruits per three trees per species) is small if one considers that individual trees can produce harvests that range from a few hundred to several thousand fruits ( Ramos-Ordoñez  et al . 2010 ), and that populations can be very abundant. In species of Group A, in particular, it is necessary to carry out experiments that exclude the insects, in order to determine the real proportion of parthenocarpic fruits produced and occupied.  Birds feeding on fruits were seen in both study sites, suggesting there is a plant–bird interaction. It is important to examine whether this interaction plays an important role in the reproduction of the different species, as has previously been seen in  B. morelensis , as well as the effect of endozoochory in germination, and of parthenocarpy in the removal of fruits ( Ramos-Ordoñez 2009 ;  Barranco-Salazar 2011 ;  Ramos-Ordoñez and Arizmendi 2011 ). It is also important to determine whether the presence of insects in the fruits has negative effects in dispersion by frugivorous animals ( Jordano 1987 ;  Garcia  et al . 1999 ). In spite of being adapted for dispersion by birds, many seeds fall to the ground (barochory), increasing the possibility of secondary dispersion as another important mechanism by which the seeds are taken to favourable sites for their germination. It is necessary to determine which animal species participate in this process, and what their contribution is in the establishment of the seedlings, a key process in dry tropical seasonal forests ( Verdú and Valiente-Banuet 2008 ). This information will help us to understand the intricate web of processes that are needed to sustain a plant community, and will contribute to ecological restoration plans, as is the case with other species ( Fink  et al . 2009 ;  Heleno  et al . 2010 ;  Howe  et al . 2010 ).  The anatomical description of the fruit helps one to better understand the phylogenetic relationship between the Burseraceae and the Anacardiaceae families, while the phenological characteristics of the maturation process constitute a useful tool in future studies of ecological aspects such as germination and seed dispersal. The presence of insects in fruits of eight of the 12 species seems to be related to the structural characteristics of immature and parthenocarpic fruits. Nevertheless, a more detailed analysis of this interaction is necessary. Parthenocarpy is represented in the two sections into which the genus  Bursera  is divided; production of seedless fruits is energy saving for the plant because, on the one hand, it takes place during the early stages of development and, on the other, the production of defence structures and compounds stops. In this context, we need further studies that will determine the ecological role of these fruits and their impact on the reproductive success of the species.
