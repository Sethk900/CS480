MECHANISMS OF CARBON AND NUTRIENT RELEASE AND RETENTION IN BEECH FOREST GAPS .3. ENVIRONMENTAL-REGULATION OF SOIL RESPIRATION AND NITROUS-OXIDE EMISSIONS ALONG A MICROCLIMATIC GRADIENTFluxes of CO2 and N2O were measured along a microclimatic gradient stretching from the centre of a gap into a mature beech stand using an automated chamber method. Simultaneously the regulating factors like soil water tensions, soil temperatures, nitrate concentrations were measured along the gradient. The daily mean values of the fluxes of CO2 and N2O were divided into classes of temperature and furthermore subdivided into classes of soil water tension to assess the significance of each regulating factor. Soil respiration at the centre of the gap was 40% lower compared to the rooted mature stand. The difference was explained by root respiration. At both sites soil respiration was primarily controlled by the soil temperature with an average Q(10) value of 2.3 over the different classes of temperature and soil water tension. Soil water tension reduced the soil respiration by up to 20% only by soil water tension above 400-600 hPa at the mature stand. The formation of N2O was reduced when the soil temperature was below 10 degrees C or the soil water tension exceeded 200 hPa. Therefore the N2O emission was 6 times higher at the unrooted centre of the gap due to the high moisture content in the growing season. Higher nitrate concentration doubled the N2O emission at the unrooted edge of the canopy and resulted in losses of 6.4 kg N ha(-1) within six months. Above 10 degrees C and below 200 hPa the N2O emission depended strongly upon the temperature with varying Q(10) values over the different classes of temperature and soil water tension. High Q(10) values up to 14.4 have been calculated below 14 degrees C and were explained by several processes with synergetic effects.
