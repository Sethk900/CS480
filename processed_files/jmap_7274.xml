Growth dynamics in a natural population of Corbicula fluminea (Bivalvia Sphaeriacea) at Punta Atalaya, Rio de La Plata, ArgentinaAnnual growth of Corbicula fluminea has been estimated by following the shift in sizeâ€frequency peaks based upon shell lengths. Normal curves were fitted to mean shell length for each generation, or age group. The study was based upon monthly and bimonthly samples taken from an natural population at Punta Atalaya, Rio de La Plata, Argentina, colonized in September 1982. The ageâ€length relationship was determined using the Von Bertalanffy's equation. The growth of C. fluminea slows markedly during the fallâ€winter period, April to August. Theoretical growth curves were calculated for springâ€summer and fallâ€winter seasons; the equations corresponding to each seasonal growth rate are respectively: Growth rate diminishes with increasing shellâ€length and age. Water temperature seems to be a determining factor for the occurrence of differential seasonal growth rates. Reproduction in C. fluminea occurs once a year at Punta Atalaya, and settlement of juveniles takes place in September. The estimated life span has been calculated to be 36 months.
