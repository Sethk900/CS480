Ecological analysis of mound formation of the Mima type in RÃ­o Quinto, Province of Cordoba, ArgentinaIn some areas of Argentine certain â€œmoundsâ€; of the Mima type are found. They are similar to other such features of landscapes which are known from North America and Eastern Africa e.g. Their appearance has been linked with burrowing activities of small mammals. In Argentine it is the activity of Ctenomys (conferctus) azarae which predominantly give rise to the Mima mounds. They are rapidly invaded by Cynodon dactylon plants which stabilize them. Formation of a Mima mound may take about 16 years, and the Ctenomys rodents remove in that period a total of about 8 300 tons of soil or 5 544 cubic metres per hectare, thereby influencing greatly the ecological pattern of the Mima landscape.
