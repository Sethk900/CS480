Range use of a Eurasian black vulture (Aegypius monachus) population in the Dadiaâ€Lefkimiâ€Soufli National Park and the adjacent areas, Thrace, NE GreecePrimary goal of this study was to facilitate the management and conservation of Eurasian black vulture (Aegypius monachus) population on a larger scale than the Dadiaâ€Lefkimiâ€Soufli National Park (Dadia NP). Range use pattern of this population was studied using an integrated radioâ€tracking methodology. Various home range (HR) parameters were estimated for the breeding (BS) and nonâ€breeding (NBS) season using minimum convex polygon and fixed kernel estimators and incremental cluster polygon analysis. Various comparisons were made within and between the two seasons and between the different age classes. More activity centres were detected during the BS than the NBS. The overall area used by the vultures was bigger in the NBS than in the BS and the adult individuals used HRs and core areas larger in size than the juveniles. During their foraging the vultures prospected a much wider area than Dadia NP and all showed fidelity to the colony while the juvenile individuals were attached to the natal area. The vultures' foraging behaviour has not been affected by supplementary feeding. Measures have to be taken to preserve the foraging areas that were identified and to prevent rural depopulation and the abandonment of traditional stockâ€raising practices.
