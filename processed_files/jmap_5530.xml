Three new endogean species of Laparocerus Schönherr, 1834 from the Canary Islands (Coleoptera, Curculionidae)Three new species of the weevil genus Laparocerus Schönherr (1834) adapted to the edaphic environment of the Canary Islands are described: L. edaphicus n. sp., L. oromii n. sp. and L. lopezi n. sp. They live in the humid laurel forests of Tenerife (Anaga Mountains), La Gomera (Garajonay National Park) and Gran Canaria (Valsendero), respectively. The small size and somewhat tubular body shape is a common character among them, as is the reduction of the eyes, which are totally absent in L. oromii n. sp. Despite these common adaptive traits, the three species seem not to be directly related. A key for the identification of all the known cryptozoic (edaphic and troglobitic) species of Laparocerus is provided.
