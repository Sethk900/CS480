The Myth of Desertification at China's Northwestern Frontier: The Case of Ningxia Province, 1929-1958In imperial China, government action to rangeland at the north-western frontier was for centuries determined by defense and what can be called â€œturning waste into use.â€ For the pacification of the region beyond the Great Wall, which frequently suffered from incursions by nomadic tribes, military colonies were established to reclaim land. The empire also set up Horse Pasturage Directorates (Mujian) under the auspices of the Imperial Stud (Taipusi) to ensure a steady provision of horses for military use. In contrast with the spatial perception of nomadic peoples, who valued the vast and open steppe, sedentary Han Chinese abhorred barren land that produced no grain. In their view, rangeland was no more than â€œwastelandâ€ (huangdi) that needed to be reclaimed and cultivated. The garrisons of the Great Wall contributed to this purpose.
