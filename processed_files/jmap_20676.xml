Northern Eurasia Earth Science Partnership Initiative: evolution of scientific investigations to applicable scienceThe letters collected in this focus issue of Environmental Research Letters on 'Environmental, socio-economic and climatic changes in Northern Eurasia and their feedbacks to the global Earth system' represent the third special issue based on the results of research within the Northern Eurasia Earth Science Partnership Initiative (NEESPI: http://neespi.org) program domain. Through the years, NEESPI researchers have presented a diverse array of articles that represent a variety of spatial scales and demonstrate the degree to which abrupt climatic and socio-economic changes are acting across Northern Eurasia and feed back to the global Earth system.
