Review of sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus L. 1758) (Actinopterygii: Acipenseridae) feeding  habits in the River Danube, 1694–852 river kmThe aim of this work is to present the variation in the sterlet’s (Acipenser ruthenus L. 1758) diet along the course of the River Danube, from 1694 to 852 river km. The diet of sterlet mostly comprised 12 bottom fauna taxa. Sterlet in the Danube feed mainly on larvae of Trichoptera, Chironomidae (Diptera) and Gammaridae (Amphipoda), with a reduction in food composition variability close to the Djerdap I dam and in the reservoir between the two dams. The other components of the diet were Corophium sp., Asselus sp., Mollusca, Oligochaeta, Annelida, Insecta, Nematoda and Hirudinea. The organisms typical of lithorheophilic and psammorheophilic biocoenoses play a considerable role in the diet of the sterlet. Composition of bottom fauna as food items varies due to changes in environmental conditions induced mainly by the construction of two dams: Djerdap I (943 river km, 1970) and Djerdap II (863 river km, 1984).
