The first finding of (TTAGG) n telomeric repeat in chromosomes of true bugs (Heteroptera, Belostomatidae)Using the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), the presence of (TTAGG)n telomeric sequence was detected in the chromosomes of Lethocerus patruelis (Stål, 1854) belonging to the family Belostomatidae (Heteroptera: Nepomorpha). This sequence was exclusively present at the ends of chromosomes in this species. This is the first evidence of the insect-type TTAGG telomeric repeats in Heteroptera.
