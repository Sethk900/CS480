Human impact on avian diversity in rural Mediterranean areasHuman activities influence the biodiversity of Mediterranean ecosystems and are involved in the transformation of natural habitats into farmland. We surveyed birds using the point count method on 288 plots at a 50-m radius in three altitudinal landscapes with different rural character in spring and autumn. The results showed that bird species richness in the study area was high (74 species). High total species richness was found in the upland rural landscape characterized by mixed land use and high landscape diversity. The applied richness of total, resident and Sylviidae species illustrated a definite preference for villages with a low human population during the breeding season. Positive and significant correlations were found between rural settlements and Fringillidae, Sylviidae and total bird richness at both periods in the three landscapes. Finally, a clear dependence on the land use/land cover type was shown for the five recorded priority species.
