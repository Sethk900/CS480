The effects of various seed treatments on the germination, coleoptile length and emergence of South African winter wheats (Triticum aestivum L.)The effect of four seed treatments and storage period of treated seed on the germination, coleoptile length and emergence of five winter wheat genotypes was investigated. The first trial was conducted under controlled conditions to determine the effect of triadimenol, terbuconazole, flutriafol + thiabendazole and carboxin + thiram-treated seed at recommended rates on the germination and coleoptile length of five genotypes, viz. Betta, Tugela, Molen, T85/21 and Karee. A second trial was conducted under field conditions to determine the percentage emergence of Betta and T85/21 treated with the same seed treatments and planted 30 mm and 60 mm deep. Significant seed treatment × genotype × storage period interactions for germination occurred. All seed treatments had an effect to varying degrees on the germination of genotypes after the nine- month storage period but not on the seed treated directly prior to germination. Significant seed treatment × genotype × storage interactions occurred for coleoptile length. Triadimenol and flutriafol + thiabendazole consistently reduced coleoptile length while terbuconazole only reduced coleoptile length alter the nine-month storage period. Carboxin + thiram had no detrimental effect on coleoptile length. No significant second or first order interactions occurred for seedling emergence, but the seed treatment effect was highly significant.
