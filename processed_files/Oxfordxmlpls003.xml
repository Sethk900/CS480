Mean pixel intensity responds linearly to purified GFP titration.Studies have shown that levels of green fluorescent protein (GFP) leaf surface fluorescence are directly proportional to GFP soluble protein concentration in transgenic plants. However, instruments that measure GFP surface fluorescence are expensive. The goal of this investigation was to develop techniques with consumer digital cameras to analyse GFP surface fluorescence in transgenic plants.Inexpensive filter cubes containing machine vision dichroic filters and illuminated with blue light-emitting diodes (LED) were designed to attach to digital single-lens reflex (SLR) camera macro lenses. The apparatus was tested on purified enhanced GFP, and on wild-type and GFP-expressing arabidopsis grown autotrophically and heterotrophically.Spectrum analysis showed that the apparatus illuminates specimens with wavelengths between âˆ¼450 and âˆ¼500 nm, and detects fluorescence between âˆ¼510 and âˆ¼595 nm. Epifluorescent photographs taken with SLR digital cameras were able to detect red-shifted GFP fluorescence in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> leaves and cotyledons of pot-grown plants, as well as roots, hypocotyls and cotyledons of etiolated and light-grown plants grown heterotrophically. Green fluorescent protein fluorescence was detected primarily in the green channel of the raw image files. Studies with purified GFP produced linear responses to both protein surface density and exposure time (H<sub>0</sub>: <italic>Î²</italic> (slope) = 0 mean counts per pixel (ng s mm<sup>âˆ’2</sup>)<sup>âˆ’1</sup>, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.994, <italic>n</italic> = 31, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 1.75 Ã— 10<sup>âˆ’29</sup>).Epifluorescent digital photographs taken with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor and charge-coupled device SLR cameras can be used to analyse red-shifted GFP surface fluorescence using visible blue light. This detection device can be constructed with inexpensive commercially available materials, thus increasing the accessibility of whole-organism GFP expression analysis to research laboratories and teaching institutions with small budgets.DNA sequences encoding green fluorescent protein (<italic>gfp</italic>) have become widely used in reporter genes because the encoded green fluorescent protein (GFP) can be detected without the addition of exogenous factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C4">Chalfie <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C47">Tsien 1998</xref>). As a result, <italic>gfp</italic> has become widely used in whole-plant experimentation, including studies on viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C22">Leffel <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C39">Rodman <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C52">Yambao <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>), identification of transformed plant tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C22">Leffel <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C2">Blumenthal <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C11">Halfhill <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C27">Molinier and Hahne 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C17">HraÅ¡ka <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>) and the monitoring of potential gene flow from transgenic crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C22">Leffel <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C44">Stewart 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C45">Stewart 2006</xref>). In whole-plant studies, ultraviolet (UV) light has often been used to observe GFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C22">Leffel <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C15">Harper <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C44">Stewart 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C39">Rodman <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C13">Halfhill <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C11">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C55">Zhu <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). There are potential problems in using UV light sources, such as cellular damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C23">Li <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C20">Kaiserli and Jenkins 2007</xref>) and potential injury to experimenters. Thus, there are significant advantages in detecting whole-plant GFP expression with visible light.Fortunately, the original <italic>gfp</italic> sequence cloned from the bioluminescent jelly fish <italic>Aequorea victoria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C34">Prasher <italic>et al.</italic> 1992</xref>) has been extensively modified to improve its use as a reporter gene. The wild-type protein has two excitation peaks: a major peak in the UV range and a minor peak in the visible blue range of the electromagnetic spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C4">Chalfie <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C47">Tsien 1998</xref>). Several <italic>gfp</italic> variants have been created by point mutations that change the spectral properties of encoded protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C47">Tsien 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C16">Haseloff 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C32">Patterson <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C44">Stewart 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C45">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C21">Kremers <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). In one point mutant named <italic>gfp(S65T)</italic>, a conversion of serine to threonine at position 65 produced a GFP with a spectrum shifted to the red portion of the visible light spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C6">Chiu <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>). Additionally, it had 100 times greater quantum yield. Transgenic plants expressing the <italic>gfp(S65T)</italic> gene show little phototoxicity when illuminated by visible blue light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C31">Niwa <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>). Thus red-shifted <italic>gfp</italic> genes make ideal markers for <italic>in planta</italic> assays. A second point mutation has been added to <italic>gfp(S65T)</italic> that produced an F64L substitution in the GFP. The resulting protein has greater stability at 37 Â°C and is called enhanced GFP (EGFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C53">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>).Leaf surface fluorescence can be used to assess the amount of GFP present in the leaves. Studies involving direct comparison of surface fluorescence and GFP content in soluble protein extracts have shown linear relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C2">Blumenthal <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C15">Harper <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C38">Richards <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C13">Halfhill <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). Green fluorescent protein leaf surface fluorescence can be measured with probes that clip onto leaves, laboratory-based fluorescent imaging systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C31">Niwa <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C26">Millwood <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C38">Richards <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C13">Halfhill <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C45">Stewart 2006</xref>) and dissecting fluorescent microscopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C54">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C19">Jach 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C18">HraÅ¡ka <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C52">Yambao <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). Although all of these systems have specific advantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C13">Halfhill <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>), they are all expensive. For example, Photon Systems Instruments (Brno-Å˜eÄkovice, Czech Republic), a manufacturer of a diverse array of plant fluorescence detection systems, sells GFP fluorescence imaging instruments that range in price from â‚¬13 990 (âˆ¼US$20 160) to â‚¬17 690 (âˆ¼US$25 500) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C50">Website 1</xref>).Consumer digital single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras are much less expensive than laboratory digital imaging systems and can capture images at very high resolution, typically ranging between 4 and 12 megapixels in a 16-bit format. They use either a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) detector or a charge-coupled device (CCD) detector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C28">Nakamura 2006</xref>). Digital SLR cameras have been used to develop a medical device that detects cells stained with fluorescent dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C43">Shin <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). Here we report on the development of a device that uses blue light-emitting diode (LED) illumination and uses similar beam-splitting optics found in epifluorescent compound microscopes to detect red-shifted GFP fluorescence. It can be attached to digital SLR cameras and dissecting microscopes. The device allows for the quantification of red-shifted GFP surface fluorescence in pot-grown and Petri plate<italic>-</italic>germinated transgenic plants and in other organisms. The camera attachment can be assembled at a fraction of the cost of other fluorescent imaging systems.<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (arabidopsis) lines were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C37">Rhee <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>). Wild-type plants were Columbia-O. Transgenic plants CS84732 (also known as LE8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C8">Cutler <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>) expressed EGFP under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. Variegated <italic>im</italic>-1 mutant (CS3218) was an X-ray-generated mutant from ecotype Col-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C36">Redei 1967</xref>). Seeds were sown onto hydrated Ferry-Morse (Fulton, KY, USA) peat pellets (no perlite or vermiculite) containing the recommended concentration of 24-8-6 Miracle Grow fertilizer (Scotts Co. LLC, Marysville, OH, USA). To produce more uniform germination, <italic>A. thaliana</italic> seeds were vernalized at 4 Â°C for 3 days. <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic>, variety tricolor sage, was purchased from a retail outlet. All plants were grown at 22 Â°C, 50 % relative humidity and 24-h illumination by cool white fluorescent light at a photosynthetically active radiation intensity of âˆ¼125 ÂµE m<sup>âˆ’2</sup> s<sup>âˆ’1</sup>.<bold>Light-emitting diode light source and filter cube attached to digital camera.</bold> (A) Royal blue LED (5 W) array with a 10Â° collimator.

(F) Double convex <italic>f</italic> = 50 mm lens placed 19.5 cm from LED array. The blackened tube had an inner diameter of 25 mm. The filter cube, assembled out of 3 mm blackened Masonite, holds a 45Â° blue light reflective (G) dichroic filter and barrier filters made from yellow (H) and cyan (I) dichroic glass. The filter cubeâ€“LED assembly was attached to the digital camera (J) with a Cokin (Piktus, France) filter holder. The directions of blue, green and red light rays are shown with correspondingly coloured arrows. A GFP-expressing plant is shown (K).Digital images were captured with the Canon EOS 30D in a series of exposures ranging from 1 to 20 s. Expanding cotyledons of 12- to 19-day-old seedlings were photographed in three biological replicates of the experiment.Additional photographs were taken with the Canon EOS 30D (ISO 1600) attached to a Tritech Research (Los Angeles, CA, USA) model SMT1-FL fluorescent dissecting microscope using a GFP illumination system and a GFP filter set provided by the manufacturer. The density of 12-day-old seedlings was high enough to have two or more seedlings visible in the Ã—6 magnification. Expanded cotyledons were photographed. An exposure time of 2 s was used with the microscope and 0.5 s with the filter cube.Spectra of dichroic filters and methanol leaf extracts were measured with a Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan) UV-1201S scanning spectrophotometer. Chlorophyll extraction and measurements were performed as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C25">Meeks and Castenholz (1971</xref>). The diluent was 90 % methanol. To remove chlorophyll from wild-type arabidopsis, whole pot-grown plants were placed in 95 % ethanol in a 4 Â°C refrigerator overnight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C54">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>).Enhanced GFP purchased from Biovision (Mountain View, CA, USA) was diluted in 1 Ã— phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C41">Sambrook <italic>et al.</italic> 1989</xref>) and placed in blackened flat-bottom microtitre plates. Green channel counts observed in 1 Ã— PBS wells were subtracted from the counts observed in EGFP-containing wells.Arabidopsis seeds were surface sterilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C49">Valvekens <italic>et al.</italic> 1988</xref>) and sown on germination medium (GM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C49">Valvekens <italic>et al.</italic> 1988</xref>) modified by substituting 0.5 % Gelrite (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) for agar. Transgenic seeds were sown on GM containing 50 Î¼g mL<sup>âˆ’1</sup> kanamycin sulphate. To produce uniform germination, seeds were cold treated in the dark at 4 Â°C for 4 days. Seeds were germinated with the Petri plates in a vertical position for 9 days. Etiolated plants were grown in darkness at 22 Â°C. Control plants were grown in light (âˆ¼50 Î¼E m<sup>âˆ’2</sup> s<sup>âˆ’1</sup>) at 22 Â°C with a 16- h photoperiod.ImageJ 1.40g was downloaded from the National Institutes of Health website (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C35">Rasband, Website</xref>). The plug-in, DCRaw V.1.0.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C7">Coffin, Website</xref>), was downloaded from Sourceforge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C51">Website 2</xref>). Camera raw files were opened with DCRaw, without adding white balance, read as 16-bit linear files with an interpolation quality of three. Measurements were expressed as counts per pixel (cpp). The ImageJ ROI Tool was used to take measurements from serial images. Logarithmic TIFF files were created from the raw CR2 files using Digital Photo Professional (version 2.1.1.4; Canon USA, Lake Success, NY, USA) at its default setting (no white balance, gamma corrected). The raw file images obtained from plants grown on GM medium were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS3 (San Jose, CA, USA). The effects of media glare were reduced using the following setting: temp 7500, tint +30, exposure +2.80, brightness +50, contrast +25. Statistical analysis was conducted with Microsoft (Seattle, WA, USA) Excel 2007 (version 12.0.6504.5001).<bold>Photographs of GFP-expressing and non-expressing plants under different lighting sources and camera filters.</bold> Thirteen-day-old wild-type and GFP-expressing (35S/GFP) arabidopsis seedlings are shown. (A) White light with no barrier filter. (B)â€“(G) were illuminated with 5 W royal blue LED with magenta excitation filters, 30Â° tilt, 30 cm from plants producing a light intensity of 8700 lx. (B) No barrier filter. (C) Quantaray YA2 barrier filter. (D) Hoya O [G] barrier filter. (E) NightSea BB barrier filter. (F) Yellow dichroic glass barrier filter.

(H) Yellow dichroic glass barrier filter. (I) Combination of yellow and cyan dichroic glass barrier filters. The Canon EOS 30D camera was set with an aperture of 8.0 and an ISO of 1600.Since none of the filter combinations was sufficient to produce artefact-free photographs, a filter cube containing inexpensive machine vision-enhancing dichroic filters was constructed (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F1">1</xref>). The filter cube containing a single yellow dichroic barrier filter was effective in blocking reflected blue light, and allowed detection of both red chlorophyll fluorescence and green GFP fluorescence (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F2">2</xref>H). A barrier filter consisting of a combination of yellow dichroic glass and cyan dichroic glass was effective in blocking red chlorophyll fluorescence while transmitting green GFP fluorescence. The resulting photograph produced high contrast between the wild-type plants and the GFP-expressing plants (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F2">2</xref>I).<bold>Epifluorescent image of wild-type and GFP-expressing arabidopsis.</bold> Rows: wild-type (top) and transgenic (bottom) plants. Transcription of the GFP open reading frame was under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter (35S/GFP). Columns: colour TIFF images and the three grey-scale colour channels viewed using ImageJ. The Canon EOS 30D camera with a filter cube containing yellow and cyan barrier filters was set with an aperture of 8.0, an ISO of 1600 and an exposure time of 1.3 s. The light intensity was âˆ¼11 660 lx. A 2 mm size standard is shown in both colour images.<bold>Spectrum of filter cube camera attachment.</bold> Transmittance spectra of the excitation filter (magenta excitation), a 45Â° dichroic beam-splitting filter (45Â° blue reflective), and the barrier filters consisting of both long-pass yellow dichroic glass and short-pass cyan glass are shown.

The regions of the spectrum corresponding to red-shifted GFP fluorescence (GFP fluorescence) and <italic>in planta</italic> chlorophyll fluorescence (chlorophyll fluorescence) are labelled.<bold>Comparing signal-to-noise ratios with different barrier filter combinations.</bold> Mixed populations of wild-type and transgenic plants expressing GFP under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter were grown in peat-based potting mix. Exposure times ranged from 0.05 to 5 s. Using direct illumination with the 5 W royal blue LED with magenta excitation filter (8700 lx), plants were photographed with Hoya O [G] filter, Nightsea yellow filter, yellow dichroic filter and yellow plus cyan dichroic filters. The filter cube (FC) illuminated the plants at 11 660 lx, using either a yellow dichroic barrier filter or a combination of yellow and cyan dichroic barrier filters. The camera was set with an aperture of 8.0 and an ISO of 1600. Pixel intensity measurements were taken from expanded cotyledons.To compare the performance of the inexpensive filter cube attachment to that of a research-grade instrument, mixed populations of transgenic and wild-type plants were sown at a high enough density so that two or more seedlings could be photographed simultaneously. The mean signal-to-noise ratio for the dissecting scope was 4.99 (95 % confidence interval was 6.30â€“3.68, degrees of freedom (df) = 13). When the same population of plants was photographed with the filter cube, the mean signal-to-noise ratio was 5.81 (95 % confidence interval was 6.83â€“4.89, df = 15). When a two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test (two-sided, assuming unequal variance) was performed, the difference in the means was not statistically significant (<italic>t</italic> = 1.07, df = 26, <italic>P</italic> = 0.294).<bold>Camera response to a GFP titration.</bold> Enhanced GFP titrations in blackened microtitre plates were photographed with the epifluorescent filter cube containing a yellow dichroic barrier filter. (A) Response of 1 s exposure with a Canon CMOS camera. Photographic conditions were an illumination of 20 200 lx, ISO of 800, aperture of 8.0. (B) Response combining 1, 2, 3.2, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10 s exposures. (C) Response combining 1, 2, 3.2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13 and 15 s, with a Nikon CCD camera, 21 500 lx, ISO of 800 and an aperture of 8.0.<bold>CMOS and CCD detector response to red-shifted GFP fluorescence.</bold> Enhanced GFP (A and B: 79 ng mm<sup>âˆ’2</sup>; C: 32.7 ng mm<sup>âˆ’2</sup>) in blackened microtitre plate wells (A, inset) were photographed with exposure times ranging from 0.1 to 25 s with the LED illuminated filter cube (A and B: 14 550 lx; C: 20 200 lx). Both cameras were set with an ISO of 800 and an aperture of 8.0. Counts observed from wells (inset 1) containing dilution buffer (1Ã— PBS) were subtracted from EGFP light intensity measurements (inset 2). (A) Canon camera with CMOS detector configured with the filter cube containing a combination of dichroic yellow glass and cyan dichroic glass as the barrier filter. (B) Same camera as (A), with only a yellow dichroic barrier filter.

Fluorescent photographs were taken with a Canon CMOS-containing camera with the filter cube containing a yellow dichroic barrier filter. Illumination intensity was 14 550 lx. (B) Nikon CCD-containing camera with the same filter cube used in (A) (chlorophyll at 158 ng Î¼L<sup>âˆ’1</sup>, 20 000 lx). Both cameras were set with an ISO of 800 and an aperture of 8.0. Exposure times ranged from 0.001 to 1.25 s. Counts observed from the dilution buffer (90 % methanol) were subtracted from the fluorescent pigment measurements.<bold>Digital camera response to <italic>in planta</italic> GFP expression.</bold> A mixed population of 13-day-old peat-grown wild-type (Wt.) seedlings and transgenic seedlings expressing the CaMV35S/GFP chimeric gene (35S/GFP) were photographed with a CMOS-containing Canon camera with the filter cube attachment containing a barrier filter made of yellow dichroic glass (A) or a barrier filter made of a combination of yellow and cyan dichroic glass (B). The photographs had exposure times from 0.05 to 30 s. Photographic conditions were an aperture of 8.0, an ISO of 1600 and an illumination intensity of 11 660 lx. Pixel intensity measurements were taken from expanded cotyledons.Green fluorescence was detected in wild-type plants with both the CMOS-containing (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F9">9</xref>) and CCD-containing cameras [see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/pls003/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Additional Information</ext-link>]. The main difference between the cameras was the sensitivity. The signal-to-noise ratio of the Canon camera was 16.1 when the yellow barrier filter was used (Fig. 9A), and 13.3 when both the cyan and yellow filters were combined (Fig. 9B). In contrast, the Nikon's signal-to-noise ratios were 6.8 and 8.5, respectively. The sum of these results shows that GFP surface fluorescence levels can be measured <italic>in planta</italic> when corresponding background counts are subtracted. However, overexposed photographs start to produce aberrant signals.<bold>Endogenous background fluorescence.</bold> Variegated arabidopsis was photographed with white light (A) and with a filter cube containing a yellow barrier filter (B). The Canon EOS 30D camera setting for the fluorescent images was 5 s exposure, ISO 400 and f/8.0. The light intensity was âˆ¼11 000 lx. ImageJ was used to measure green pixel intensity from the green regions and white regions of the variegated plants (C). Range bars are 95% confidence intervals. Wild-type Columbia-O plants were photographed with the filter cube containing a yellow barrier filter (0.03 s exposure, ISO 1600, f/2.8, intensity of âˆ¼10 000 lx) before 95 % ethanol extraction (D) and after extraction (photography conditions the same as D) (E). Green channel pixel intensity was measured (F). Range bars are 95 % confidence intervals.To determine whether background green fluorescence was inherent in normal leaf material, the chlorophyll of wild-type arabidopsis leaves was removed by ethanol extraction. Fluorescent photographs showed that after the red fluorescence caused by chlorophyll (Fig. 10D) was removed, additional endogenous fluorescence was revealed (Fig. 10E). Measurement of the pixel intensities showed that green fluorescence increased 3.46-fold after ethanol extraction (Fig. 10F). Student's <italic>t</italic>-test showed that the difference was statistically significant (H<sub>0</sub>: <italic>Î¼</italic><sub>before extraction</sub> = <italic>Î¼</italic><sub>after extraction</sub>, assuming unequal variance, <italic>t</italic> = 2.13, df = 15, <italic>P</italic> = 6.75 Ã— 10<sup>âˆ’8</sup>).<bold>Effect of leaf necrosis and chlorosis on background fluorescence.</bold> Leaves from wild-type arabidopsis were photographed with white light (A), with the filter cube containing a yellow barrier filter (Canon EOS 30D camera, 1.0 s exposure, ISO 400, f/8.0, intensity of âˆ¼8000 lx) (B) and the filter cube containing yellow and cyan barrier filters (same photographic conditions as B) (C). Leaves 1 and 2 were controls; leaves 3 and 5 were necrotic; leaf 4 was chlorotic; and leaf 6 was necrotic on the tip and chlorotic in the middle region. The size bar is 1 cm.<bold>Green fluorescent protein fluorescence in etiolated plants.</bold> Transgenic seed expressing the CaMV35S/EGFP (GFP) chimeric gene (Aâ€“D) and wild-type (Wt.) seeds (Eâ€“H) were grown on germination medium in darkness (dark) or in the light (light) for 9 days. Photographs were taken with white light (A, C, E and G) and with the filter cube (B, D, F and H) holding yellow and cyan barrier filters (39 900 lx, 3.2 s, ISO 400, aperture 8.0). Green channel pixel intensities corresponding to cotyledons, hypocotyls and roots are shown in (I). Range bars are 95 % confidence intervals.The authors' goal was to develop an experimental system in which undergraduates could perform quantitative inquiry investigations with transgenic plants expressing GFP, thus supporting the educational goals of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C29">National Research Council (1996</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C30">Â 2003</xref>). Instruments designed to measure surface GFP expression are expensive and thus inaccessible for many research and most teaching laboratories. To overcome this barrier, the authors wanted to utilize inexpensive techniques to detect and quantify GFP expression. The initial plan was to use commercially available hand-held LED illumination systems designed for GFP detection. However, these devices were not suitable because of non-uniform illumination and filters that produced photographic artefacts (for example, see Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F2">2</xref>E). Consumer camera filters were also not suitable because of numerous photographic artefacts, some of which are presented in Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F2">2</xref>C and D. Dichroic filters were an improvement over consumer photographic filters (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F5">5</xref>), but were not effective in blocking blue excitation light (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F2">2</xref>F and G).The epifluorescent device illustrated in Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F1">1</xref> works like the filter cubes found in epifluorescent compound microscopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C40">Ruzin 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C1">Billinton and Knight 2001</xref>), and is designed to be inexpensive while still being effective in imaging red-shifted GFP fluorescence. The device can be attached to most commercial SLR cameras and many dissecting microscopes because it is mounted with a Cokin (Piktus, France) lens filter holder which includes a number of size adapters. The fact that GFP fluorescence was measured in pot-grown plants (FigsÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F3">3</xref>) in addition to plants growing on agar medium (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F11">11</xref>) shows that the device is effective and flexible. Additionally, because of the flexibility of the apparatus design, this technique can be used in many research applications. The spectral properties of the apparatus (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F4">4</xref>) should allow it to work with non-plant organisms such as GFP-expressing <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. The apparatus has been successfully used with GFP-expressing <italic>Danio rerio</italic> along with fluorescent minerals like willemite and calcite [see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/pls003/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Additional Information</ext-link>].The device is inexpensive because it was constructed mostly from mass-produced materials. Blue LEDs have been shown to be effective light sources for fluorescent microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C5">Chin-Sang, Website</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C24">Martin <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). The light source (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F1">1</xref>) contained a Luxeon V royal blue LED. The spectrum is reported to have a range of âˆ¼420â€“500 nm with a single emission peak of 490 nm (Technical Data DS34, Lumileds Lighting), falling within the reported excitation wavelengths of red-shifted GFPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C6">Chiu <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C53">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C32">Patterson <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). This lamp has been successfully used to view <italic>C. elegans</italic> expressing high levels of GFP without the addition of an excitation filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C5">Chin-Sang, Website</xref>); however, when the spectrum was observed with a hand-held spectroscope, detectable emission of green light was observed. Thus, an excitation filter was included with the apparatus.Dichroic filters designed to enhance machine vision devices were used because they are much less expensive than epifluorescent microscope filter sets. The excitation filter (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F1">1</xref>) was made of magenta dichroic glass because it does not emit light longer than âˆ¼500 nm (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F4">4</xref>). The 45Â° reflective filter (50 mm Ã— 50 mm) was large enough to accommodate the field of view of a 100-mm macro-lens, reflect light with wavelengths &lt;500 nm, and provide additional improvement of the excitation light quality by allowing wavelengths &gt;500 nm to pass through the filter cube. Reflected light with wavelengths &lt;500 nm was blocked by the 45Â° reflective filter and the long-pass yellow dichroic filter, resulting in images with little or no reflected light and allowing fluorescence caused by GFP and chlorophyll to be detected (FigsÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F2">2</xref>H). This combination of filters produced the greatest signal-to-noise ratio in GFP-expressing transgenic arabidopsis (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F5">5</xref>). When the green channel pixel intensity of the raw files was measured, the counts observed in GFP-expressing transgenic arabidopsis were 16-fold greater than those observed in the equivalent exposure of wild-type plants. If the red fluorescence caused by chlorophyll is not desired in the photograph, a short-pass cyan dichroic filter can be added (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F2">2</xref>) to block wavelengths longer than âˆ¼590 nm (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F4">4</xref>), thus obscuring the light emitted by chlorophyll (FigsÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F1">1</xref>I, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F12">12</xref>B). Unfortunately, adding the cyan filter reduces the signal-to-noise ratio to 12.5-fold above background (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F5">5</xref>).The performance of the device is comparable to fluorescent dissecting microscopes specially designed to detect GFP (Tritech Research model SMT1-FL). To compare the two instruments, a mixed population of GFP-expressing and wild-type seeds was sown at a high enough density so that two or more germinating seedlings could be viewed in the microscope's Ã—6 field of view. After photographing using the Canon EOS 30D camera body, the same plants were photographed using the filter cube. The observed signal-to-noise ratios were 4.99 and 5.81, respectively. The differences in the ratios were not statistically significant.The machine vision filters are not optimized for GFP fluorescence. Thus, the sensitivity of the apparatus can be improved by using dichroic filters specifically made for GFP detection. However, research-grade 45Â° beam-splitting filters are âˆ¼8 times more expensive than the filter used in this study. The barrier filters are âˆ¼18 times more expensive. The manufacturing tolerance of the machine vision filters is somewhat broader (Â±3 % at <italic>R</italic><sub>50 %</sub>) than that of epifluorescence microscope dichroic filters (Â±2 % at <italic>R</italic><sub>50 %</sub>) (per Technical Support, Edmund Optics Inc., Barrington, NJ, USA). However, the device can be reliably produced as long as spectrophotometric scans of the filters are used to confirm the filters' optical properties. The comparable signal-to-noise ratio of the apparatus and a research-grade fluorescent dissecting microscope show that the use of mass production dichroic filters is a pragmatic compromise between costs and performance.Both the CMOS and CCD image detectors responded quantitatively to red-shifted GFP fluorescence. When a titration of purified EGFP was photographed with the filter cube (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F6">6</xref>), the linear regression of the green channel pixel intensity produced a statistically significant correlation coefficient in response to GFP surface density (ng mm<sup>âˆ’2</sup>) with the regression line passing through a <italic>y</italic>-intercept of zero. The cameras responded linearly to exposure time as well (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F7">7</xref>). When green channel pixel intensity was plotted against GFP surface density by exposure times (ng s mm<sup>âˆ’2</sup>), the resulting regression line was statistically significant. Thus, pixel intensity is directly proportional to both GFP surface density and exposure time (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F6">6</xref>) when the protein is contained in a transparent solution.The implication of these results is that both CMOS and CCD digital SRL cameras might be used to quantify surface GFP fluorescence. However, comparisons between surface fluorescence and <italic>in planta</italic> GFP protein concentrations have not been made in this investigation. Other investigators have found linear relationships between surface fluorescence and GFP protein concentrations in plant tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C2">Blumenthal <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C15">Harper <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C38">Richards <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C13">Halfhill <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). Because both GFP fluorescence and background fluorescence are affected by physiology and development <italic>in situ</italic>, standard curves will need to be performed for each experimental system investigated.Colour CMOS and CCD detectors contain Bayer colour filter arrays that give each pixel some degree of colour specificity by preferentially transmitting green, blue or red photons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C48">Turchetta <italic>et al.</italic>, Website</xref>). The transmittance spectrum of each green pixel filter overlaps the transmittance spectrum of both the red and blue pixel filters in the Canon EOS 30D/40D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C3">Buil, Website</xref>) and the Nikon D80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C42">Schmitt, Website</xref>). To confirm that EGFP fluorescence is detected primarily in the green channel of digital images, exposure time series of photographs were taken of purified EGFP. When the filtered cube's barrier filter contained a combination of yellow and cyan dichroic glass, GFP fluorescence was only observed in the green channel of the Canon camera (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F7">7</xref>A). When the cyan dichroic glass was removed, a steeper linear response was observed in the green channel. Additionally, a 6.6-fold smaller linear response was also detected in the red channel (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F7">7</xref>B). The latter result indicates that some of EGFP's fluorescence was detected by the red channel when the barrier filter only contained yellow dichroic glass. The Nikon camera, in contrast, did not produce a red-channel response when the filter cube only contained a yellow barrier filter (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F7">7</xref>C), indicating this camera has better colour specificity for EGFP fluorescence.To ascertain whether chlorophyll fluorescence affects the green channel of the camera, leaf pigments were extracted with methanol and quantified spectrophotometrically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C25">Meeks and Castenholz 1971</xref>). When the green leaf extracts in the wells of microtitre plates were photographed with the filter cube containing a yellow dichroic barrier filter, a positive linear response with exposure time was observed in the red channel of both the Canon and Nikon digital cameras (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F8">8</xref>). A slightly negative slope was observed in the green channel of the Canon image files (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F8">8</xref>A). The negative slope was probably due to chlorophyll light absorption blocking the green background fluorescence caused by the microtitre plates. In subsequent experiments with the Nikon camera (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F8">8</xref>B), a different style of blackened microtitre plate was used that produced 4-fold less background counts. The sum of these results suggests that fluorescent measurements of red-shifted GFPs can be made from counts observed in the green channel when using SLR digital cameras.Long exposures should not be taken when making quantitative measurements with digital cameras. Both CMOS and CCD detectors lose colour fidelity when their photodiodes become saturated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C9">Fellers and Davidson, Website</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C46">Tian <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Once saturated, contiguous photodiodes start to accept charges, a phenomenon known as blooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C9">Fellers and Davidson, Website</xref>) or crosstalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C46">Tian <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). The effect of blooming became evident in Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F9">9</xref> when the green channel mean pixel intensity was &gt;60 000 cpp. Sixteen-bit cameras have a theoretical saturation level of 2<sup>16</sup> = 65 536 cpp. In the photographs taken with the filter cube that blocked red light with a cyan filter (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F9">9</xref>B), counts in the red channel were detected in exposures &gt;10 s, which corresponds to the exposure times that the green channel pixel intensities approached 60 000 cpp in the CMOS-containing Canon camera. Additionally, the blue channel started to produce counts in photographs of plants expressing GFP after 30 s of exposure (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F9">9</xref>A and B) but not in photographs of wild-type plants. This result indicates that the blue photodiodes started to accept charges when the green pixels became saturated. Similar results were observed with a CCD-containing Nikon camera [see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/pls003/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Additional Information</ext-link>]. Therefore, pixel intensity measurements should not be taken when any of the colour channels approach saturation.Autofluorescence can interfere with the detection of GFP. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C54">Zhou <italic>et al</italic>. (2005)</xref> showed that chlorophyll can completely obscure GFP fluorescence in <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> (alfalfa) and <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (rice). The chlorophyll concentration varies with the age and species of leaf. They proposed that the chlorophylls absorbed the excitation photon, thus reducing GFP fluorescence. Fortunately, mature arabidopsis leaves are not as affected by its chlorophyll as alfalfa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C54">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). However, materials other than red-fluorescing chlorophyll appear to produce interfering fluorescence in arabidopsis.Green background fluorescence was detected in the leaves of wild-type arabidopsis (FigsÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F10">10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F12">12</xref>). Since methanol leaf pigment extracts did not produce detectable green fluorescence (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F8">8</xref>), substances other than chlorophyll are the likely source of this background. Several substances have been identified as potential sources of unwanted green autofluorescence, including lignin, flavins, nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate and aromatic amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C1">Billinton and Knight 2001</xref>). Experiments with variegated varieties of plants (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F10">10</xref>A) showed increased green fluorescence in the albino regions of the leaves. In arabidopsis, there was 3.06-fold greater green autofluorescence. Similar results were observed in variegated garden sage [see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/pls003/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Additional Information</ext-link>]. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C54">Zhou <italic>et al</italic>. (2005)</xref> showed that ethanol extraction of whole leaves can remove pigments that obscured GFP fluorescence. Green autofluorescence increased by 2.4-fold when ethanol was used to extract leaf pigments from wild-type arabidopsis (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F10">10</xref>Dâ€“F). The increase in autofluorescence could be caused by reducing the interference caused by chlorophyll (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C54">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>) or by releasing fluorescent soluble materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C1">Billinton and Knight 2001</xref>) when cells were ruptured. In either case, these results indicate that materials other than chlorophylls are responsible for endogenous green background fluorescence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C2">Blumenthal <italic>et al.</italic> (1999)</xref> have shown that subtracting the <italic>in situ</italic> fluorescence spectrum of wild-type tobacco from the fluorescent spectrum of GFP-expressing tobacco produced â€˜differential emission spectraâ€™ that were nearly identical to the fluorescent spectrum of purified GFP. This observation indicates that the fluorescence spectrum of GFP-expressing plants is the sum of the GFP fluorescence and its autofluorescence. Thus, the green channel counts observed in negative controls should be subtracted from the counts observed in GFP-expressing plants. Developmental age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C14">Harper and Stewart 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C12">Halfhill <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C18">HraÅ¡ka <italic>et al.</italic> 2006, 2008</xref>), environmental growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C13">Halfhill <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>) and plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C54">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>) can affect the efficiency of GFP fluorescence detection. Thus, controls should be physiologically identical to GFP-expressing plants in terms of genetic background, developmental ages and growth conditions. Care should be taken when conducting experiments involving stress physiology. When leaves become necrotic or chlorotic (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F11">11</xref>), green fluorescence becomes evident in wild-type plants. A detailed discussion of the factors to consider when developing controls is presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C13">Halfhill <italic>et al.</italic> (2004)</xref>.The experiments presented in FigsÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F9">9</xref> were conducted in a manner that reduced the variability between treatment and control observations. The wild-type plants were the same ecotype as the transgenic lines. The wild-type plants and the GFP-expressing plants were sown in the same pot on the same day and grown at a density where they were not competing for light. To ensure developmental uniformity, all intensity measurements were taken from expanded cotyledons or the first true leaves. As a result, when background counts were subtracted from GFP measurements, the background counts were observed from plant tissues that were nearly identical both physiologically and developmentally.Non-green leaf tissue can have high levels of green fluorescence (FigsÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F10">10</xref>Aâ€“C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F11">11</xref>). However, some non-green plant tissues can be used in GFP expression experiments. For example, etiolated cotyledons, hypocotyls and roots expressing GFP produce statistically greater green pixel intensities than the corresponding organs of wild-type plants (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS003F12">12</xref>).Epifluorescent photographs taken with digital SLR cameras allow for the capturing of artefact-free images of whole plants without the use of damaging UV light and improve the signal-to-noise ratio. By using mass production materials, the cost of constructing the camera attachment is low, allowing resource-poor laboratories greater access to GFP imaging technology. The technology is flexible, making it amenable to capturing fluorescent images from a wide array of organisms, materials and experimental situations. It should be possible to modify the light source and/or dichroic filters to detect fluorescent sources as diverse as red fluorescent protein and enhanced blue fluorescent protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS003C32">Patterson <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>).<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/pls003/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">The following additional information is available in the online version of this article â€“</ext-link><bold>File 1.</bold> Diagram.
