Polytrichum strictum as a Nurse-Plant in Peatland Restoration.<em>Polytrichum strictum </em>is a pioneer plant frequently found on bare peat substrate after perturbations (fire, peat extraction). Can this moss facilitate the return of <em>Sphagnum </em>species or other boreal plants after disturbances? Field surveys of abandoned peatlands after peat extraction revealed that <em>Sphagnum </em>was always found in association with <em>P. strictum </em>carpets. We conducted field experiments in abandoned peatlands and showed that <em>P. strictum </em>carpets were able to keep <em>Sphagnum </em>fragments more humid than bare peat but only when the <em>P. strictum </em>carpets were not totally bone dry. In general, daytime temperatures beneath <em>P. strictum </em>carpets and fragments were reduced during the day and increased during the night compared to bare peat. <em>Polytrichum strictum </em>carpets acted as a seed trap, retaining more artificial seeds than bare peat. <em>Polytrichum strictum </em>can be a nurse-plant: after 16 months, vascular plants transplanted in the <em>P. strictum </em>carpet were healthier than the ones planted on bare peat. The use of <em>P. strictum </em>as a nurse-plant in boreal forest or peatland restoration is recommended for sites prone to frost heaving and with harsh microclimatic conditions.
