The paper describes the functional analysis of a class C heat shock transcription factor from rice ( Oryza sativa ). OsHsfC1b is shown to play a role in ABA-mediated salt stress tolerance and is required for plant growth under non-stress conditions.  Salt stress leads to attenuated growth and productivity in rice. Transcription factors like heat shock factors (HSFs) represent central regulators of stress adaptation. Heat shock factors of the classes A and B are well established as regulators of thermal and non-thermal stress responses in plants; however, the role of class C HSFs is unknown. Here we characterized the function of the OsHsfC1b (Os01g53220) transcription factor from rice.  We analysed the expression of  OsHsfC1b  in the rice  japonica  cultivars Dongjin and Nipponbare exposed to salt stress as well as after mannitol, abscisic acid (ABA) and H 2 O 2  treatment. For functional characterization of OsHsfC1b, we analysed the physiological response of a T-DNA insertion line ( hsfc1b ) and two  artificial micro -RNA ( ami RNA) knock-down lines to salt, mannitol and ABA treatment. In addition, we quantified the expression of  small Heat Shock Protein  ( sHSP ) genes and those related to signalling and ion homeostasis by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in roots exposed to salt. The subcellular localization of OsHsfC1b protein fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) was determined in  Arabidopsis  mesophyll cell protoplasts.  Expression of  OsHsfC1b  was induced by salt, mannitol and ABA, but not by H 2 O 2 . Impaired function of  OsHsfC1b  in the  hsfc1b  mutant and the  ami RNA lines led to decreased salt and osmotic stress tolerance, increased sensitivity to ABA, and temporal misregulation of salt-responsive genes involved in signalling and ion homeostasis. Furthermore,  sHSP  genes showed enhanced expression in knock-down plants under salt stress. We observed retarded growth of  hsfc1b  and knock-down lines in comparison with control plants under non-stress conditions. Transient expression of OsHsfC1b fused to GFP in protoplasts revealed nuclear localization of the transcription factor.  OsHsfC1b plays a role in ABA-mediated salt stress tolerance in rice. Furthermore, OsHsfC1b is involved in the response to osmotic stress and is required for plant growth under non-stress conditions.  Rice represents a major food source for more than half of the world's population. Among crops, rice exhibits the least, wheat a moderate and barley the strongest tolerance to salt stress ( Munns and Tester 2008 ). One reason for the low tolerance of rice to salinity is the high permeability of its roots to sodium ions. Sodium ions can easily enter the apoplast and subsequently rapidly lead to toxic intracellular concentrations. Since an increasing land area is affected by high salinity, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying salt tolerance of crops is of great societal and economic interest ( Yan  et al.  2005 ;  Obata  et al.  2007 ;  Hadiarto and Tran 2011 ). The response to salt stress includes expressional changes of stress-related genes, which among others encode protein kinases, ion transporters and transcription factors. In rice, several transcription factor families (e.g. MYB, NAC, bZIP and AP2/ERF) contribute to stress adaptation by regulating the expression of stress-responsive genes ( Hu  et al.  2006 ,  2008 ;  Ma  et al.  2009 ;  Wang  et al.  2009 ;  Hossain  et al.  2010 ;  Park  et al.  2010 ;  Takasaki  et al.  2010 ;  Mallikarjuna  et al.  2011 ;  Song  et al.  2011 ).  Heat shock factors (HSFs) are transcription factors that can structurally be classified into three classes: A, B and C. They consist of an N-terminal DNA-binding domain, an adjacent oligomerization domain (HR-A/B) and an additional class A-specific C-terminal activation domain containing aromatic, hydrophobic and acidic amino acid residues (AHA motif). In the HR-A/B domain, HSFs of the classes A and C harbour an inserted sequence of 21 and seven amino acid residues, respectively, which is absent from class B HSFs ( Nover  et al.  2001 ). In contrast to class A HSFs, class B HSFs act as transcriptional repressors while no clear activation or repression has been shown for class C HSFs ( Ikeda  et al . 2011 ). The number of HSF-encoding genes varies between plant species. The genome of the green alga  Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  contains two,  Arabidopsis thaliana  21 and rice 25  HSF  genes ( Nover  et al.  2001 ;  Schulz-Raffelt  et al.  2007 ;  Guo  et al.  2008 ). In rice, 13 HSFs can be assigned to class A (including the subclasses A1, A2 and A4), eight HSFs to class B and four HSFs to class C ( Guo  et al.  2008 ). Heat shock factors control gene expression by binding to the heat shock element, an inverted 5-bp repeat of the sequence ‘nGAAn’, found in the promoter regions of many heat-inducible genes ( Barros  et al.  1992 ;  Sun  et al.  2002 ). Heat shock factors also function as regulators of other  HSF  genes, demonstrated by HsfA1d and HsfA1e from  A. thaliana , which are involved in the expressional control of  HsfA2  ( Nishizawa-Yokoi  et al.  2011 ). Several HSFs of the classes A and B have been shown to play a role in the response to abiotic and biotic stresses. In  Arabidopsis , next to heat stress adaptation, HsfA2 controls the response to salt, osmotic stress, anoxia and submergence ( Ogawa  et al.  2007 ;  Banti  et al.  2010 ). HsfA1 in tomato functions as a master regulator of induced thermotolerance that cannot be replaced by any other HSF ( Mishra  et al.  2002 ). HsfB1 and HsfB2 from  Arabidopsis  demonstrate the relevance of class B members in stress tolerance, as the knock-out of  HsfB2  and the double knock-out of both  HSF  genes result in improved pathogen resistance ( Kumar  et al.  2009 ). The role of rice HSFs in stress adaptation is poorly understood. To date, two class A HSFs, i.e. OsHsfA2e and OsHsf7, have been functionally characterized  in vivo . Transgenic  Arabidopsis  plants overexpressing  OsHsfA2e  are more tolerant to heat and salt stress than control plants ( Yokotani  et al.  2008 ), and overexpression of  OsHsf7  in  Arabidopsis  results in an increased thermotolerance ( Liu  et al.  2009 ). The role of class C HSFs in stress response is currently unknown; however, expression patterns of class C  HSF  genes from rice suggest, in addition to a role in the heat shock response, a participation in non-thermal stress responses such as salt, drought and oxidative stress ( Hu  et al.  2009 ;  Mittal  et al.  2009 ;  Wang  et al.  2009 ). In particular,  OsHsfC1b  and  OsHsf2b  are highly responsive to salt and drought stress ( Hu  et al . 2009 ).  Besides stress, there is evidence for a role of HSFs in development. In animals and yeast, HSFs are involved in various non-stress processes, e.g. cell cycle progression, embryo development, cell differentiation and spermatogenesis ( Pirkkala  et al.  2001 ). Loss of the transcriptional activator HSF1 in mice results in increased prenatal lethality, retarded growth and female sterility ( Xiao  et al.  1999 ). The corresponding homologue in  Schizosaccharomyces pombe  is required for growth under control conditions ( Gallo  et al.  1993 ), whereas in  Drosophila melanogaster  HSF regulates oogenesis and larva development ( Jedlicka  et al.  1997 ). Transgenic  Arabidopsis  plants overexpressing  HsfA2  exhibit increased cell proliferation ( Ogawa  et al.  2007 ), which demonstrates the function of HSFs in plant growth control.  In this study, we functionally characterized the class C  HSF  gene  OsHsfC1b  from rice, which has been shown to be salt-responsive ( Hu  et al . 2009 ). By using transgenic lines we show that it plays a dual role in both growth and tolerance to non-thermal stresses.  Proteins homologous to OsHsfC1b were identified by BLAST searches on  http://www.phytozome.net/ . Multiple sequence alignment was done with Clustal X 2.0 ( Larkin  et al.  2007 ).  Seeds of transgenic rice lines ( hsfc1b ,  ami -7.1,  ami -13.3 and empty-vector control) and wild-type (Dongjin) plants were placed on hydroponic boxes with full-strength Yoshida medium ( Yoshida  et al.  1971 ) using styrofoam adaptors. Plants grown for 3 or 4 weeks at (day/night) 26/22 °C, 75/70 % relative humidity with a day length of 12 h and a light intensity of 700 µmol m −2  s –1  were subjected to salt stress by adding either 50 or 100 mM NaCl (final concentration) to the growth medium. Furthermore, hydroponically grown plants were treated with 100 mM mannitol, 5 µM abscisic acid (ABA) or 5 mM H 2 O 2 . T 1  seeds of  ami RNA and empty-vector lines were selected on 40 mg/L hygromycin. Leaves and roots were harvested separately. For estimation of biomass accumulation, fresh and dry weights of shoots and roots of five replicates each (from four plants in each experiment) were measured. After measurement, tissues were oven dried at 70 °C for 3 days, and the dry weight of each sample was measured. Subsequently, the relative biomass of the samples was calculated as the percentage of non-stressed plants.  Dehulled seeds were surface sterilized with 12 % NaOCl for 5 min and washed five times with distilled water. Subsequently, seeds were sown on vertical plates with Murashige–Skoog (MS) medium (3 % sucrose) containing NaCl (50 or 100 mM), ABA (1 or 5 µM) or mannitol (100 mM). Plates were incubated at (day/night) 26/22 °C, 75/70 % relative humidity with a day length of 12 h. Light intensity was set to 700 µmol m –2  s –1 .  The T-DNA insertion line 1B-09127.R (rice ssp.  japonica  cv. Dongjin) was ordered from the POSTECH RISD database ( Jeon  et al.  2000 ;  http://www.postech.ac.kr/life/pfg/risd/ ). Homozygous T 2  plants were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the primers 5′-CTCCTCCATGCCCCTCTG-3′ and 5′-TTGGGGTTTCTACAGGACGTAAC-3′ for detection of the mutant allele, and the primers 5′-CTGCTCTCATACGGAGGAGG-3′ and 5′-AAGACAGCAGCAACGGAAAG-3′ for wild-type allele detection. Seeds of homozygous plants were propagated two times and T 4  seeds were used for further analysis.  For the construction of an  artificial micro -RNA ( ami RNA) specific to  OsHsfC1b , primers harbouring  attB  sites were designed in WMD2 ( http://wmd2.weigelworld.org ) and multi-step PCR was performed as described ( Warthmann  et al.  2008 ). Subsequently, the  ami RNA construct was cloned into the pC5300 OE vector using BP clonase (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany). pC5300 OE was constructed by inserting an  attP1-ccdB-attP2  Gateway R  cassette into the multiple cloning site of pC1300intA.Ubi-tnos (also named IRS154) between the maize ubiquitin promoter/first exon/first intron sequence and the  NOS  polyadenylation sequence (J. C. Breitler, CIRAD, Montpellier, France, unpubl. res.). The backbone vector pC1300intA was originally constructed by  Ouwerkerk  et al.  (2001)  (GenBank accession number: AF294976). Rice calli of the Nipponbare cultivar were co-cultured with  Agrobacterium tumefaciens  strain EHA105 containing recombinant or empty pC5300 according to  Sallaud  et al.  (2003) .  For the subcellular localization study, the full-length CDS of  OsHsfC1b  was amplified by PCR from root cDNA (cv. Nipponbare) using two oligonucleotides (5′-CACCATGATGGGCGGCGAGTGCAA-3′ and 5′-CTAGTAGAACACTTGGCCAAGAA-3′) and cloned into pENTR vector (Invitrogen). Subsequently, the CDS was recombined at the N-terminus with green fluorescent protein (GFP) by Gateway transfer into the vector pK7WGF2.0 ( Karimi  et al.  2005 ).  Arabidopsis  mesophyll cell protoplasts were obtained and transformed with the GFP fusion construct according to  Wu  et al.  (2009) . Fluorescence imaging of the protoplasts was performed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (SP5; Leica Microsystems CMS, Mannheim, Germany).  RNA isolation from rice roots and leaves, cDNA synthesis and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) were performed as described ( Caldana  et al.  2007 ). Three biological replicates (with four plants each) were used for each experiment. The efficiency of cDNA synthesis was estimated by qRT-PCR using  ACTIN  (Os03g50885, forward primer 5′-CTCCCCCATGCTATCCTTCG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TGAATGAGTAACCACGCTCCG-3′) as reference gene. For expression analysis of  OsHsfC1b , the oligonucleotides 5′-GCAGCTCAACACCTACGGATTC-3′ and 5′-TTCTTCTTCTTGCGCACGATCC-3′ were used. Oligonucleotide sequences used for expression profiling of signalling and ion homoeostasis components are listed separately [see  Additional Information—File 1 ]. Oligonucleotide sequences for expression profiling of 12  sHSP  genes were designed with QuantPrime ( Arvidsson  et al.  2008 ) and are listed in  Additional Information (File 1) .   Phylogenetic analysis and subcellular localization of OsHsfC1b.  (A) Multiple sequence alignment of OsHsfC1b and homologous proteins. The DNA-binding domain consists of three α-helices (a1–a3) and four β-sheets (b1–b4). The black boxes represent the HR-A/B domain. All proteins harbour a putative NLS (red boxes). Protein sequence data were derived from phytozome ( www.phytozome.net ) under the following accession numbers:  O. sativa  OsHsfC1b (Os01g53220) and OsHsfC1a (Os01g43590);  Brachipodium distachyon  Bradi2g489 and Bradi2g440;  Sorghum bicolor  Sb03g03375 and Sb03g02847;  Zea mays  GRMZM2G086 and GRMZM2G089;  Setaria italica  Si002580m and Si002292m; and  Arabidopsis thaliana  AT3G24520.

(A) Relative expression of  OsHsfC1a  and  OsHsfC1b  in Nipponbare roots treated with 100 mM NaCl, 5 µM ABA, 100 mM mannitol or 5 mM H 2 O 2  for 30 min or 3 h, respectively. (B) Relative expression of  OsHsfC1a  and  OsHsfC1b  in Nipponbare leaves treated with 100 mM NaCl, 5 µM ABA, 100 mM mannitol or 5 mM H 2 O 2  for 30 min or 3 h, respectively.

Expression data in (A)–(C) and (E) represent means of three biological replicates (four plants each) ± SE. A star (*) indicates significant difference to expression under control conditions ( P  ≤ 0.05). FC, fold change.  In addition to Nipponbare plants, we tested the salt-dependent expression of  OsHsfC1b  in rice plants of the Dongjin cultivar (Fig.  2 C). In contrast to Nipponbare plants,  OsHsfC1b  was only induced in roots after 30 min of salt stress, showing an upregulation by ∼3.5-fold. We compared the expression profile of  OsHsfC1b  under the different treatments with the paralogous gene  OsHsfC1a  (Fig.  1 ). As observed for  OsHsfC1b ,  OsHsfC1a  was upregulated in Nipponbare roots exposed to salt stress for 30 min and 3 h, and to ABA treatment for 3 h (Fig.  2 A). Unlike its counterpart, however,  OsHsfC1a  was not induced by salt stress in Nipponbare leaves (Fig.  2 B). Moreover, it was downregulated by mannitol treatment in roots and induced by ABA in leaves. As shown for  OsHsfC1b ,  OsHsfC1a  was significantly induced by salt stress in Dongjin roots (Fig.  2 B).  For functional characterization of  OsHsfC1b , we identified a homozygous T-DNA insertion line (1B-09127.R) in the Dongjin background and named it  hsfc1b . The insertion site is located in the second exon of  OsHsfC1b  (Fig.  2 D). Additionally, we generated  ami RNA lines in the Nipponbare background and selected two independent lines,  ami -7.1 and  ami -13.3, for further characterization. Transgenic plants of the T 4  ( hsfc1b ) and T 1  generation ( ami RNA lines) were analysed regarding the expression of  OsHsfC1b  under non-stress conditions. In  hsfc1b  roots, we observed an 11-fold reduction of  OsHsfC1b  expression, while in  ami -13.3 roots the expression of  OsHsfC1b  was decreased by ∼5-fold as compared with control plants (Fig.  2 E). The transcript of  OsHsfC1b  was not detectable in roots of the  ami -7.1 line. Notably, during salt stress  OsHsfC1a  expression in the insertion line was similar to that in the wild type, suggesting that  OsHsfC1b  and  OsHsfC1a  act independently during the stress response [see  Additional Information—File 2 ].   Impact of OsHsfC1b on vegetative growth under normal conditions.  (A) Seven-day-old seedlings grown on MS medium.

(D) Root and shoot length of  hsfc1b  and Dongjin wild-type seedlings at 4 and 7 DAS grown on MS medium containing 100 mM mannitol relative to control seedlings. (E) Root and shoot length of  hsfc1b  and Dongjin wild-type seedlings at 4 and 7 DAS grown on MS medium containing 1 or 5 µM ABA, respectively, relative to untreated seedlings. (F) Root and shoot length of  ami -13.3,  ami -7.1 and Nipponbare empty-vector (EV) seedlings at 4 and 7 DAS grown on MS medium containing 1 µM ABA relative to untreated seedlings. Data in (A)–(F) are means of three independent experiments each ( n  = 12). A star (*) indicates significant difference to control ( P  ≤ 0.05). DAS, days after sowing.  Osmotic stress alone or in combination with salt or drought stress leads to diminished cell growth ( Munns and Tester 2008 ).  OsHsfC1b  expression is induced in Nipponbare roots exposed to mannitol (Fig.  2 A). For this reason, we tested the tolerance of  hsfc1b  plants to osmotic stress (Fig.  4 D). At 4 DAS,  hsfc1b  plants grown on MS medium containing 100 mM mannitol exhibited significantly greater reduced shoot and root lengths, and at 7 DAS a significantly greater reduced root length as compared with the stressed wild type was observed, suggesting a role of OsHsfC1b in the response to osmotic stress (Fig.  4 D).  Abscisic acid is involved in the response to many abiotic and biotic stresses, and exogenous ABA mimics effects caused by environmental stresses ( Zhu 2002 ). The expression of  OsHsfC1b  is ABA-inducible (Fig.  2 A), suggesting a potential role in ABA signalling and/or response. Seedlings of  hsfc1b  showed hypersensitivity towards ABA (1 and 5 µM), visible by diminished shoot and root length at 7 DAS (Fig.  4 E); this hypersensitivity was more prominent at 5 µM ABA. Seedlings of  ami -7.1 and  ami -13.3 had major problems in growing on 5 µM ABA, making a quantitative analysis impossible (data not shown). Therefore, we examined these parameters at 1 µM ABA (Fig.  4 F). Whereas the  ami -7.1 and the empty-vector control line showed a similar reduction of shoot and root length, those of  ami -13.3 were significantly more affected (Fig.  4 F).  Expression of genes encoding signalling and ion homeostasis components in  hsfc1b  and  ami -13.3 lines. Comparison of expression levels (log 2 FC) in roots of hsfc1b,  ami -13.3 and their respective controls under non-stress and salt stress conditions (100 mM NaCl). Values are presented as the relative expression level (log 2 FC) of three biological replicates. The values that are significantly different from control (ΔΔ C  T  ≤ −1 or ≥+1) by Student's  t -test are in bold ( P  ≤ 0.05).  FC, fold change; EV, empty-vector control; n.d., not determined.  After 30 min of salt stress, 13 genes were differentially expressed in Dongjin, six of which matched genes that were also differentially expressed in  hsfc1b  compared with the wild type under control conditions, including  ECA1 ,  AHA1 ,  VHA-c4 ,  HKT8 ,  GLR2.7  and  TIP2-1 , suggesting that the salt stress-associated gene regulatory network (GRN) is already in part activated in  hsfc1b  even in the absence of salt stress. A similar observation was made when  ami -13.3 was compared with empty-vector control plants. After 30 min of salt stress, 15 genes responded in empty-vector control plants including four genes, i.e.  MAP3K.4 ,  MAP3K.18 ,  CBL7  and  HAK4 , which were differentially expressed in  ami -13.3 under control conditions (Table  1 ). Exposure of  hsfc1b  roots to salt stress for 30 min induced nine genes which did not overlap with the genes responding in Dongjin wild-type roots at this time point. After 3 h of salt stress, seven and 13 genes were differentially expressed in Dongjin and  hsfc1b  roots, respectively. The only overlapping gene at this time point was  TIP3-2 ; five other genes responding in  hsfc1b  under salt stress overlapped with the 30-min time point for wild-type plants ( MAP3K.23 ,  CBL7 ,  HKT8, CaCA/ Os11g01580 and  TIP2-1 ) .  Furthermore,  CNGC2  (Os03g55100) showed a strong induction in Dongjin roots after 3 h, but was already induced in  hsfc1b  after 30 min of salt stress. For  ami -13.3, we observed diverging expression profiles at both time points of salt stress as compared with the empty-vector control. After 30 min of salt stress, nine genes were differentially expressed in  ami -13.3 roots, of which three genes, i.e.  AHA1 ,  HKT8  and  CaCA  (Os12g42910), showed a similar response in the empty-vector control plants. Similarly, after 3 h of salt stress, we found 16 and 21 genes to be differentially expressed in  ami -13.3 and empty-vector control, respectively. Eight genes shared a similar behaviour, including e.g.  MPK15 ,  MAP3K.15 ,  CIPK4 ,  TIP2-1  and  TIP4-2  (Table  1 ). Overall, these results suggest a temporal misregulation of the expressional network in  hsfc1b and ami -13.3 lines.   Expressional response of salt stress-responsive genes in the different genotypes.  (A) Venn-diagram presentation of the overlap of differentially expressed genes in  hsfc1b ,  ami -13.3 and corresponding controls under salt stress. (B) Differentially expressed sHSP genes: (1) expression in  ami -13.3 roots compared with Nipponbare empty-vector control roots in the absence of salt stress; (2) expression in empty-vector control roots exposed to salt stress (100 mM NaCl, 30 min) compared with non-stressed roots; (3) expression in  ami -13.3 roots exposed to salt stress (100 mM NaCl, 30 min), compared with non-stressed roots. Values are presented as the relative expression level (log 2 FC) of three biological replicates. The values that are significantly different (≤−1 or ≥+1) from the respective control by Student's  t -test ( P  ≤ 0.05) are marked with a star (*).  Recently, 12  sHSP  genes were found to respond to salt stress in rice ( Sarkar  et al.  2009 ). Since HSFs potentially regulate  sHSP  gene expression under stress conditions, we tested the expression of these 12 genes in  ami -13.3 roots (Fig.  5 B). In the absence of salt stress,  Hsp23.6-MII  was already induced in  ami -13.3 compared to the Nipponbare empty-vector line. After 30 min of salt stress,  Hsp18.1-CII ,  Hsp23.2-ER  and  Hsp23.6-MII  were significantly induced in empty-vector roots, whereas  Hsp18.6-CIII  was downregulated. In addition to  Hsp23.2-ER  and  Hsp23.6-MII ,  Hsp16.9B-CI ,  Hsp19.0-CII  and  Hsp26.2-MI  also showed an increased expression in  ami -13.3 roots under salt stress. Like in empty-vector control plants,  Hsp18.6-CIII  was downregulated in  ami -13.3 under salt stress, whereas  Hsp18.1-CII  was not significantly affected. For  Hsp18.6-CIII  and  Hsp23.6-MII , we observed a stronger response in  ami -13.3 under salt stress than in empty-vector control roots. There was no significant change in the expression of  Hsp16.0-px ,  Hsp17.9A-CI ,  Hsp18.8-CV  and  Hsp24.0-MI  in  ami -13.3 or empty-vector control roots under salt stress.  OsHsfC1b possesses a nuclear localization signal upstream of the HR-A/B domain, but lacks a nuclear export signal ( Wang  et al.  2009 ). We cloned the open reading frame of OsHsfC1b downstream of GFP. When transiently expressed in  Arabidopsis  mesophyll cell protoplasts, the fluorescence signal was primarily detected in the nucleus and to a lesser extent in the cytoplasm (Fig.  1 B), consistent with a transcription factor function of OsHsfC1b. The nuclear localization of OsHsfC1b in the absence of stress indicates that a stress-dependent modification is not required for nuclear accumulation. In addition, unlike LpHsfA2 from tomato, whose physical interaction with LpHsfA1 is mandatory for its translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus ( Scharf  et al.  1998 ), nuclear translocation of OsHsfC1b may not be complex dependent, as transient expression of  35S::GFP:OsHsfC1b  in  Arabidopsis  protoplasts eliminates possible interactions with other rice HSFs. However, due to high sequence similarities between rice and  Arabidopsis  HSFs ( Wang  et al.  2009 ), we cannot exclude heteromeric complex formation of OsHsfC1b with  Arabidopsis  HSFs.  Heat shock factors have been shown to regulate developmental processes in animals ( Pirkkala  et al.  2001 ). In addition, HSF1 in mice has an impact on the immune system ( Inouye  et al.  2004 ), indicating a dual role of HSFs in development and survival. In  S. pombe , the disruption of HSF results in growth defects under normal temperature; furthermore, it can be functionally replaced by the single HSF present in  D. melanogaster , suggesting a general role of HSFs for the regulation of growth or development of eukaryotic organisms under non-stress conditions ( Gallo  et al.  1993 ). Transgenic  Arabidopsis  plants overexpressing  OsHsfA2e  from rice,  AtHsfA2  or  AtHsfA3  from  Arabidopsis , or  BhHsf1  from  Boea hygrometrica  display impaired growth phenotypes ( Ogawa  et al.  2007 ;  Yokotani  et al.  2008 ;  Yoshida  et al.  2008 ;  Zhu  et al.  2009 ). Interestingly, we observed retarded root and shoot growth for  hsfc1b  and knock-down lines of  OsHsfC1b  and a decreased biomass at the age of 4 weeks as compared with control plants under normal conditions (Fig.  3 ). Thus, in contrast to class A HSFs, OsHsfC1b acts as a positive regulator of growth under standard growth conditions. We therefore propose that class C HSFs play an opposite role to class A members in plant growth control. The  hsfc1b  T-DNA insertion line and the  ami RNA lines were established in the rice  japonica  cultivars Dongjin and Nipponbare, respectively. Irrespective of the genetic background, all lines exhibited stunted growth, indicating a conserved role of OsHsfC1b in growth control in the different cultivars.  Heat shock factors represent interaction points connecting multiple stress response pathways. Many of them display an expressional response to various stresses and for some HSFs, mainly class A members, an involvement in stress adaptation has been shown ( Ogawa  et al.  2007 ;  Banti  et al.  2010 ;  Chauhan  et al.  2011 ).  OsHsfC1b  has been reported to be induced by heat stress ( Hu  et al.  2009 ;  Wang  et al.  2009 ). Remarkably, of all class C genes,  OsHsfC1b  shows the strongest expression under cold stress, suggesting an involvement of class C HSFs in the cold stress response, with OsHsfC1b playing a prominent role ( Mittal  et al.  2009 ).  In this study, we examined the physiological role of OsHsfC1b in the response to non-thermal stress. We show that  OsHsfC1b  is salt-responsive in both Nipponbare and Dongjin backgrounds. Furthermore, the decrease of  OsHsfC1b  expression level results in a decreased salt tolerance, as determined by the growth inhibition in the  hsfc1b  and  ami -7.1 lines under salt stress (Fig.  4 A and B). Hence, OsHsfC1b contributes to salt stress tolerance, which is conserved between the two tested  japonica  cultivars. Its role in the response to salt stress is not restricted to the seedling stage, as 4-week-old  hsfc1b ,  ami- 13.3 and  ami -7.1 plants accumulated less biomass than wild-type or empty-vector control plants under salt stress (Fig.  4 C).  In addition to ion toxicity, osmotic stress develops in the course of salt stress. Seedlings of  hsfc1b  subjected to mannitol displayed a stronger reduction of shoot and root growth than the Dongjin wild type (Fig.  4 D). Since  OsHsfC1b  is induced by mannitol (Fig.  2 A), it might function as a regulator of an osmotic stress response by itself or in combination with salt stress, as shown for HsfA2 in  Arabidopsis  ( Ogawa  et al.  2007 ). Previously, it was reported that  OsHsfC1b  expression is induced by drought stress ( Hu  et al.  2009 ), which causes osmotic imbalance as well.  Abscisic acid acts as an important integrator of abiotic stress responses. For salt and osmotic stress, ABA-dependent and ABA-independent signalling pathways are known. The expressional network related to salt stress partially overlaps with those for drought, cold and ABA. The decreased expression of  OsHsfC1b  results in ABA hypersensitivity (Fig.  4 E and F). Interestingly, the promoter of  OsHsfC1b  contains three putative ABA-response elements (ABREs;  Mittal  et al.  2009 ) and we showed that its expression is highly induced by ABA (Fig.  2 A). These findings strongly support a role of OsHsfC1b in ABA response pathways or signalling. Abscisic acid hypersensitivity is often accompanied by hypersensitivity to salt and osmotic stress ( Borsani  et al.  2001 ;  Pandey  et al.  2005 ;  Zhu  et al.  2010 ). Thus, the salt and osmotic stress tolerance conferred by OsHsfC1b is most likely ABA-dependent. In addition to stress tolerance, ABA is involved in the regulation of plant growth and development. Abscisic acid hypersensitivity can cause growth retardation even in the absence of external ABA, as demonstrated by the  brx-2  mutant in  Arabidopsis , which displays retarded root growth, and  ABF3  and  ABF4  overexpressers, which show general growth defects under non-stress conditions ( Kang  et al.  2002 ;  Rodrigues  et al.  2009 ). Possibly, the impaired growth of  hsfc1b ,  ami -13.3 and  ami -7.1 lines under normal conditions is a consequence of an increased sensitivity to ABA. In the case of the  ami -7.1 line, the relative response to ABA was similar to that of the control, which might be due to the severe growth retardation under control conditions.  We performed expression profiling of 80 salt stress-related genes encoding signalling and ion homeostasis components in  hsfc1b  and  ami -13.3 lines (Table  1 ). Interestingly, decreased expression of  OsHsfC1b  already resulted in differential expression of salt-responsive genes under control conditions. Thus, in  hsfc1b , eight genes were induced and two genes were repressed in the absence of stress, relative to Dongjin. Notably, seven of them responded to salt stress in Dongjin wild-type roots. Similarly, in  ami -13.3 roots, six genes were differentially expressed compared with empty-vector control plants in the absence of stress, of which five genes were affected by salt stress in the control plants. These findings indicate that decreased expression of  OsHsfC1b  causes the constitutive activation of some genes of the salt stress-associated GRN. Nonetheless, although the reduced  OsHsfC1b  expression in  hsfc1b  and the  ami RNA lines resulted in the misregulation of salt stress-responsive genes, we observed only a small overlap of genes responding similarly in  hsfc1b  and  ami -13.3 (Fig.  5 A). One possible explanation for this difference is that Dongjin and Nipponbare (here represented by the empty-vector line) themselves differed regarding their expression response to salinity. In both cultivars we observed a differential expression of previously identified salt stress markers (R. Schmidt, MPIMP, Golm, Germany, unpubl. res.); however, there was only an overlap of seven genes with a similar response. Moreover, the number of salt stress-responsive genes in Nipponbare was almost twice as high as in Dongjin. Cultivars differing in stress tolerance exhibit contrasting expression profiles, as demonstrated for salt and drought stress, where increasing sensitivity is positively correlated with an increasing number of differentially expressed stress-related genes ( Walia  et al.  2005 ;  Degenkolbe  et al.  2009 ). Among  japonica  cultivars, Dongjin is considered to be more salt tolerant than Nipponbare ( Oh  et al.  2003 ;  Ferdose  et al.  2009 ) and we observed a greater reduction of root FW and DW of empty-vector control plants in the Nipponbare background as compared with Dongjin wild-type plants under salt stress (Fig.  4 C), fitting the observed expression of stress marker genes.   MAP3K.18  expression is induced by salt, drought, cold, and fungal and viral pathogens, and is therefore thought to be relevant for multiple stress responses ( Jung  et al.  2010 ). Remarkably,  MAP3K.18  exhibited a &gt;130-fold downregulation in  hsfc1b  compared with Dongjin wild type under control conditions, whereas in Dongjin its expression was downregulated by ∼20-fold under salt stress.  TIP2-1 , encoding a tonoplast-located aquaporin, was constitutively repressed in  hsfc1b  roots under control conditions. To a lesser extent,  TIP2-1  was found to be downregulated in Dongjin wild-type roots after 30 min of salt stress. Moreover, after 3 h of salt stress,  TIP2-1  expression in  hsfc1b  roots was &gt;20-fold reduced, whereas no altered expression was observed in Dongjin roots. Additionally, after 3 h of salt stress,  TIP2-1  was more strongly repressed in  ami -13.3 than in Nipponbare empty-vector control plants. Consistent with our data,  TIP2-1  expression appears to be correlated with salt tolerance, as salt tolerant cultivars display an eight times higher expression level of  TIP2-1  in roots than salt-sensitive cultivars ( Cotsaftis  et al.  2011 ). Interestingly, we observed upregulation of  PIP2-2  expression in the empty-vector control line but not in  ami -13.3 upon salt stress, which might be causative for the differences between both lines regarding salt tolerance, as transgenic  Arabidopsis  plants overexpressing rice  PIP2-2  are more tolerant to salt and osmotic stress ( Guo  et al.  2006 ). Besides  PIP2-2, PIP1-3  was found to be induced in the empty-vector control after 30 min of salt stress, but was not changed in  ami -13.3 under stress conditions. Like  PIP2-2 ,  PIP1-3  might confer salt tolerance, since its expression is induced by salt, and rice plants overexpressing  PIP1-3  display an enhanced chilling and drought stress tolerance ( Lian  et al.  2004 ;  Guo  et al.  2006 ;  Matsumoto  et al.  2009 ). In addition to aquaporins, we tested the expression of ion transporters. HKT1 (OsHKT2;1) functions as a high-affinity Na +  transporter in rice roots and root sodium influx during salt stress is prevented by downregulation of  HKT1  expression ( Golldack  et al.  2002 ;  Horie  et al.  2007 ). However, in contrast to Dongjin wild-type roots,  HKT1  expression was not downregulated in  hsfc1b  roots upon salt stress, which might cause an accumulation of sodium ions in the root. Similar to a previous study ( Cotsaftis  et al.  2011 ), we did not find a correlation between  HKT8  ( OsHKT1;5 ) expression and salt tolerance, as  HKT8  expression was induced in both Dongjin wild-type and  hsfc1b  roots under salt stress. Still,  HKT8  was more strongly induced under salt stress in  ami -13.3 than the empty-vector control line, which might reflect the increased sensitivity of  ami -13.3 to salt stress. Furthermore, we observed a stronger reduction of  CIPK6  expression in  ami -13.3; in accordance with this, a positive correlation between  CIPK6  expression and salt tolerance was previously reported ( Cotsaftis  et al . 2011 ). Thus, in addition to the temporal misregulation of genes upon salt stress, the expression levels of individual marker genes strongly support the reduced salt tolerance observed for the  hsfc1b  and  ami RNA lines.  The heat shock element (HSE) is found in promoters of  sHSP  genes, suggesting a transcriptional control via HSFs ( Scharf  et al.  2001 ). Furthermore, HsfA2 in  Arabidopsis  has been shown to regulate the expression of several  sHSP  genes by binding to HSEs in the target gene promoters ( Schramm  et al.  2006 ). We tested the expression of 12 previously identified salt-responsive rice  sHSP  genes ( Sarkar  et al.  2009 ) in roots of salt-stressed  ami -13.3 plants (Fig.  5 B). Interestingly, we observed altered  sHSP  gene expression within 30 min of salt stress, indicating a rapid expressional response of the heat-shock network to non-thermal stresses. Similar to salt stress-related genes encoding signalling and ion homeostasis components, decreased  OsHsfC1b  expression causes a partial activation of the heat-shock expression network in the absence of stress (Fig.  5 B). Under salt stress,  ami -13.3 plants showed more and stronger responding  sHSP  genes. The increased response of  sHSP  genes in  ami -13.3 indicates a regulatory function of OsHsfC1b in the heat-shock expressional network; however, whether OsHsfC1b interacts with these  sHSP  genes in a direct or an indirect manner has to be determined. Our findings suggest that an enhanced response of the heat-shock expressional network under salt stress does not necessarily improve stress tolerance.  OsHsfC1b is, to our knowledge, the first class C HSF characterized  in planta . Its dual role in salt tolerance and plant growth illustrates the contribution of class C HSFs to these important aspects. Transgenic rice overexpressing  OsHsfC1b  might be relevant for future breeding strategies, as decreased expression of  OsHsfC1b  causes salt sensitivity and impaired growth under normal conditions. Identifying direct interactions between OsHsfC1b and  cis -regulatory elements of stress-related target genes is of further interest, as OsHsfC1b has been reported not to bind to the typical HSE element ( Mittal  et al.  2011 ). In addition to its eminent role as a food source, rice serves as an important model plant. Thus, the knowledge gained here for a class C HSF transcription factor could form the basis for the characterization of similar regulators in other monocotyledonous species. Of note, the relevance of OsHsfC1b in stress adaptation and growth demonstrated for two rice cultivars suggests that the function of class C HSFs is conserved within, and possibly also between, species.
