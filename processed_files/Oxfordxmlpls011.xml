describes the functional analysis of a class C heat shock transcription factor from rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>). OsHsfC1b is shown to play a role in ABA-mediated salt stress tolerance and is required for plant growth under non-stress conditions.Salt stress leads to attenuated growth and productivity in rice. Transcription factors like heat shock factors (HSFs) represent central regulators of stress adaptation. Heat shock factors of the classes A and B are well established as regulators of thermal and non-thermal stress responses in plants; however, the role of class C HSFs is unknown. Here we characterized the function of the OsHsfC1b (Os01g53220) transcription factor from rice.We analysed the expression of <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> in the rice <italic>japonica</italic> cultivars Dongjin and Nipponbare exposed to salt stress as well as after mannitol, abscisic acid (ABA) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. For functional characterization of OsHsfC1b, we analysed the physiological response of a T-DNA insertion line (<italic>hsfc1b</italic>) and two <italic>artificial micro</italic>-RNA (<italic>ami</italic>RNA) knock-down lines to salt, mannitol and ABA treatment. In addition, we quantified the expression of <italic>small Heat Shock Protein</italic> (<italic>sHSP</italic>) genes and those related to signalling and ion homeostasis by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in roots exposed to salt. The subcellular localization of OsHsfC1b protein fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) was determined in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mesophyll cell protoplasts.Expression of <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> was induced by salt, mannitol and ABA, but not by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Impaired function of <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> in the <italic>hsfc1b</italic> mutant and the <italic>ami</italic>RNA lines led to decreased salt and osmotic stress tolerance, increased sensitivity to ABA, and temporal misregulation of salt-responsive genes involved in signalling and ion homeostasis. Furthermore, <italic>sHSP</italic> genes showed enhanced expression in knock-down plants under salt stress. We observed retarded growth of <italic>hsfc1b</italic> and knock-down lines in comparison with control plants under non-stress conditions. Transient expression of OsHsfC1b fused to GFP in protoplasts revealed nuclear localization of the transcription factor.OsHsfC1b plays a role in ABA-mediated salt stress tolerance in rice. Furthermore, OsHsfC1b is involved in the response to osmotic stress and is required for plant growth under non-stress conditions.Rice represents a major food source for more than half of the world's population. Among crops, rice exhibits the least, wheat a moderate and barley the strongest tolerance to salt stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C37">Munns and Tester 2008</xref>). One reason for the low tolerance of rice to salinity is the high permeability of its roots to sodium ions. Sodium ions can easily enter the apoplast and subsequently rapidly lead to toxic intracellular concentrations. Since an increasing land area is affected by high salinity, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying salt tolerance of crops is of great societal and economic interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C62">Yan <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C40">Obata <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C14">Hadiarto and Tran 2011</xref>). The response to salt stress includes expressional changes of stress-related genes, which among others encode protein kinases, ion transporters and transcription factors. In rice, several transcription factor families (e.g. MYB, NAC, bZIP and AP2/ERF) contribute to stress adaptation by regulating the expression of stress-responsive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C17">Hu <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C18">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C31">Ma <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C58">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C16">Hossain <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C45">Park <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C56">Takasaki <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C32">Mallikarjuna <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C54">Song <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>).Heat shock factors (HSFs) are transcription factors that can structurally be classified into three classes: A, B and C. They consist of an N-terminal DNA-binding domain, an adjacent oligomerization domain (HR-A/B) and an additional class A-specific C-terminal activation domain containing aromatic, hydrophobic and acidic amino acid residues (AHA motif). In the HR-A/B domain, HSFs of the classes A and C harbour an inserted sequence of 21 and seven amino acid residues, respectively, which is absent from class B HSFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C39">Nover <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). In contrast to class A HSFs, class B HSFs act as transcriptional repressors while no clear activation or repression has been shown for class C HSFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C20">Ikeda <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). The number of HSF-encoding genes varies between plant species. The genome of the green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> contains two, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> 21 and rice 25 <italic>HSF</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C39">Nover <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C53">Schulz-Raffelt <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C13">Guo <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). In rice, 13 HSFs can be assigned to class A (including the subclasses A1, A2 and A4), eight HSFs to class B and four HSFs to class C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C13">Guo <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). Heat shock factors control gene expression by binding to the heat shock element, an inverted 5-bp repeat of the sequence ‘nGAAn’, found in the promoter regions of many heat-inducible genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C3">Barros <italic>et al.</italic> 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C55">Sun <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). Heat shock factors also function as regulators of other <italic>HSF</italic> genes, demonstrated by HsfA1d and HsfA1e from <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, which are involved in the expressional control of <italic>HsfA2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C38">Nishizawa-Yokoi <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Several HSFs of the classes A and B have been shown to play a role in the response to abiotic and biotic stresses. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, next to heat stress adaptation, HsfA2 controls the response to salt, osmotic stress, anoxia and submergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C41">Ogawa <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C2">Banti <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). HsfA1 in tomato functions as a master regulator of induced thermotolerance that cannot be replaced by any other HSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C34">Mishra <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). HsfB1 and HsfB2 from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> demonstrate the relevance of class B members in stress tolerance, as the knock-out of <italic>HsfB2</italic> and the double knock-out of both <italic>HSF</italic> genes result in improved pathogen resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C27">Kumar <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). The role of rice HSFs in stress adaptation is poorly understood. To date, two class A HSFs, i.e. OsHsfA2e and OsHsf7, have been functionally characterized <italic>in vivo</italic>. Transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants overexpressing <italic>OsHsfA2e</italic> are more tolerant to heat and salt stress than control plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C63">Yokotani <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>), and overexpression of <italic>OsHsf7</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> results in an increased thermotolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C30">Liu <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). The role of class C HSFs in stress response is currently unknown; however, expression patterns of class C <italic>HSF</italic> genes from rice suggest, in addition to a role in the heat shock response, a participation in non-thermal stress responses such as salt, drought and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C19">Hu <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C35">Mittal <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C58">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). In particular, <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> and <italic>OsHsf2b</italic> are highly responsive to salt and drought stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C19">Hu <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>).Besides stress, there is evidence for a role of HSFs in development. In animals and yeast, HSFs are involved in various non-stress processes, e.g. cell cycle progression, embryo development, cell differentiation and spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C46">Pirkkala <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). Loss of the transcriptional activator HSF1 in mice results in increased prenatal lethality, retarded growth and female sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C61">Xiao <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>). The corresponding homologue in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> is required for growth under control conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C10">Gallo <italic>et al.</italic> 1993</xref>), whereas in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> HSF regulates oogenesis and larva development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C22">Jedlicka <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>). Transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants overexpressing <italic>HsfA2</italic> exhibit increased cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C41">Ogawa <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>), which demonstrates the function of HSFs in plant growth control.In this study, we functionally characterized the class C <italic>HSF</italic> gene <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> from rice, which has been shown to be salt-responsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C19">Hu <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>). By using transgenic lines we show that it plays a dual role in both growth and tolerance to non-thermal stresses.Proteins homologous to OsHsfC1b were identified by BLAST searches on <uri xlink:href="http://www.phytozome.net/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.phytozome.net/</uri>. Multiple sequence alignment was done with Clustal X 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C28">Larkin <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>).Seeds of transgenic rice lines (<italic>hsfc1b</italic>, <italic>ami</italic>-7.1, <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 and empty-vector control) and wild-type (Dongjin) plants were placed on hydroponic boxes with full-strength Yoshida medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C64">Yoshida <italic>et al.</italic> 1971</xref>) using styrofoam adaptors. Plants grown for 3 or 4 weeks at (day/night) 26/22 °C, 75/70 % relative humidity with a day length of 12 h and a light intensity of 700 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>–1</sup> were subjected to salt stress by adding either 50 or 100 mM NaCl (final concentration) to the growth medium. Furthermore, hydroponically grown plants were treated with 100 mM mannitol, 5 µM abscisic acid (ABA) or 5 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. T<sub>1</sub> seeds of <italic>ami</italic>RNA and empty-vector lines were selected on 40 mg/L hygromycin. Leaves and roots were harvested separately. For estimation of biomass accumulation, fresh and dry weights of shoots and roots of five replicates each (from four plants in each experiment) were measured. After measurement, tissues were oven dried at 70 °C for 3 days, and the dry weight of each sample was measured. Subsequently, the relative biomass of the samples was calculated as the percentage of non-stressed plants.Dehulled seeds were surface sterilized with 12 % NaOCl for 5 min and washed five times with distilled water. Subsequently, seeds were sown on vertical plates with Murashige–Skoog (MS) medium (3 % sucrose) containing NaCl (50 or 100 mM), ABA (1 or 5 µM) or mannitol (100 mM). Plates were incubated at (day/night) 26/22 °C, 75/70 % relative humidity with a day length of 12 h. Light intensity was set to 700 µmol m<sup>–2</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>.The T-DNA insertion line 1B-09127.R (rice ssp. <italic>japonica</italic> cv.

Homozygous T<sub>2</sub> plants were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the primers 5′-CTCCTCCATGCCCCTCTG-3′ and 5′-TTGGGGTTTCTACAGGACGTAAC-3′ for detection of the mutant allele, and the primers 5′-CTGCTCTCATACGGAGGAGG-3′ and 5′-AAGACAGCAGCAACGGAAAG-3′ for wild-type allele detection.

As shown for <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic>, <italic>OsHsfC1a</italic> was significantly induced by salt stress in Dongjin roots (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS011F2">2</xref>B).For functional characterization of <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic>, we identified a homozygous T-DNA insertion line (1B-09127.R) in the Dongjin background and named it <italic>hsfc1b</italic>. The insertion site is located in the second exon of <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS011F2">2</xref>D). Additionally, we generated <italic>ami</italic>RNA lines in the Nipponbare background and selected two independent lines, <italic>ami</italic>-7.1 and <italic>ami</italic>-13.3, for further characterization. Transgenic plants of the T<sub>4</sub> (<italic>hsfc1b</italic>) and T<sub>1</sub> generation (<italic>ami</italic>RNA lines) were analysed regarding the expression of <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> under non-stress conditions. In <italic>hsfc1b</italic> roots, we observed an 11-fold reduction of <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> expression, while in <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 roots the expression of <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> was decreased by ∼5-fold as compared with control plants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS011F2">2</xref>E). The transcript of <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> was not detectable in roots of the <italic>ami</italic>-7.1 line. Notably, during salt stress <italic>OsHsfC1a</italic> expression in the insertion line was similar to that in the wild type, suggesting that <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> and <italic>OsHsfC1a</italic> act independently during the stress response [see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/pls011/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">Additional Information—File 2</ext-link>].<bold>Impact of OsHsfC1b on vegetative growth under normal conditions.</bold> (A) Seven-day-old seedlings grown on MS medium.

DAS, days after sowing.Osmotic stress alone or in combination with salt or drought stress leads to diminished cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C37">Munns and Tester 2008</xref>). <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> expression is induced in Nipponbare roots exposed to mannitol (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS011F2">2</xref>A). For this reason, we tested the tolerance of <italic>hsfc1b</italic> plants to osmotic stress (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS011F4">4</xref>D). At 4 DAS, <italic>hsfc1b</italic> plants grown on MS medium containing 100 mM mannitol exhibited significantly greater reduced shoot and root lengths, and at 7 DAS a significantly greater reduced root length as compared with the stressed wild type was observed, suggesting a role of OsHsfC1b in the response to osmotic stress (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS011F4">4</xref>D).Abscisic acid is involved in the response to many abiotic and biotic stresses, and exogenous ABA mimics effects caused by environmental stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C66">Zhu 2002</xref>). The expression of <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> is ABA-inducible (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS011F2">2</xref>A), suggesting a potential role in ABA signalling and/or response. Seedlings of <italic>hsfc1b</italic> showed hypersensitivity towards ABA (1 and 5 µM), visible by diminished shoot and root length at 7 DAS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS011F4">4</xref>E); this hypersensitivity was more prominent at 5 µM ABA. Seedlings of <italic>ami</italic>-7.1 and <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 had major problems in growing on 5 µM ABA, making a quantitative analysis impossible (data not shown). Therefore, we examined these parameters at 1 µM ABA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS011F4">4</xref>F). Whereas the <italic>ami</italic>-7.1 and the empty-vector control line showed a similar reduction of shoot and root length, those of <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 were significantly more affected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS011F4">4</xref>F).Expression of genes encoding signalling and ion homeostasis components in <italic>hsfc1b</italic> and <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 lines. Comparison of expression levels (log<sub>2</sub>FC) in roots of hsfc1b, <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 and their respective controls under non-stress and salt stress conditions (100 mM NaCl). Values are presented as the relative expression level (log<sub>2</sub>FC) of three biological replicates. The values that are significantly different from control (ΔΔ<italic>C</italic><sub>T</sub> ≤ −1 or ≥+1) by Student's <italic>t</italic>-test are in bold (<italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05).FC, fold change; EV, empty-vector control; n.d., not determined.After 30 min of salt stress, 13 genes were differentially expressed in Dongjin, six of which matched genes that were also differentially expressed in <italic>hsfc1b</italic> compared with the wild type under control conditions, including <italic>ECA1</italic>, <italic>AHA1</italic>, <italic>VHA-c4</italic>, <italic>HKT8</italic>, <italic>GLR2.7</italic> and <italic>TIP2-1</italic>, suggesting that the salt stress-associated gene regulatory network (GRN) is already in part activated in <italic>hsfc1b</italic> even in the absence of salt stress. A similar observation was made when <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 was compared with empty-vector control plants. After 30 min of salt stress, 15 genes responded in empty-vector control plants including four genes, i.e. <italic>MAP3K.4</italic>, <italic>MAP3K.18</italic>, <italic>CBL7</italic> and <italic>HAK4</italic>, which were differentially expressed in <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 under control conditions (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLS011TB1">1</xref>). Exposure of <italic>hsfc1b</italic> roots to salt stress for 30 min induced nine genes which did not overlap with the genes responding in Dongjin wild-type roots at this time point. After 3 h of salt stress, seven and 13 genes were differentially expressed in Dongjin and <italic>hsfc1b</italic> roots, respectively. The only overlapping gene at this time point was <italic>TIP3-2</italic>; five other genes responding in <italic>hsfc1b</italic> under salt stress overlapped with the 30-min time point for wild-type plants (<italic>MAP3K.23</italic>, <italic>CBL7</italic>, <italic>HKT8, CaCA/</italic>Os11g01580 and <italic>TIP2-1</italic>)<italic>.</italic> Furthermore, <italic>CNGC2</italic> (Os03g55100) showed a strong induction in Dongjin roots after 3 h, but was already induced in <italic>hsfc1b</italic> after 30 min of salt stress. For <italic>ami</italic>-13.3, we observed diverging expression profiles at both time points of salt stress as compared with the empty-vector control. After 30 min of salt stress, nine genes were differentially expressed in <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 roots, of which three genes, i.e. <italic>AHA1</italic>, <italic>HKT8</italic> and <italic>CaCA</italic> (Os12g42910), showed a similar response in the empty-vector control plants. Similarly, after 3 h of salt stress, we found 16 and 21 genes to be differentially expressed in <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 and empty-vector control, respectively. Eight genes shared a similar behaviour, including e.g. <italic>MPK15</italic>, <italic>MAP3K.15</italic>, <italic>CIPK4</italic>, <italic>TIP2-1</italic> and <italic>TIP4-2</italic> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLS011TB1">1</xref>). Overall, these results suggest a temporal misregulation of the expressional network in <italic>hsfc1b and ami</italic>-13.3 lines.<bold>Expressional response of salt stress-responsive genes in the different genotypes.</bold> (A) Venn-diagram presentation of the overlap of differentially expressed genes in <italic>hsfc1b</italic>, <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 and corresponding controls under salt stress.

Values are presented as the relative expression level (log<sub>2</sub>FC) of three biological replicates. The values that are significantly different (≤−1 or ≥+1) from the respective control by Student's <italic>t</italic>-test (<italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05) are marked with a star (*).Recently, 12 <italic>sHSP</italic> genes were found to respond to salt stress in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C49">Sarkar <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Since HSFs potentially regulate <italic>sHSP</italic> gene expression under stress conditions, we tested the expression of these 12 genes in <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 roots (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS011F5">5</xref>B). In the absence of salt stress, <italic>Hsp23.6-MII</italic> was already induced in <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 compared to the Nipponbare empty-vector line. After 30 min of salt stress, <italic>Hsp18.1-CII</italic>, <italic>Hsp23.2-ER</italic> and <italic>Hsp23.6-MII</italic> were significantly induced in empty-vector roots, whereas <italic>Hsp18.6-CIII</italic> was downregulated. In addition to <italic>Hsp23.2-ER</italic> and <italic>Hsp23.6-MII</italic>, <italic>Hsp16.9B-CI</italic>, <italic>Hsp19.0-CII</italic> and <italic>Hsp26.2-MI</italic> also showed an increased expression in <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 roots under salt stress. Like in empty-vector control plants, <italic>Hsp18.6-CIII</italic> was downregulated in <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 under salt stress, whereas <italic>Hsp18.1-CII</italic> was not significantly affected. For <italic>Hsp18.6-CIII</italic> and <italic>Hsp23.6-MII</italic>, we observed a stronger response in <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 under salt stress than in empty-vector control roots. There was no significant change in the expression of <italic>Hsp16.0-px</italic>, <italic>Hsp17.9A-CI</italic>, <italic>Hsp18.8-CV</italic> and <italic>Hsp24.0-MI</italic> in <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 or empty-vector control roots under salt stress.OsHsfC1b possesses a nuclear localization signal upstream of the HR-A/B domain, but lacks a nuclear export signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C58">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). We cloned the open reading frame of OsHsfC1b downstream of GFP. When transiently expressed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mesophyll cell protoplasts, the fluorescence signal was primarily detected in the nucleus and to a lesser extent in the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS011F1">1</xref>B), consistent with a transcription factor function of OsHsfC1b. The nuclear localization of OsHsfC1b in the absence of stress indicates that a stress-dependent modification is not required for nuclear accumulation. In addition, unlike LpHsfA2 from tomato, whose physical interaction with LpHsfA1 is mandatory for its translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C50">Scharf <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>), nuclear translocation of OsHsfC1b may not be complex dependent, as transient expression of <italic>35S::GFP:OsHsfC1b</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protoplasts eliminates possible interactions with other rice HSFs. However, due to high sequence similarities between rice and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> HSFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C58">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>), we cannot exclude heteromeric complex formation of OsHsfC1b with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> HSFs.Heat shock factors have been shown to regulate developmental processes in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C46">Pirkkala <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). In addition, HSF1 in mice has an impact on the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C21">Inouye <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>), indicating a dual role of HSFs in development and survival. In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, the disruption of HSF results in growth defects under normal temperature; furthermore, it can be functionally replaced by the single HSF present in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, suggesting a general role of HSFs for the regulation of growth or development of eukaryotic organisms under non-stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C10">Gallo <italic>et al.</italic> 1993</xref>). Transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants overexpressing <italic>OsHsfA2e</italic> from rice, <italic>AtHsfA2</italic> or <italic>AtHsfA3</italic> from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, or <italic>BhHsf1</italic> from <italic>Boea hygrometrica</italic> display impaired growth phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C41">Ogawa <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C63">Yokotani <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C65">Yoshida <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C67">Zhu <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Interestingly, we observed retarded root and shoot growth for <italic>hsfc1b</italic> and knock-down lines of <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> and a decreased biomass at the age of 4 weeks as compared with control plants under normal conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS011F3">3</xref>). Thus, in contrast to class A HSFs, OsHsfC1b acts as a positive regulator of growth under standard growth conditions. We therefore propose that class C HSFs play an opposite role to class A members in plant growth control. The <italic>hsfc1b</italic> T-DNA insertion line and the <italic>ami</italic>RNA lines were established in the rice <italic>japonica</italic> cultivars Dongjin and Nipponbare, respectively. Irrespective of the genetic background, all lines exhibited stunted growth, indicating a conserved role of OsHsfC1b in growth control in the different cultivars.Heat shock factors represent interaction points connecting multiple stress response pathways. Many of them display an expressional response to various stresses and for some HSFs, mainly class A members, an involvement in stress adaptation has been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C41">Ogawa <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C2">Banti <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C6">Chauhan <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> has been reported to be induced by heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C19">Hu <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C58">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Remarkably, of all class C genes, <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> shows the strongest expression under cold stress, suggesting an involvement of class C HSFs in the cold stress response, with OsHsfC1b playing a prominent role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C35">Mittal <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>).In this study, we examined the physiological role of OsHsfC1b in the response to non-thermal stress. We show that <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> is salt-responsive in both Nipponbare and Dongjin backgrounds. Furthermore, the decrease of <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> expression level results in a decreased salt tolerance, as determined by the growth inhibition in the <italic>hsfc1b</italic> and <italic>ami</italic>-7.1 lines under salt stress (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS011F4">4</xref>A and B). Hence, OsHsfC1b contributes to salt stress tolerance, which is conserved between the two tested <italic>japonica</italic> cultivars. Its role in the response to salt stress is not restricted to the seedling stage, as 4-week-old <italic>hsfc1b</italic>, <italic>ami-</italic>13.3 and <italic>ami</italic>-7.1 plants accumulated less biomass than wild-type or empty-vector control plants under salt stress (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS011F4">4</xref>C).In addition to ion toxicity, osmotic stress develops in the course of salt stress. Seedlings of <italic>hsfc1b</italic> subjected to mannitol displayed a stronger reduction of shoot and root growth than the Dongjin wild type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS011F4">4</xref>D). Since <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> is induced by mannitol (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS011F2">2</xref>A), it might function as a regulator of an osmotic stress response by itself or in combination with salt stress, as shown for HsfA2 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C41">Ogawa <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). Previously, it was reported that <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> expression is induced by drought stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C19">Hu <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>), which causes osmotic imbalance as well.Abscisic acid acts as an important integrator of abiotic stress responses. For salt and osmotic stress, ABA-dependent and ABA-independent signalling pathways are known. The expressional network related to salt stress partially overlaps with those for drought, cold and ABA. The decreased expression of <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> results in ABA hypersensitivity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS011F4">4</xref>E and F). Interestingly, the promoter of <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> contains three putative ABA-response elements (ABREs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C35">Mittal <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>) and we showed that its expression is highly induced by ABA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS011F2">2</xref>A). These findings strongly support a role of OsHsfC1b in ABA response pathways or signalling. Abscisic acid hypersensitivity is often accompanied by hypersensitivity to salt and osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C4">Borsani <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C44">Pandey <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C68">Zhu <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). Thus, the salt and osmotic stress tolerance conferred by OsHsfC1b is most likely ABA-dependent. In addition to stress tolerance, ABA is involved in the regulation of plant growth and development. Abscisic acid hypersensitivity can cause growth retardation even in the absence of external ABA, as demonstrated by the <italic>brx-2</italic> mutant in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, which displays retarded root growth, and <italic>ABF3</italic> and <italic>ABF4</italic> overexpressers, which show general growth defects under non-stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C25">Kang <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C47">Rodrigues <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Possibly, the impaired growth of <italic>hsfc1b</italic>, <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 and <italic>ami</italic>-7.1 lines under normal conditions is a consequence of an increased sensitivity to ABA. In the case of the <italic>ami</italic>-7.1 line, the relative response to ABA was similar to that of the control, which might be due to the severe growth retardation under control conditions.We performed expression profiling of 80 salt stress-related genes encoding signalling and ion homeostasis components in <italic>hsfc1b</italic> and <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 lines (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="PLS011TB1">1</xref>). Interestingly, decreased expression of <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> already resulted in differential expression of salt-responsive genes under control conditions. Thus, in <italic>hsfc1b</italic>, eight genes were induced and two genes were repressed in the absence of stress, relative to Dongjin. Notably, seven of them responded to salt stress in Dongjin wild-type roots. Similarly, in <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 roots, six genes were differentially expressed compared with empty-vector control plants in the absence of stress, of which five genes were affected by salt stress in the control plants. These findings indicate that decreased expression of <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> causes the constitutive activation of some genes of the salt stress-associated GRN. Nonetheless, although the reduced <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> expression in <italic>hsfc1b</italic> and the <italic>ami</italic>RNA lines resulted in the misregulation of salt stress-responsive genes, we observed only a small overlap of genes responding similarly in <italic>hsfc1b</italic> and <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS011F5">5</xref>A). One possible explanation for this difference is that Dongjin and Nipponbare (here represented by the empty-vector line) themselves differed regarding their expression response to salinity. In both cultivars we observed a differential expression of previously identified salt stress markers (R. Schmidt, MPIMP, Golm, Germany, unpubl. res.); however, there was only an overlap of seven genes with a similar response. Moreover, the number of salt stress-responsive genes in Nipponbare was almost twice as high as in Dongjin. Cultivars differing in stress tolerance exhibit contrasting expression profiles, as demonstrated for salt and drought stress, where increasing sensitivity is positively correlated with an increasing number of differentially expressed stress-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C57">Walia <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C8">Degenkolbe <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Among <italic>japonica</italic> cultivars, Dongjin is considered to be more salt tolerant than Nipponbare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C42">Oh <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C9">Ferdose <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>) and we observed a greater reduction of root FW and DW of empty-vector control plants in the Nipponbare background as compared with Dongjin wild-type plants under salt stress (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS011F4">4</xref>C), fitting the observed expression of stress marker genes.<italic>MAP3K.18</italic> expression is induced by salt, drought, cold, and fungal and viral pathogens, and is therefore thought to be relevant for multiple stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C24">Jung <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). Remarkably, <italic>MAP3K.18</italic> exhibited a &gt;130-fold downregulation in <italic>hsfc1b</italic> compared with Dongjin wild type under control conditions, whereas in Dongjin its expression was downregulated by ∼20-fold under salt stress. <italic>TIP2-1</italic>, encoding a tonoplast-located aquaporin, was constitutively repressed in <italic>hsfc1b</italic> roots under control conditions. To a lesser extent, <italic>TIP2-1</italic> was found to be downregulated in Dongjin wild-type roots after 30 min of salt stress. Moreover, after 3 h of salt stress, <italic>TIP2-1</italic> expression in <italic>hsfc1b</italic> roots was &gt;20-fold reduced, whereas no altered expression was observed in Dongjin roots. Additionally, after 3 h of salt stress, <italic>TIP2-1</italic> was more strongly repressed in <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 than in Nipponbare empty-vector control plants. Consistent with our data, <italic>TIP2-1</italic> expression appears to be correlated with salt tolerance, as salt tolerant cultivars display an eight times higher expression level of <italic>TIP2-1</italic> in roots than salt-sensitive cultivars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C7">Cotsaftis <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Interestingly, we observed upregulation of <italic>PIP2-2</italic> expression in the empty-vector control line but not in <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 upon salt stress, which might be causative for the differences between both lines regarding salt tolerance, as transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants overexpressing rice <italic>PIP2-2</italic> are more tolerant to salt and osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C12">Guo <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). Besides <italic>PIP2-2, PIP1-3</italic> was found to be induced in the empty-vector control after 30 min of salt stress, but was not changed in <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 under stress conditions. Like <italic>PIP2-2</italic>, <italic>PIP1-3</italic> might confer salt tolerance, since its expression is induced by salt, and rice plants overexpressing <italic>PIP1-3</italic> display an enhanced chilling and drought stress tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C29">Lian <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C12">Guo <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C33">Matsumoto <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). In addition to aquaporins, we tested the expression of ion transporters. HKT1 (OsHKT2;1) functions as a high-affinity Na<sup>+</sup> transporter in rice roots and root sodium influx during salt stress is prevented by downregulation of <italic>HKT1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C11">Golldack <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C15">Horie <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). However, in contrast to Dongjin wild-type roots, <italic>HKT1</italic> expression was not downregulated in <italic>hsfc1b</italic> roots upon salt stress, which might cause an accumulation of sodium ions in the root. Similar to a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C7">Cotsaftis <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>), we did not find a correlation between <italic>HKT8</italic> (<italic>OsHKT1;5</italic>) expression and salt tolerance, as <italic>HKT8</italic> expression was induced in both Dongjin wild-type and <italic>hsfc1b</italic> roots under salt stress. Still, <italic>HKT8</italic> was more strongly induced under salt stress in <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 than the empty-vector control line, which might reflect the increased sensitivity of <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 to salt stress. Furthermore, we observed a stronger reduction of <italic>CIPK6</italic> expression in <italic>ami</italic>-13.3; in accordance with this, a positive correlation between <italic>CIPK6</italic> expression and salt tolerance was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C7">Cotsaftis <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). Thus, in addition to the temporal misregulation of genes upon salt stress, the expression levels of individual marker genes strongly support the reduced salt tolerance observed for the <italic>hsfc1b</italic> and <italic>ami</italic>RNA lines.The heat shock element (HSE) is found in promoters of <italic>sHSP</italic> genes, suggesting a transcriptional control via HSFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C51">Scharf <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). Furthermore, HsfA2 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has been shown to regulate the expression of several <italic>sHSP</italic> genes by binding to HSEs in the target gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C52">Schramm <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). We tested the expression of 12 previously identified salt-responsive rice <italic>sHSP</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C49">Sarkar <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>) in roots of salt-stressed <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 plants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS011F5">5</xref>B). Interestingly, we observed altered <italic>sHSP</italic> gene expression within 30 min of salt stress, indicating a rapid expressional response of the heat-shock network to non-thermal stresses. Similar to salt stress-related genes encoding signalling and ion homeostasis components, decreased <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> expression causes a partial activation of the heat-shock expression network in the absence of stress (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLS011F5">5</xref>B). Under salt stress, <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 plants showed more and stronger responding <italic>sHSP</italic> genes. The increased response of <italic>sHSP</italic> genes in <italic>ami</italic>-13.3 indicates a regulatory function of OsHsfC1b in the heat-shock expressional network; however, whether OsHsfC1b interacts with these <italic>sHSP</italic> genes in a direct or an indirect manner has to be determined. Our findings suggest that an enhanced response of the heat-shock expressional network under salt stress does not necessarily improve stress tolerance.OsHsfC1b is, to our knowledge, the first class C HSF characterized <italic>in planta</italic>. Its dual role in salt tolerance and plant growth illustrates the contribution of class C HSFs to these important aspects. Transgenic rice overexpressing <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> might be relevant for future breeding strategies, as decreased expression of <italic>OsHsfC1b</italic> causes salt sensitivity and impaired growth under normal conditions. Identifying direct interactions between OsHsfC1b and <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements of stress-related target genes is of further interest, as OsHsfC1b has been reported not to bind to the typical HSE element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLS011C36">Mittal <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). In addition to its eminent role as a food source, rice serves as an important model plant. Thus, the knowledge gained here for a class C HSF transcription factor could form the basis for the characterization of similar regulators in other monocotyledonous species. Of note, the relevance of OsHsfC1b in stress adaptation and growth demonstrated for two rice cultivars suggests that the function of class C HSFs is conserved within, and possibly also between, species.<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/pls011/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">The following additional information is available in the online version of this article –</ext-link><bold>File 1.</bold> Table.
