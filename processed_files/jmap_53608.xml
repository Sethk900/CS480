New species and new combinations of Asian Batrisodes Reitter (Coleoptera, Staphylinidae, Pselaphinae), and synonymy of Batrisodellus Jeannel with BatrisodesContinuing surveys on the pselaphine fauna in China have revealed four undescribed species of the genus Batrisodes: Batrisodes angustelytratus sp. n. (with Pachycondyla ant) and B. longwangshanus sp. n. from Zhejiang, B. bamian sp. n. (with Pseudolasius ant) from Hunan, and B. songxiaobini sp. n. (with Formica ant) from Yunnan. The genus Batrisodellus is placed as a junior synonym of Batrisodes, syn. n.; this taxonomic act results in eight new combinations: Batrisodes cerberus, B. coprea, B. cristatus, B. fengtingae, B. laticollis, B. longulus, B. palpalis, and B. punctipennis. The Russian Far East species Basitrodes cornutus is transferred to Batrisodes, comb. n.
