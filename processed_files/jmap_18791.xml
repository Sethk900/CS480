Carbon storage of microbes and roots and the flux of CO2 across a moisture gradientLiving root biomass (tree roots less than or equal to 2 mm, tree roots >2 mm, and dwarf shrub roots), dead root biomass, microbial biomass carbon (C-mic), and soil surface CO2 flux were investigated in a northern boreal mixed forest. Three study sites were established along a 100-m gradient with differing moisture and soil texture. The amount of total root biomass did not differ across the moisture gradient. The amount of living root biomass averaged 1.46 kg.m(-2), and 1.04 kg.m(-2) was found as dead roots. Half of living root biomass was fine roots (diameter less than or equal to 2 mm), and of this fraction, 75% was fine roots of trees. The total amount of C-mic was lower on the dry site (78.5 g C.m(-2)) compared with the intermediate and mesic sites (95.3 g C.m(-2)). The C-mic to organic C ratio was 1.4% in the L+F+H horizon, and the ratio increased with increasing depth to 4.1% in the C horizon, which indicated that microbes in the deeper soil horizons decomposed recently deposited root litter or exudates. The storage of carbon in fine roots was four times more than that in C-mic. The soil surface CO2 flux fluctuated seasonally but was similar across the gradient.
