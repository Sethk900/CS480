Soil physico-chemical properties affecting the distribution of biological soil crusts along an environmental transect at Zapotitlán drylands, MexicoThe composition of cyanobacteria, mosses, and lichens of biological soil crusts were correlated with soil characteristics and sun exposure along an environmental transect. The study was conducted in Zapotitlán drylands, a locality within the Tehuacán–Cuicatlán Valley, central Mexico, where a great variety of environments for crust development exist due to landscape fragmentation. Data were analyzed with redundancy and Sorensen analysis. Soil crusts consisted of different combinations of cyanobacteria (7 species), mosses (19 species), and lichens (8 species). The relative frequencies of these groups were positively correlated with soil apparent density and lichens were also positively correlated with soil pH. However, there were no significant correlations with sun exposure.
