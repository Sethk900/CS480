Influence of Enhanced UV-B Radiation and Straw Application on Soil Respiration in Soybean FieldField experiment was carried out in 2008 in order to investigate the effects of enhanced UV-B radiation and straw application on soil respiration in soybean field. LI-8100 automated soil CO2 flux system was used to measure soil respiration under 20% enhanced UV-B radiation, straw application, 20% enhanced UV-B radiation + straw application and control. Environmental factors such as air temperature, soil temperature and moisture were also measured. Results indicated that supplemental UV-B radiation reduced soil respiration rate by 30.31%, straw application increased soil respiration rate by 14.51%, while enhanced UV-B radiation + straw application combined treatment had no significant effect on soil respiration. Enhanced UV-B radiation enhanced the carbon conversion rate of straw. Significant relationship were found between soil respiration rate and soil temperature under the control, enhanced UV-B, straw application, and enhanced UV-B + straw application, the fitting equation determined coefficients R-2 were 0.434, 0.563, 0.451 and 0.513. The Q(10) (temperature sensitivity coefficients) for soil respiration were 1.55, 1.91, 1.80 and 1.71, respectively. It was reflected that enhanced UV-B radiation, straw application and enhanced UV-B radiation + straw returning increased the Q(10) for soil respiration.
