The large number of disparate metrics used to quantify functional diversity reflects the range of attributes underlying this concept, generally summarized as functional richness, functional evenness, and functional divergence. However, in practice, we know very little about which attributes drive which ecosystem functions, due to a lack of field-based tests. Here we test the association between eight leading functional diversity metrics (Raoâ€™s Q, FD, FDis, FEve, FDiv, convex hull volume, and species and functional group richness) that emphasize different attributes of functional diversity, plus 11 extensions of these existing metrics that incorporate heterogeneous species abundances and trait variation. We assess the relationships among these metrics and compare their performances for predicting three key ecosystem functions (above- and belowground biomass and light capture) within a long-term grassland biodiversity experiment. Many metrics were highly correlated, although unique information was captured in FEve, FDiv, and dendrogram-based measures (FD) that were adjusted by abundance. FD adjusted by abundance outperformed all other metrics in predicting both above- and belowground biomass, although several others also performed well (e.g. Raoâ€™s Q, FDis, FDiv). More generally, trait-based richness metrics and hybrid metrics incorporating multiple diversity attributes outperformed evenness metrics and single-attribute metrics, results that were not changed when combinations of metrics were explored. For light capture, species richness alone was the best predictor, suggesting that traits for canopy architecture would be necessary to improve predictions. Our study provides a comprehensive test linking different attributes of functional diversity with ecosystem function for a grassland system.  Thus, there are many issues that remain unresolved in terms of the linkages between functional diversity and ecosystem function in real systems. We address several of these, centered around a single experiment, in an effort to synthesize greater understanding than a piecemeal approach would afford. Here we use long-term field data from a grassland biodiversity experiment to (1) test which attributes of functional diversity more closely describe two prominent ecosystem functions (aboveground biomass and light capture), and (2) incorporate into this test hybrid metrics, or augmentations to existing metrics, that incorporate heterogeneous variation among traits and abundance-weighting to FD and Convex Hulls. It is not the goal of this effort to find the best functional diversity metric for all systems or all processes, but rather to gain more understanding of which attributes of functional diversity, embodied to different degrees by different metrics, map to these two ecosystem functions.

Calculations are shown for a simplified community of three species with unequal abundances (abundance represented by the size of circles). Subscripts are for species i and trait j. Trait values for species are standardized to a mean of zero and standard deviation of one (Z-scores). Trait values for species are then multiplied by the proportional relative abundance (bound between zero and one), which results in a translation towards the origin, more so for rare species and less so for abundant species (see Appendix 1 for calculation). This modified distribution is then used for subsequent metric calculation. Weighing by the CV involves multiplying each standardized trait value by the CV (a positive value). This â€œstretchesâ€ trait axes with CV&gt;1, effectively spreading species further apart along that axis, and â€œcompressesâ€ trait axes with CV&lt;1, effectively crowding species closer together along that axis. We performed CV weighting prior to abundance weighting.  In addition to abundance weighting, we investigated how variance-weighting of trait values alters functional diversity metrics. To perform this adjustment, after traits were standardized (mean zero standard deviation unity) we multiplied the trait value for each species by the coefficient of variation (CV) of the raw trait data. This process â€œstretches outâ€ axes with a higher CV and â€œcompressesâ€ those with a lower CV, retains inter-species spacing, and emphasizes traits that have a higher degree of variation. We also performed this adjustment on Raoâ€™s Q for comparative purposes.

Comparisons are based on Akaike weights, with larger weights indicating greater relative strength of evidence for that predictor. Slopes are standardized and associated P-values are for significance of diversity metrics on aboveground biomass.

Summary of linear mixed-effects models for diversity metrics on light incident on the soil surface in the BioCON experiment. R 2  are shown for observed versus predicted values. Comparisons are based on Akaike weights, with larger weights indicating greater relative strength of evidence for that predictor. Slopes are standardized and associated P-values are for significance of diversity metrics on light not captured by the canopy.  One reason for these differences could be related to the size of trait space sampled in this experiment. Namely, that the multidimensional size of trait space sampled in our experiment (Minnesota prairie species) may have been demonstrably smaller than that in Mouillot et al (2011) (mid European hay meadow). In any generic community, as the total volume of trait-space occupied declines, the ratio of the multidimensional surface to volume increases. Thus, the potential explanatory power of richness measurements (the surface) should increase as the total trait volume sampled declines, a hypothesis that deserves testing. Because all species in our system are adapted to a fairly harsh environment, they represent a restricted subset of trait combinations already. Thus, we might expect functional richness estimates (like FDâ€™) to be larger in their relative explanatory power in simpler communities than metrics describing the filling of trait space.
