New records of Paraleptophlebia werneri Ulmer, 1920 and Paraleptophlebia strandii (Eaton, 1901) from Finland (Ephemeroptera, Leptophlebiidae)Abstract The mayfly species Paraleptophlebia werneri has been rediscovered from Finland. The species was classified as RE (regionally extinct) in the most recent national red-list assessment. The new locality is close to the Russian border in NE Lapland, Savukoski. Adult males were collected with a sweep net around a pond. Paraleptophlebia strandii is a rather poorly known but widespread Finnish species. The adults of this species occurred in great numbers in aapamires of central Lapland (Sodankyl√§). We hypothesize that these leptophlebid species are not dependent on running water but may instead thrive in small lentic water bodies.
