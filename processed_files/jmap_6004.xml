Initial studies on fungicide evaluation for efficacy in the management of Fusarium head blight in wheatThe efficacy of the fungicides bromuconazole, carbendazim/epoxiconazole, carbendazim/flusilazole, carbendazim, cypro- conazole, flutriafol, prochloraz, propiconazole and tebucona- zole in controlling head blight was determined in the greenhouse. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) spikes of cultivar SST 38 were inoculated at the onset of flowering with 2.6 × 105 spores. ml−1 of four isolates of Fusarium graminearum (Schwabe). Fungicides were applied either as three-day prior or three-day post-inoculation treatments. Inoculated plants were maintained in the greenhouse at a day/night temperature regime of 25/15°C. Data was captured at two-day intervals for 14 days commencing four days after inoculation. Bromuconazole, carbendazim/epoxiconazole, flutriafol, prochloraz, propiconazole and tebuconazole were most effective against head blight (P = 0.05) whereas carbendazim/flusilazole, carbendazim and cyproconazole did not differ from the unsprayed control. No difference was found between the pre- and the post-inoculation fungicide applications. Future trials will be conducted in the field in order to make recommendations to producers.
