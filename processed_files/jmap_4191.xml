Redescription and reâ€evaluation of the taxonomic status of the Neotropical copepod Diaptomus falcifer Daday, 1905 (Calanoida: Diaptomidae)Abstract Diaptomus sensu lato falcifer Daday is one of the several species of Neotropical diaptomids without a precise generic assignment and for which available descriptions are fragmentary and incomplete. On the basis of populations from Argentina and Paraguay, â€œDiaptomusâ€ falcifer Daday is redescribed. The variability of several diagnostic features is quantified and discussed. Moreover, several hitherto unknown aspects of the morphology are described. Relocation of Daday's species to the genus Argyrodiaptomus Brehm, and its synonymy with A. argentinus Wright are suggested.
