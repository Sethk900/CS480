Exceptional High Queen Production in the Brazilian Stingless Bee Plebeia remotaIn Plebeia remota only a few gynes (young virgin queens) are usually reared per year. However, in two laboratory colonies an extraordinarily high number of gynes emerged within a short period of time. These gynes were significantly smaller than those produced in low numbers by other colonies. Morphometric characters and behaviour of the gynes were recorded. Possible reasons for the phenomenon of exceptional high gyne production are discussed.
