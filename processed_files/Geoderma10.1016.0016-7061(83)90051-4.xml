 V    PREFACE    This special issue of Geoderma is the result of the work of members  of the "International Working-Group on Submicroscopy of Undisturbed  Soil Materials (IWGSUSM)". The papers are from the second workshop  of IWGSUSM, organized in 1981 by J. Ducloux at the University of Poitiers,  France; the symposium on "Submicroscopy of Undisturbed Soil Materials"  organized in 1981 by M.L. Thompson in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.A. during  the annual meeting of the Soil Science Socmty of America, and work done  in 1982. The papers mainly concern in situ electron microscopic studies  of materials in thin sections of softs and of unimpregnated soft constituents  in peds. Ion microscopy is discussed in one paper.  The plan to start IWGSUSM originated in 1975, but it was 1979 before  E.B.A. Bisdom could write the first circular letter. By this time sufficient  new submicroscopic techniques had been tested to allow detailed studies  of soil conshtuents in thin sections. One of the problems, then and now,  is however, that the costs of using electron microscopes, ion microscopes,  laser microprobe mass analyzers, etc. are rather high and that the inter-  pretation of data can be intricate. Consequently, an international organiza-  tion was founded to assess the significance of projects and to start cooper-  ative efforts. Such cooperation between specialized laboratories should  facilitate the study of intricate problems. Various specialists joined IWGSUSM,  i.e. soil mmromorphologlsts, soil physicists, soil chemists, engineers in soil  mechanics, geologtsts, geographers, biologists, etc. The first results of three  cooperative research projects, i.e. on soil pollution, the characterization of  orgamc matter in Vertisols, and the effects of the application of sewage  sludge and pig slurry on surface crusts of cultivated soils are discussed.  The first workshop of IWGSUSM was organized by E.B.A. Bisdom in  1980 at the Netherlands Soft Survey Institute, Wagenmgen, The Netherlands.  A book Submzcroscopy of Soils and Weathered Rocks contains papers  presented at this workshop plus introductory articles on techmques and  instruments used in submicroscopy, and review articles which discuss in  situ submicroscopic work done in soil science. The present special issue  of Geoderma, which will also appear as a book in the series "Developments  in Soil Science", gives various technical papers and practical applications  of submlcroscopy in soil science. Some papers discuss purely submicro-  scopic subjects, whereas submicroscopy is used in other papers as one  of a number of techniques.  Most submicroscopic studies start by using the light microscope to in-  vestigate soil constituents in thin sections and unhardened soil peds. Such  work is usually done by soil micromorphologlsts and specialists in, for  example, soil mechanics. Soil physicists are attracted by this type of in  sltu work because by using the combination of light microscopy and sub-  mmroscopy it can be seen where transported soil particles have been de-  posited in the soil profile -- especially under controlled experimental con-    0016--7061/83/$03.00 1983 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V    v1    ditlons -- and data on very free and larger pores (voids) can be collected  by using an image analyzer to study the porosity m mmrographs obtained  by light microscopy and electron microscopy. The soil chemist, who usually  works with wet chemistry and disturbed bulk samples, is attracted by  the m situ mmrochemical results obtamed from dry samples by various  submmroscopm  techmques.  Amorphous,  poorly crystalline and clayey  materials in thin sections will usually be of interest for the microanalysis  of chemical elements  Submicroscopy is a young fmld of soil science which can help different  speciahzatlons by giving various types of in situ information. IWGSUSM  was an independent organization until the end of 1982 and will form part  of the "Subcommission on Soil Micromorphology" of the "International  Socmty of Soil Science" in 1983.
