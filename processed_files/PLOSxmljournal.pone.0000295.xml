The biodiversity of ecosystems worldwide is changing because of species loss due to human-caused extinctions and species gain through intentional and accidental introductions. Here we show that the combined effect of these two processes is altering the trophic structure of food webs in coastal marine systems. This is because most extinctions (âˆ¼70%) occur at high trophic levels (top predators and other carnivores), while most invasions are by species from lower trophic levels (70% macroplanktivores, deposit feeders, and detritivores). These opposing changes thus alter the shape of marine food webs from a trophic pyramid capped by a diverse array of predators and consumers to a shorter, squatter configuration dominated by filter feeders and scavengers. The consequences of the simultaneous loss of diversity at top trophic levels and gain at lower trophic levels is largely unknown. However, current research suggests that a better understanding of how such simultaneous changes in diversity can impact ecosystem function will be required to manage coastal ecosystems and forecast future changes.  Arrows represent one group consuming the group to which the arrow points. Shading indicates trophic level (noneâ€Š=â€Š1, lightâ€Š=â€Š2, moderateâ€Š=â€Š3, darkâ€Š=â€Š4).  Colors indicate trophic level (whiteâ€Š=â€Š1, light greyâ€Š=â€Š2, dark greyâ€Š=â€Š3, blackâ€Š=â€Š4). Extinctions are skewed towards trophic levels 3 and 4 (secondary consumers and predators) while invasions are skewed towards trophic level 2 (primary consumers).  Bar widths are scaled to the proportion of species in each trophic level and numbers indicate percentage of species loss or gain in each trophic level. Colors indicate trophic level (whiteâ€Š=â€Š1, light greyâ€Š=â€Š2, dark greyâ€Š=â€Š3, blackâ€Š=â€Š4).

Note the dramatic reduction of the proportion of species in the top two trophic levels, and the increasing dominance of primary consumers.  We recognize that classification of some feeding groups into particular trophic levels is not straightforward given widespread omnivory. In particular, many benthic and pelagic planktivorous organisms are facultatively if not obligately omnivorous and thus could be considered â€œomnivorous consumersâ€ in trophic level three instead of in trophic level two where we placed them. As there were few zooplankton in our data set, we do not think that their classification in level two or three is likely to qualitatively alter the results. We retain the â€œmacroplanktivoresâ€ which are mostly benthic suspension feeders in trophic level 2 rather than 3 because the types of organisms that consume them are similar to those that consume other members of trophic level two (herbivores, detritivores) and these predators largely reside themselves within trophic level three. In other words, had we moved macroplanktivores to trophic level 3, we would have then shifted the species at trophic level 3 and 4 to levels 4 and 5. Thus the placement of planktivores in trophic level 2 or 3 would not fundamentally alter our conclusions.  Trophic skew was assessed using contingency analysis in R to compare the number of species in each trophic group (both trophic level and functional feeding group) in the list of species extinctions to each list of species invasions. Results of both analyses are presented and do not qualitatively differ.  (0.32 MB DOC)  (0.37 MB DOC)  (0.34 MB DOC)  (0.36 MB DOC)  (0.11 MB DOC)  (0.08 MB DOC)  Thanks to J.
