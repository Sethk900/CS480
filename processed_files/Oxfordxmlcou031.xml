Larval sturgeon swimming capacity has never been assessed. We measured critical swimming velocity of larval green and white sturgeon, and summarized published juvenile critical swimming velocity data for all sturgeon species. Recommendations for anthropogenic water diversion facility flow management were developed from the data, emphasizing Californian green and white sturgeon conservation.  Little is known of the swimming capacities of larval sturgeons, despite global population declines in many species due in part to fragmentation of their spawning and rearing habitats by man-made water-diversion structures. Larval green ( Acipenser medirostris ) and white sturgeon ( Acipenser transmontanus ) inhabit the highly altered Sacramentoâ€“San Joaquin watershed, making them logical species to examine vulnerability to entrainment by altered water flows. The risk of larval sturgeon entrainment is influenced by the ontogeny of swimming capacity and dispersal timing and their interactions with water-diversion structure operations. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe and compare the ontogeny and allometry of larval green and white sturgeon swimming capacities until completion of metamorphosis into juveniles. Despite the faster growth rates and eventual larger size of larval white sturgeon, green sturgeon critical swimming velocities remained consistently, though modestly, greater than those of white sturgeon throughout the larval life stage. Although behavioural interactions with water-diversion structures are also important considerations, regarding swimming capacity, Sacramentoâ€“San Joaquin sturgeons are most vulnerable to entrainment in Februaryâ€“May, when white sturgeon early larvae are in the middle Sacramento River, and Aprilâ€“May, when green sturgeon early larvae are in the upper river. Green sturgeon migrating downstream to the estuary and bays in Octoberâ€“November are also susceptible to entrainment due to their movements combined with seasonal declines in their swimming capacity. An additional inter-species comparison of the allometric relationship between critical swimming velocities and total length with several sturgeon species found throughout the world suggests a similar ontogeny of swimming capacity with growth. Therefore, although dispersal and behaviour differ among river systems and sturgeon species, similar recommendations are applicable for managers seeking to balance water demands with restoration and conservation of sturgeons worldwide.  Several sturgeon life-history traits, such as longevity, late maturation, spawning migrations and long breeding intervals, make sturgeon species worldwide vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures ( Rochard  et al. , 1990 ;  Billard and Lecointre, 2001 ;  Gessner  et al. , 2007 ;  Mussen  et al. , 2014 ). Many sturgeon species spend all or part of their lives in coastal and inland systems, where habitat fragmentation by dams and other water-diversion structures is pervasive ( Rochard  et al. , 1990 ;  Billard and Lecointre, 2001 ;  Williot  et al. , 2002 ). These structures can impede safe passage of migratory and resident fishes, interrupt watershed connectivity and adversely affect populations of many fish species ( Xenopoulos  et al. , 2005 ;  Arnekleiv  et al. , 2007 ;  Caudill  et al. , 2007 ;  Liermann  et al. , 2012 ), including sturgeons ( Liermann  et al. , 2012 ). The ability of fish to navigate or avoid water-diversion structures is related to their behavioural responses to water flow ( Hinch and Bratty, 2000 ) and swimming capacities ( Hoover  et al. , 2005 ;  Swanson  et al. , 2005 ;  Adams  et al. , 2007 ;  Boysen and Hoover, 2009 ). Sturgeons, in comparison to other anadromous fishes, may be particularly susceptible to altered flows around water-diversion structures due to their reduced swimming capacities ( Peake  et al. , 1997 ;  Deslauriers and Kieffer, 2012a ) and unique behavioural responses to flow ( Webb, 1986 ; Peake  et al.,  1997; Parsons  et al.,  2003; Hoover  et al.,  2005;  Deslauriers and Kieffer, 2012a ;  Mussen  et al. , 2014 ). Due to the pervasiveness of water diversion from sturgeon rivers worldwide and the protected status of all 27 sturgeon species by at least one international or national government body ( IUCN, 2014 ;  SARA, 2014 ;  USFWS, 2014 ), assessments of swimming abilities of sturgeons that encounter anthropogenic water-diversion structures are important to understanding potential impacts on sturgeon populations.  Green ( Acipenser medirostris ) and white sturgeon ( Acipenser transmontanus ) are anadromous and semi-anadromous fishes, respectively, that are protected in North America. Green sturgeon spawn in Oregon and California and are composed of at least two genetically distinct populations ( Israel  et al. , 2009b ). The Northern Distinct Population Segment (DPS), which is classified as a species of concern by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the USA, includes all populations that spawn in rivers north of the Eel River of northwest California ( Adams  et al. , 2007 ). Confirmed spawning locations for the Northern DPS are the Rogue River in Oregon and the Klamath River in northern California, though additional spawning locations are suspected ( Adams  et al. , 2007 ). The Southern DPS is classified as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and all suspected and confirmed spawning locations are within the Sacramentoâ€“San Joaquin (S-SJ) watershed in California ( Adams  et al. , 2007 ). A review of the current distribution of green sturgeon and the spawning locations of both the Northern and Southern DPS has been provided by  Beamesderfer  et al.  (2007) .  White sturgeon are found in three major North American drainages, i.e. Fraser, Columbia and S-SJ. Populations in the Kootenay, Upper Fraser, Nechako and Columbia rivers are protected by the Canadian Species at Risk Act ( SARA, 2014 ). The American ESA recognizes the Kootenay population as endangered, and though the S-SJ population is not classified, the American Fisheries Society identifies them as a conservation concern ( Musick  et al. , 2000 ). White sturgeon are less marine oriented, with more life-history variation compared with green sturgeon. For example, the Kootenay population is landlocked and appears to disperse downstream more slowly than all other white sturgeon populations, which are semi-anadromous ( McCabe and Tracy, 1993 ;  Kynard and Parker, 2005 ;  Kynard  et al. , 2010 ;  McAdam, 2011 ). Details on the populations and distribution of white sturgeon throughout their range have been provided by  Schreier  et al.  (2013) .  Green and white sturgeon inhabiting the S-SJ watershed face a profoundly altered habitat. The hydrological regimen of the S-SJ watershed has been severely disrupted since the late 1800s, when hydraulic mining operations were pervasive throughout the central Sierra Nevada region ( Cloern and Jassby, 2012 ). These changes have led to fish extinctions, extirpations ( Moyle, 2002 ) and population declines ( Stevens  et al. , 1985 ;  Kimmerer  et al. , 2001 ;  Moyle, 2002 ;  Sommer  et al. , 2011 ). Despite the imminent threats to native species, conservation actions in the S-SJ watershed are challenging due to heavy societal water demands and use of the watershed as a resource. The S-SJ watershed supplies water to 25â€…million people and 1â€…million hectares of farmland ( Service, 2007 ), facilitated by the construction of over 3300 water-diversion structures ( Herren and Kawasaki, 2001 ), which divert more than 40% of the watershed drainage from the river system ( Cloern and Jassby, 2012 ). Although many of these structures are not monitored for fish entrainment (i.e. being drawn in), anadromous fishes must pass by these diversion structures as they migrate, and the larval and juvenile fish of several species may be most susceptible to entrainment into diversions ( Danley  et al. , 2002 ;  Grimaldo  et al. , 2009 ). The spawning and rearing habitats of green and white sturgeon are located in the S-SJ watershed, and both species are susceptible to entrainment by the water diversion pumps operating in this watershed ( Adams  et al. , 2007 ;  Israel  et al. , 2009a ;  Mussen  et al. , 2014 ). Indeed, Californian water diversions have been implicated in the population declines of species such as Chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ;  Moyle, 2002 ), delta smelt ( Hypomesus transpacificus ;  Bennett, 2005 ), striped bass ( Morone saxatilis ;  Stevens  et al. , 1985 ) and green sturgeon ( Mussen  et al. , 2014 ). Additionally, entrainments of both green and white sturgeon are reported at state and federal pumping facilities ( NOAA, 2005 ;  Israel and Klimley, 2008 ;  Israel  et al. , 2009a ), with up to 10â€…000 white sturgeon reported in some years ( Israel  et al. , 2009a ).  For many fish species, relative year-class strength is most highly influenced by embryonic to larval stages ( Bradford, 1992 ). Recruitment failure during these early life stages has been identified as a major bottleneck to other North American acipenserid species ( Hardy and Litvak, 2004 ), and specifically to white sturgeon ( Duke  et al. , 1999 ;  Hildebrand  et al. , 1999 ). Larvae and juvenile green sturgeon appear to disperse downstream rapidly following emergence, after which they spend 0.5â€“4â€…years foraging throughout the watershed ( Adams  et al. , 2007 ). Between âˆ¼0.5 and 1.5â€…years of age, seawater tolerance ( Allen and Cech, 2007 , 2009, 2011) and a preference for high-salinity water ( Poletto  et al. , 2013 ) develops, suggesting a predisposition to migrate to marine waters at this age. Laboratory studies of white sturgeon suggest that salinities of 20â€…ppt are stressful to juveniles ( McEnroe and Cech, 1985 ;  Tashjian  et al. , 2007 ). On the Columbia River, juvenile white sturgeon migrate seasonally up- and downstream, but have not been observed further downstream than the associated estuary ( Parsley  et al. , 2008 ). Their intolerance of high salinities and migratory behaviour suggest that white sturgeon spend their entire juvenile life in their natal rivers. Therefore, anthropogenic alterations to their natal river systems, particularly for the dispersal and foraging stages of both larval and juvenile green and white sturgeon, are likely to have severe consequences at the population level. Little is known about the susceptibility of these two species to encounters with water-diversion structures during their larval life stage, and almost nothing is known of their ability to resist the altered water flows around diversions if they do encounter these facilities, though juvenile green sturgeon [30â€…cm and 150â€“200 days post-hatch (dph)] appear to be more vulnerable to impingement on diversion screens than white sturgeon of a similar size and age in sweeping flows of 20 and 37â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1  ( Poletto  et al.  2014 ).  Given that the ability of fishes to navigate or avoid water-diversion structures is related to their swimming capacity ( Hoover  et al. , 2005 ;  Swanson  et al. , 2005 ;  Adams  et al. , 2007 ;  Boysen and Hoover, 2009 ), one method to assess the susceptibility of fishes to altered water flows, such as those at or near water diversions, is to quantify critical swimming velocities (i.e. an index of prolonged swimming capacity,  U  crit ;  Brett, 1964 ;  Beamish, 1978 ). To date, the prolonged swimming capacities of larval green and white sturgeon have never been assessed. However, studies suggest that both species forage most actively from âˆ¼30â€…dph onwards and spend the majority of their time up to 30â€…dph inactively hiding within rocky substrate ( Kynard and Parker, 2005 ;  Kynard  et al. , 2005 ). The increased movement during this active foraging stage is most probably accompanied by increases in both swimming capacity and the potential to encounter water-diversion structures. Therefore, assessments of swimming abilities of these species during life stages that encounter water diversions are important to the management of these devices to minimize their impacts on sturgeon populations. In light of the paucity of information regarding swimming capacities of larval white and green sturgeon and their susceptibility to entrainment into water-diversion structures, the aim of the present study was to describe and compare the ontogeny of green and white sturgeon prolonged swimming capacities until completion of metamorphosis into juveniles, as well as to describe the allometry of swimming capacity throughout the juvenile life phase using swimming data in the published literature. We hypothesized that the similar lifestyles during the larval stage of these two species would be reflected in comparable swimming capacities throughout the larval life stage, but that the larger egg size of green sturgeon ( Deng  et al. , 2002 ) would result in larger larvae and faster growth throughout the larval stage. Furthermore, the allometry of green and white sturgeon swimming performance was compared with those of other sturgeon species to investigate inter-species differences in the ontogeny of swimming capacity. Finally, understanding the ontogeny of swimming capacity in green and white sturgeon of early dispersal and migration age can be used to inform conservation managers of appropriate protective water-diversion flow limitations specific to the S-SJ watershed and according to season and location.  Green and white sturgeon were reared in the laboratory at the Center for Aquatic Biology and Aquaculture, University of California, Davis (UC Davis). White sturgeon, obtained from Sterling Caviar and spawned in April 2012 and May 2013, were offspring of the F3 descendants of wild-caught Sacramento River sturgeon. Green sturgeon were tank spawned from first-generation domestic Klamath River broodstock in November 2011 and April 2013 following the methodology outlined by  Van Eenennaam  et al.  (2001 , 2012). For both species, the broodstock were spawned at 15Â°C, and eggs were reared at this temperature until 1â€…dph, when they were acclimated to 18â€…Â±â€…0.5Â°C well water. At the onset of exogenous feeding (âˆ¼10â€“12â€…dph), green and white sturgeon larvae were fed  ad libitum  with Rangen (Buhl, ID, USA) salmonid starter moist feed. For each spawn, larvae were split into two 1-m-diameter flow-through tanks supplied with 18â€…Â±â€…0.5Â°C, aerated well water (dissolved oxygen &gt;8.2â€…mgâ€…l âˆ’1 ) creating flows of &lt;5â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1  and reared under a natural photoperiod ( Van Eenennaam  et al. , 2001 , 2012). Fish handling, rearing and swimming tests were performed in agreement with the UC Davis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol no. 17017.  Protocols assessing  U  crit  were carried out at 18.5â€…Â±â€…0.5Â°C. Due to their small size and frequent feeding requirements ( Mohseni  et al. , 2006 ), larval fish were fasted for 3â€“4â€…h before an individual fish was randomly chosen from alternating tanks and introduced into the swimming flume for a 30â€…min acclimation period. Swimming flumes were either a 1.5 l cylindrical flume or a 5 l rectangular, flat-bottomed flume (Loligo Â®  Systems, Tjele, Denmark) equipped with a motor and a variable frequency driver. During the acclimation period, water velocity was 1â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1 . After 30â€…min, water velocity was increased to 10â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1  and then increased in increments of 5â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1  every 5 or 10â€…min, depending on the spawn year. During each increment, fish were monitored for swimming behaviour. If fish became impinged, which was defined as contact between the downstream screen of the chamber and a third of their body for any duration or less than a third of their body for 30â€…s, timers and flow were stopped for 2â€…min. After the 2â€…min rest, timers were restarted, and flow was resumed at the velocity at the time of impingement. On the third impingement at the same velocity increment, or failure to recommence swimming after the 2â€…min break, the fish was considered fatigued ( Allen  et al. , 2006a ). If a fish failed to successfully swim continuously through the first swimming velocity step by either holding station (avoiding swimming in the current) or impingement, that fish was considered to have low behavioural motivation to swim. These fish were not included in  U  crit  calculations, but are reported in the results as non-participants.  Preliminary tests with sturgeon larvae of different sizes and ages dictated that the time interval and swimming flume size and design be modified to achieve successful swimming throughout larval development. The 2013 spawn (green and white sturgeon measured at ages 20â€“42â€…dph) were swum in the 1.5â€…l cylindrical swimming flume for 5â€…min intervals. The 2011 green sturgeon and 2012 white sturgeon spawns (measured at ages 34â€“60â€…dph) were swum in the 5â€…l rectangular, flat-bottomed flume ( Hoover  et al. , 2011 ) for 10â€…min intervals. Comparisons of  U  crit  for 30â€“40â€…dph 2013 spawns (swum in the 1.5â€…l tunnel at 5â€…min intervals) with the same-aged 2011 or 2012 spawns (swum in the 5â€…l tunnel at 10â€…min intervals) using a one-way ANOVA did not differ in either species ( F  1,22 â€…=â€…1.053,  P â€…=â€…0.316 for green sturgeon; and  F  1,34 â€…=â€…0.541,  P â€…=â€…0.467 for white sturgeon).  Following completion of swimming tests, all fish were euthanized by buffered anaesthetic overdose (MS-222, 1â€…gâ€…l âˆ’1 ) and the wet mass (in grams), girth (circumference at the opercula, in centimetres) and TL measured.  Wet mass, TL and  U  crit  of larval green and white sturgeon, 20â€“60â€…dph, were evaluated for species differences by comparing the linear regression of TL, mass and absolute  U  crit  (in centimetres per second) with days post-hatch and  U  crit  (in centimetres per second) with TL.

Larval green and white sturgeon appeared to possess similar motivation to swim in the swim tunnel. Success rates for achieving continuous swimming in the swim tunnel for at least one interval were 87 and 86%, respectively, for green sturgeon (2011 spawned) and white sturgeon (2012 spawned), and 79 and 78%, respectively, for green and white sturgeon spawned in 2013.

This first assessement of the swimming capacities of larval green and white sturgeon revealed biological differences between the two species, which alone are not expected to dictate remarkably different conservation strategies around water-diversion structures. Furthermore, we report the first attempt at determining the allometric relationship between swimming capacity and size in sturgeons, in which we found potential inter-species differences.  Although there are no published swimming capacity values for larval green and white sturgeon with which to compare  U  crit  results, the sizes of green sturgeon reported here generally fell within the mass and length ranges reported in previous studies performed at similar temperatures. Green sturgeon at the end of the larval stage (60â€…dph) were of similar masses (range, 1.5â€“2.7â€…g) and lengths (range, 6â€“7.5â€…cm) to previously reported late-larval green sturgeon masses (range, 1.5â€“3â€…g) and lengths (range, 6.2â€“9.4â€…cm;  Deng  et al. , 2002 ;  Allen  et al. , 2006b ). White sturgeon, in contrast, tended to be slightly larger than previously reported. Although the early larval (20â€…dph) white sturgeon weight range of 0.2â€“0.4â€…g overlapped with white sturgeon of a similar age (20â€“30â€…dph) of 0.09â€“0.23â€…g ( Deng  et al. , 2003 ,  2009 ), late larval white sturgeon were slightly larger than previously reported. White sturgeon metamorphosing into juveniles (45â€…dph) in a previous study averaged 4.5â€…cm in length and had a mean weight of 1â€…g ( Deng  et al. , 2002 ), compared with the length and weight ranges of 7â€“9â€…cm and 2.5â€“3.2â€…g, respectively, for white sturgeon of a similar age in the present study. The larger size of late larval stage white sturgeon in this study is consistent with previously reported inter-family and inter-individual variability for green and white sturgeon ( Van Eenennaam  et al. , 2005 ;  Linares-Casenave  et al. , 2013 ) which may explain the ontological differences between the two species observed here. Replication of larval ontogeny studies is needed to strengthen support for these differences.  All larval growth studies discussed here, including this one, were performed at water temperatures ranging from 18 to 19Â°C. The effects of temperature on the growth of larval green and white sturgeon between 20 and 60â€…dph have never been assessed, but the growth of older, larger green sturgeon (&gt;144â€…dph) increases with increasing temperature up to 15Â°C ( Mayfield and Cech, 2004 ). We expect that similar effects of temperature on growth would occur in larval sturgeons. Therefore, given that size influences  U  crit  (Figs  2  and  3 ), temperature would most probably affect  U  crit  of larval sturgeons. This effect would probably also be influenced by the direct effects of temperature on swimming performance, which result in increased swimming speeds at higher temperatures, up to a high-temperature limit ( Mayfield and Cech, 2004 ;  Allen  et al. , 2006a ;  Deslauriers and Kieffer, 2012b ).  Absolute swimming capacity (i.e. expressed in centimetres per second) generally increases with increasing body size in fishes ( Bainbridge, 1960 ;  Brett, 1965 ;  He, 1986 ), and absolute  U  crit  measured in both larval green and larval white sturgeon increased with size, as expected (Figs  2 B and 3B). Also as expected, absolute  U  crit  values of larval green and larval white sturgeon increased at similar rates with growth through the larval life stage. However,  U  crit  values of larval green sturgeon aged 20â€“60â€…dph were consistently âˆ¼10â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1  greater than those for white sturgeon of the same age (Fig.  2 A).  Unlike absolute swimming capacity, relative swimming capacity (i.e. expressed as body lengths per second) tends to decrease with size according to a power relationship in fishes ( Bainbridge, 1960 ;  Brett, 1965 ;  He, 1986 ). The exponent of the power function relating maximal sprint swimming speed with body length has been determined as âˆ’1.09, âˆ’0.58 and âˆ’0.71 for sprinting common dace ( Leuciscus leuciscus ), rainbow trout ( Oncorynchus mykiss ) and goldfish ( Carassius auratus ), respectively ( Bainbridge, 1960 ). For prolonged swimming capacity, the allometric exponent appears to range from âˆ’0.43 to âˆ’0.53, based on measurements on sockeye salmon ( Oncorynchus nerka ; calculated from  Brett, 1965 ) and saithe ( Pollachius virens ;  He, 1986 ). To our knowledge, the relationship between swimming capacity and body size has not been examined for any sturgeon species. Considering the unique body and tail morphology of these basal actinopterygians, which theoretically results in inefficient swimming kinetics ( Webb, 1986 ;  Qu  et al. , 2013 ), we hypothesized that sturgeon species would possess a unique allometric exponent.  The body and tail shape of sturgeons differs from that of the typical, faster swimming actinopterygians and more closely resembles that of chondrichthyans. Differing from the more derived actinopterygian homocercal caudal fin, the sturgeon caudal fin is heterocercal, which, for lake sturgeon, has been shown to generate 66% less thrust than for the homocercal caudal fin of trout ( Webb, 1986 ). Further reductions in acipenserid swimming efficiency arise from increased drag due to the sturgeon spindle-shaped body form and rough body surface ( Webb, 1986 ), in comparison to the smooth surfaces and streamlined fusiform body shape of more derived fishes. This inefficiency in body design results in reduced burst, prolonged and sustained swimming capacities compared with those of salmonids ( Peake  et al. , 1997 ; Deslauliers and Kieffer, 2012a) .  In combination with the behavioural tendency of sturgeons to station hold at high water velocities ( Webb, 1986 ; Parsons  et al.,  2003; Hoover  et al.,  2005; Deslauliers and Kieffer, 2012a), these aspects of sturgeon morphology have the potential to alter the allometric exponent for the lengthâ€“swimming capacity relationship for sturgeons compared with other actinopterygians.  Indeed, the allometric exponent for green, but not white sturgeon, as determined by relating  U  crit  and length of larval sturgeons from this study and juvenile sturgeons from previous studies, differed from that of other actinopterygians. The allometric exponent for all known  U  crit  (in body lengths per second) data for larval to 80-cm-long green and white sturgeon shows the allometric relationship between  U  crit  (in body lengths per second) and length of white sturgeon to have an exponent of âˆ’0.42, which is more like that of sockeye salmon (calculated from  Brett, 1965 ) and saithe ( He, 1986 ), compared with the exponent of âˆ’0.83 for green sturgeon, which more closely resembles the exponent for sprint swimming in common dace and goldfish ( Bainbridge, 1960 ). Although these dissimilarities could be an artifact of the lack of  U  crit  values for 40- to 80-cm-long white sturgeon, they may also reflect differences in the ontogeny of green and white sturgeon prolonged swimming capacities.  Sometime between the completion of metamorphosis into juveniles (âˆ¼60â€…dph and at a TL of 7â€“8 and 9â€“11â€…cm for green and white sturgeon, respectively) and the onset of green sturgeon tolerance of full-strength sea water (âˆ¼130â€…dph and at a TL of âˆ¼25â€…cm;  Allen and Cech, 2007 ;  Allen  et al. , 2009 ,  2011 ), white sturgeon  U  crit  (in centimetres per second) began to exceed that of green sturgeon. This transition appears to be due to a shallower slope of increase in  U  crit  with length of green compared with white sturgeon during the early juvenile stage. The timing of this transition is consistent with previously reported evidence of a seasonal reduction in swimming capacity of green sturgeon undergoing physiological changes associated with preparation for downstream migration to estuarine or marine waters ( Allen  et al. , 2006a ). More swimming data on white sturgeon of the 40â€“80â€…cm size range are required to determine whether this difference between green and white sturgeon  U  crit  is maintained throughout the life of these two species.  Although the paucity of published  U  crit  values for other sturgeon species across a significant size range prevents comparison of green and white sturgeon allometric exponents with those of other  Acipenser  species, early juvenile green and white sturgeon appear to have superior swimming capacities compared with other  Acipenser  species at this life stage. The  U  crit  (in centimetres per second) of Chinese sturgeon ( Acipenser sinensis ), pallid sturgeon ( Scaphirhynchus albus ), shovelnose sturgeon ( Scaphirhynchus platorynchus ), Amur sturgeon ( Acipenser schrenckii ) and shortnose sturgeon ( Acipenser brevirostrum ) with lengths of âˆ¼20â€…cm or less lie below the green and white sturgeon allometric curves (Table  1  and Fig.  3 A and B). Sturgeons &gt;30â€…cm long appear to lie on the green sturgeon allometric curve. Thus, despite their potentially higher prolonged swimming capacity during the larval and early juvenile stage, green and white sturgeon have similar swimming capacities to other  Acipenser  species during later juvenile and adult life stages. It should be noted, however, that comparisons of  U  crit  values among studies have inherent challenges, because test temperatures ( Mayfield and Cech, 2004 ;  Allen  et al. , 2006a ) and end-point criteria for exhaustion, as well as the chosen time intervals and speed increments of the tests ( Beamish, 1978 ;  Hammer, 1995 ), are not standardized and can have substantial effects on  U  crit  measurements. It is possible that methodological differences may affect exhaustion end-points, thereby influencing  U  crit  values across  Acipenser  studies.  The stronger swimming capacities of larval and early juvenile green and white sturgeon may reflect demands for relatively vigorous swimming activity during early life stages of these species. Laboratory-based studies suggest that early juvenile white sturgeon from the Sacramento River undergo an active dispersal, with strong swimming behaviour ( Kynard and Parker, 2005 ). Late larval green sturgeon have also been shown to swim actively up- and downstream while foraging in laboratory-based studies, and early juveniles actively migrate downstream to over-wintering grounds ( Kynard  et al. , 2005 ). Chinese sturgeon, in contrast, discontinue laboratory-observed migratory behaviour early in their life history, before the larval life stage begins ( Zhuang  et al. , 2002 ), and pallid and shovelnose sturgeon both exhibit passive drifting migratory behaviour in the laboratory (Kynard  et al.,  2002), which suggests that their foraging phase may not require a high swimming capacity. Shortnose sturgeon are amphidromous ( Bemis and Kynard, 1997 ); this primarily freshwater lifestyle may not require the swimming capacity of the anadromous green and semi-anadromous white sturgeon. Contrary to this interpretation of anadromous sturgeons having greater swimming capacity than non-anadromous sturgeons during the early juvenile phase, Amur sturgeon, which are anadromous ( Bemis and Kynard, 1997 ), possess a lower swimming capacity than green sturgeon at the early juvenile life stage. In the laboratory, this species exhibits migratory behaviour lasting much of their larval stage ( Zhuang  et al. , 2003 ). Perhaps Amur sturgeon also experience a drop in swimming ability related to physiological preparation for entry into saline waters that is seen in green sturgeon with the onset of migration to brackish and salt water ( Allen  et al. , 2006a ). Thus, it seems that the strong swimming ability of larval and early juvenile green and white sturgeon could be reflective of their life-history strategies.  Based on the results of this study and previously published laboratory behavioural and field observational studies, we have developed seasonal recommendations of water flow velocities likely to overwhelm larval green and white sturgeon at water-diversion facilities. We caution that these recommendations are based solely on capacity to maintain position in water flows, and encourage them to be considered in conjunction with species- and life-stage-specific behavioural responses to water flows and water-diversion structures. Unfortunately, sturgeon water-diversion-structure behavioural interaction studies are limited; however, juvenile green sturgeon appear to lack avoidance behaviour when encountering water-diversion structures ( Mussen  et al. , 2014 ).  The threatened Southern Distinct Population Segment of green sturgeon spawn primarily in the upper reaches of the Sacramento River from April to May ( Adams  et al. , 2007 ;  Heublein  et al. , 2008 ) .  Based on laboratory studies, it appears that hatched green sturgeon, unlike other acipenserids, which are typically transiently pelagic immediately after hatch, exclusively hide in rocks at the river bottom until initiation of exogenous feeding at 10â€…dph. At this stage, they begin a 10â€…day nocturnally active dispersal downstream to foraging sites in the middle reaches of the river (Kynard  et al.,  2005). Once dispersed to foraging sites, larval green sturgeon appear to forage nocturnally on the river bottom and hide in the rocks during the day until âˆ¼100â€…dph or the autumn, when they begin another active downstream migration (Kynard  et al.,  2005). At this age, green sturgeon have demonstrated tolerance of and preference for near full-strength seawater ( Allen and Cech, 2007 ;  Allen  et al. , 2009 ,  2011 ; Poletto  et al.,  2013) and are therefore likely to migrate to the S-SJ Delta or San Pablo and San Francisco bays. The physiological preparation process for this migration from fresh to saltwater has been associated with reductions in  U  crit  of juvenile (0.5- to 1.5-year-old) green sturgeon (Allen  et al.,  2006a).  During their initial dispersal migration in spring, the tiny 10â€…dph larval green sturgeon are probably vulnerable to being overwhelmed by water-diversion intake flows. At 20â€“25â€…dph (âˆ¼2â€…cm TL), green sturgeon  U  crit  ranged from 20 to 53â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1 , and the linear regression predicted a mean  U  crit  of 29â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1 . Swimming capacity consistently increased with days post-hatch (Fig.  2 ), which suggests that younger, migrating green sturgeon are unlikely to have swimming capacities this high. Therefore, nighttime flows at water-diversion structures likely to be encountered by green sturgeon in the upper and middle reaches of the Sacramento River from May through the summer should be limited to 29â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1 , assuming that they detect the diversion flows and can avoid them behaviourally.  Mussen  et al.  (2014)  showed that larger juvenile green sturgeon are easily entrained in a simulated water-diversion intake structure.  By 55â€…dph, when green sturgeon were âˆ¼7â€…cm long and expected to remain nocturnally foraging in the middle reaches of the river, mean  U  crit  predicted from the linear regression increased 1.9-fold to 54â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1  (Fig.  2 ) and ranged from 46 to 58â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1 . This suggests that diversion structures in the middle reaches of the Sacramento River should be limited to maximal velocities of 54â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1  during the night from July until the following May spawn, assuming that they detect the diversion flows and can avoid them behaviourally.  The  U  crit  of juvenile green sturgeon changes slowly with growth, such that with a 6-fold increase in total length from 8 to 50â€…cm, mean  U  crit  increased only 1.2-fold, from 50 to 60â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1  (Fig.  3 B). In addition to this modest increase,  U  crit  values of 50-cm-long sturgeon are highly variable, ranging from 20 to 75â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1 , with nearly a quarter of the sturgeon at this size swimming &lt;â€…40â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1 . As this size corresponds to the range exhibiting reductions in swimming capacity thought to be related to downstream migration to saltwater ( Allen  et al. , 2006a ), a corresponding reduction in maximal diversion velocities to 40â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1  may be important to protect migrating juvenile green sturgeon through the middle and lower reaches of the Sacramento River and the Delta and Bays in October and November ( Mussen  et al. , 2014 ).  Swimming capacity of green sturgeon larger than 70â€…cm has not been assessed. Therefore, lower Sacramento River and Delta diversion structures from which juvenile green sturgeon are expected to encounter flows should be limited to maximal flows of 54â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1 , assuming that they detect the diversion flows and can avoid them behaviourally.  Most Sacramento River white sturgeon spawning appears to be limited to between Colusa (river kmâ€…231) and Verona, California (river kmâ€…160;  Kolhorst, 1976 ). Laboratory studies suggest that immediately upon hatching, white sturgeon hatchlings disperse passively downstream for 10â€…days ( Kynard and Parker, 2005 ). From 10 to 28â€…dph, white sturgeon forage with gradually increasing activity and progress from hiding within rocky substrate to complete use of open bottom, additionally spending some time at the surface or within the water column ( Kynard and Parker, 2005 ). Active foraging appears to continue until 50â€…dph, when white sturgeon behaviour in the laboratory suggests a second downstream migration ( Kynard and Parker, 2005 ). Larvae have been found as far downstream as Suisun Bay, but such far-downstream larval sightings occur in high-flow years when larvae have probably been overwhelmed by flows and flushed downstream ( Stevens and Miller, 1970 ).  Hatchling white sturgeon are likely to be highly susceptible to entrainment into water-diversion structures during the passive dispersal phase, because these fish have virtually no ability to resist diversion flows during this life stage. Middle to lower Sacramento River diversion structures in the vicinity of white sturgeon spawning sites should be highly regulated when adults are spawning (Februaryâ€“May).  Due to their high foraging activity, 30â€…dph larval white sturgeon, which are located throughout the lower reaches of the Sacramento River from March to June, are likely to be vulnerable to entrainment into water-diversion structures. At 35â€…dph (âˆ¼5.5â€…cm TL), white sturgeon  U  crit  values ranged from 22 to 45â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1 , and the linear regression equation predicted a  U  crit  of 29â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1  (Fig.  2 ), suggesting that the majority of the population, if able to detect and avoid diversion flows, would not be vulnerable to water-diversion flow rates lower than 29â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1 . Later in the summer, as larval white sturgeon grow and metamorphose into juveniles (60â€…dph, âˆ¼10â€…cm TL), their swimming capacity, and therefore their ability to escape diversion structure flows, increased slightly to 41â€“48â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1 , with the linear regression predicting a  U  crit  of 45â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1  (Fig.  2 ). At this developmental stage, some sturgeon have also been found in the Bay ( Stevens and Miller, 1970 ) and, therefore, potentially the Delta as well. Therefore, lower Sacramento River and Delta diversion structures potentially encountered by foraging larval white sturgeon from March to June should be limited to maximal flows of 29â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1 . These limits can probably be increased further in the autumn to a maximum of 50â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1  as fish grow and increase swimming capacity (Figs  2  and  3 ) until the next spawn in the following February. Although  U  crit  values of 115â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1  were achieved by 95-cm-long (7â€…kg) white sturgeon (personal communication from Nguyen, Jackson, and Peterson), fish of this size are likely to be &gt;1â€…year old. Through the winter months, neither size nor swimming capacity is expected to increase, so it is unlikely that white sturgeon spending their first winter in the Sacramento River are able to hold position in water flows &gt;50â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1 .  Overview of flow-tolerance limitations of green and white sturgeon throughout the Sacramentoâ€“San Joaquin watershed according to location and time of year, based on critical swimming velocity data  Abbreviations: GS, green sturgeon; WS, white sturgeon. Green sections demarcate tolerable water velocities of â‰¥50â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1 ; red sections demarcate presence of life stages which are predicted to be intolerant of even very low water velocities; and yellow sections signify recommended water flow velocity limitations to protect present life stages. Behavioural (e.g. avoidance) considerations are not part of this analysis, and they remain an important topic for future research.  Throughout the entire Sacramento River system from December to February, sturgeons present are unlikely to be overwhelmed by flows below 50â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1 . This period can be extended to April for the upper reaches, where green sturgeon tend to spawn. From February to June, populations of highly susceptible larval sturgeons with limited to no swimming ability are present within the river system. This is of particular concern in the middle to lower reaches from February until April, when young white sturgeon are expected to be drifting passively downstream from spawning sites. In the upper reaches, susceptible larval green sturgeon with limited swimming capabilities are expected to be present in April and May. By the end of May, green sturgeon larvae in the upper reaches are expected to have developed sufficient swimming ability to resist flows up to 29â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1 , but white sturgeon in the middle to lower reaches are not expected to develop similar swimming capacities until June. By July, although green sturgeon present throughout the upper to lower reaches are likely to be able to resist water flows &gt;50â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1 , white sturgeon in the lower reaches remain limited to flows of 45â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1  until September. In October, as juvenile green sturgeon develop saltwater tolerance and begin their downstream migration to the estuaries and bays, their swimming capacity drops, requiring a 2â€…month (October and November) 40â€…cmâ€…s âˆ’1  limit of flows around water-diversion structures in the middle and lower Sacramento River and the Delta and bays.  Similar conservation recommendations can be applied to other acipenserid species, with adjustments for dispersal behaviour, river site usage and behavioural responses to flows and diversion structures. The slightly greater absolute  U  crit  (in centimetres per second) of early juvenile green and white sturgeon compared with other sturgeon species suggests that acipenserids in general require lower velocities than green and white sturgeon around diversion structures, if they are to resist entrainment volitionally. However, it is also important to consider the behavioural responses of the different sturgeons and their life stages to water-diversion structures. The complete lack of published larval  U  crit  data for any acipenserid species before this study underscores the urgency for studies on this vulnerable life stage of this globally imperiled family.
