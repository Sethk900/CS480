A Regional Landscape Approach to Maintain DiversityLand managers have traditionally assumed that achieving maximum local habitat diversity will favor diversity of wildlife. Recent trends in species composition in fragmented landscapes suggest, however, that a more comprehensive view is required for perpetuation of regional diversity. A regional network of preserves, with sensitive habitats insulated from human disturbance, might best perpetuate ecosystem integrity in the long term. (Accepted for publication 5 May 1983).
