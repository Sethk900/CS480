Effect of simulated acid rain and sulphur nutrition on the growth, sulphate and cation content of Bromus diandrus Roth.Bromus diandrus seedlings were grown in sand culture under greenhouse conditions, using a two factor randomized block design. Two levels of sulphur nutrition (with and without) and three acid rain treatments were applied. The plants were harvested 45 days after the start of the simulated acid rain treatments, and analysed for sulphate and cations. Sulphur deficiency significantly reduced the growth of the plants but simulated acid rain did not. Sulphur deficient plants had significantly more magnesium in the shoots and less in the roots, suggesting redistribution of the magnesium. Root potassium content was significantly higher in sulphur deficient plants, and lower in those plants receiving acid rain of pH 2,5. The results suggest that acid rain is not a stress factor where Bromus diandrus is concerned. S. Afr. J. Plant Soil 1985, 2: 98â€“100
