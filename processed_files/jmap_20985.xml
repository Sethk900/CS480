Rhabdorrhynchus echii (Brahm, 1790), a â€œforgottenâ€ name (Coleoptera, Curculionidae, Lixinae)Abstract The application of the name Curculio echii Brahm, 1790 is discussed. Based on the description it is evident that it should be applied to a German species of the genus Rhabdorrhynchus, and that it has priority over the name currently applied to the species, Rhabdorrhynchus seriegranosus Chevrolat, 1873. The new combination Rhab-dorrhynchus echii (Brahm, 1790) is proposed. As there is a lack of any type material of Curculio echii a neotype is designated. Based on the study of the type specimen, Rhabdorrhynchus seriegranosus is restored as a valid species.
