Soil respiration and carbon storage of an acrisol under forest and different cultivations in Rio de Janeiro State, BrazilSoil respiration rates of a clay-loam textured Acrisol under different uses (Atlantic forest, manioc, horticulture and pasture) from Rio de Janeiro State were measured. The relationship between carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and soil physico-chemical properties were investigated. Rates of CO2 emission of two sites (Atlantic forest and horticulture) were also evaluated in different seasons in 1997 and 1998. In the forest site, monthly means of measured respiration rates showed good correlation with soil temperature in the range 19.6-24.1degreeC (r2 = 0.89). In the horticulture site, no change was observed with soil moisture alone, in the range 3.0-13.2wt%. In the horticulture soil, even when the surface soil was very dry, respiration rates increased in the hot, wetter summer but remained higher than the mean flux from forest soil. The CO2 emission flux of the Acrisol under different use showed good correlation with soil temperature (r2 = 0.72) and moisture (r2 = 0.61).
