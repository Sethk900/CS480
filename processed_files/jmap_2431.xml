BIRDS TRANSPORT NUTRIENTS TO FRAGMENTED FORESTS IN AN URBAN LANDSCAPE.The influence of urbanization on nutrient cycling is vaguely known. Here we document that birds, especially those increasing in urban areas (such as crows, <em>Corvus macrorhynchos</em> and <em>C. corone</em>), affect nutrient cycles. Using fecal traps, we measured phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) input from the excrement of birds in fragmented forests in an urban landscape. Sources of avian feces were examined on the basis of carbon (C), N, and P percentages and stable isotopes of δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C. Nitrogen and P input was aggregated in the urban landscape, being especially high at the forest where crows roosted during winter. The annual P input due to bird droppings (range 0.068–0.460 kg·ha<sup>−1</sup>·yr<sup>−1</sup>; mean 0.167 kg·ha<sup>−1</sup>·yr<sup>−1</sup>) was 12.4% of the total of other pathways in typical forests and 52.9% in the evergreen forest where crows roosted. The annual N input due to bird droppings (range 0.44–3.49 kg·ha<sup>−1</sup>·yr<sup>−1</sup>; mean 1.15 kg·ha<sup>−1</sup>·yr<sup>−1</sup>) was 5.2% of the total of other pathways in typical forests and 27.0% in the evergreen forest used by roosting crows. Expected sources of nutrients in feces included insects in the breeding season, fruits in autumn, and mammals and birds in winter. Stable isotopes suggested that the source of nutrients in forests used by roosting crows was from outside the forest. Therefore, birds played a significant role as transporters of nutrients from garbage (including fish, livestock, and/or C<sub>4</sub> plants such as corn, with high δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C) in residential and business areas to fragmented evergreen forests, especially near their winter roosts.
