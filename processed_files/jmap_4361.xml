Component dry masses and carbohydrate contents in honeybush II: Cyclopia subternataA four-year reconnaissance-level survey was carried out in a honeybush (Cyclopia subternata; Cs) population to obtain information concerning this new South African horticultural crop. Average total dry mass (DM) in Cs cuttings under plantation conditions was 2 481 g plant−1, of which the harvestable top growth (shoots), non-harvestable top growth (stem) and roots constituted 17%, 59% and 24%, respectively. Starch reserves averaged 6 321 mg plant−1, (stem 62%, roots 38%). Corresponding values for Cs seedlings were 3 796 g plant−1 (13%, 62% and 25%) and 10 044 mg plant−1 (69% and 31%). Ratios of shoot DM to non-harvestable DM, and of stem to root starch content were, respectively, 1:4.799 and 1:0.620 in the cuttings, and 1:6.753 and 1:0.447 in the seedlings. Yields of dry shoots averaged 3.6 t ha−1 from the cuttings and 4.2 t ha−1 from the seedlings. Top growth DM and starch reserves were greatest in late summer to autumn. Autumn is therefore the best time to harvest.
