Synthesis of Thiosulfonate-Bridged Bromofluorene Endcapping ReagentsA simple and versatile synthesis of thiosulfonate-bridged bromofluorene end-capping reagents is reported. The novel fluorene-based Ï€-electron-poor aromatic building block was used as end-capping reagent in the synthesis of a polyfluorene-based molecular wire.
