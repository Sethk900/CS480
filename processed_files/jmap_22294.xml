Generic switch-over during ontogenesis in Dimorphacanthella gen. n. (Collembola, Isotomidae) with barcoding evidenceAbstract A new genus Dimorphacanthella is established for Tetracanthella anommatos Chen and Yin, 1984 and Dimorphacanthella mediaseta sp. n. from China. The new genus exhibits an unusual metamorphosis: small juveniles, previously called Uzelia anommatos Yue & Yin, 1999 get the second pair of anal spines resulted from moulting and become â€œTetracanthellaâ€. Species identity of forms with two and four anal spines is proved by barcoding analysis. The derivation of anal spines is compared among genera having four anal spines.
