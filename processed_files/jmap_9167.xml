Sonified Infrared Spectra and Their Interpretation by Blind and Visually Impaired StudentsTo make the analysis of infrared (IR) spectra accessible to students who are blind and visually impaired (BVI), the visual information of the spectra was converted into nonspeech sounds using the open-source programs JDXview v0.2 and CSV to MIDI converter. In the sonified infrared spectra (SIRS), time is used as a spectral frequency indicator, and the range of the selected musical instrument frequencies is correlated with the intensity of the corresponding band absorptions. To simplify the identification of the absorption bands in the SIRS, seven audible distinguishable time markers were added: at the beginning, 3000, 2500, 2000, 1500, 1000 cm–1, and at the end. This approach allows the fast identification of typical functional groups, or a set of frequencies related to a particular structural pattern in a molecule. By conveying IR spectral data, SIRS will aid BVI students’ chemical education; SIRS can be used either for distance learning or in classroom activities.
