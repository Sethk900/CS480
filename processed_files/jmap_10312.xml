Pasture yield response to precipitation and high temperature in MongoliaAnimal-available pasture biomass has been observed and recorded for the past few decades to assess the crucial impact of pasture conditions on pastoral livestock husbandry, which is one of the major industries in Mongolia. This database provided a unique, useful basis for the present correlation analysis between seasonal measures of meteorological variables and pasture yield at three sites in southern Mongolia. Precipitation in July exhibited a high correlation with pasture yield, whereas high temperatures in June and July demonstrated a considerable negative correlation. Consequently, a reduction in precipitation with an increase in high temperature results in a lower yield, whereas sufficient precipitation with a reduction in high temperature results in greater production. The study also attempted to establish a new aridity index. The pasture yield correlated closely with the new aridity index. This implies that aridity has the potential to restrain grass growth in Mongolia.
