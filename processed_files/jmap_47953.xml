Redescription of Stenolophus thoracicus Casey (Coleoptera, Carabidae, Harpalini), a valid speciesAbstract Stenolophus thoracicus Casey is revalidated. The species is redescribed based on a study of the syntypes and of several conspecific specimens from eastern North America. The species differs from the other eastern species of the subgenus Agonoleptus in having the metasternum shorter and the wings reduced to tiny stubs. The dorsal habitus and median lobe of the aedeagus, along with the structures of the internal sac, are illustrated.
