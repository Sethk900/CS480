Comparisons in nesting biology of two sympatric carpenter bee species (Apidae: Xylocopini)This work analyses the biology and nesting behaviour of Xylocopa ordinaria and Xylocopa frontalis, providing information for their conservation and management. The study was performed from August 2006 to December 2007 and considered 25 nests of X. ordinaria and 23 of X. frontalis. The X. frontalis nested between December and April, while X. ordinaria nested throughout the year. Nests of X. ordinaria dug in wider substrates had more tunnels, and the width of nest tunnels and the dimensions of brood cells were smaller than were observed for X. frontalis. Females spent most of their time in activities inside their nests, followed by nectar and pollen flights and nectar dehydration. Pollen resources used by these bees presented more than 40% similarity, and they were constant to flower resources while provisioning cells. Cissites maculata and a Diptera species were the natural enemies found.
