Life history patterns of terrestrial isopods from mesic habitats in the temperate region of Northern Israel (Isopoda: Porcellionidae, Armadillidae)The life history patterns of two isopod species from mesic habitats in a temperate region were studied. The isopods: Porcellio chuldaensia (Porcellionidae) and Armadillo sp. ('Brown') (Armadillidae) inhabit heavy soils in northern Israel. Both species breed during spring and early summer, but differ in the number of oocytes, eggs and mancas they produce, and thus in their reproductive allocation. Judging from the structure of their ovaries, they are capable of breeding for a few years. In the laboratory they bred once yearly for two years.
