Review of the Oriental Monotypic Genus Pibrocha Kirkaldy (Hemiptera, Fulgoromorpha, Fulgoridae, Dorysarthrinae)Abstract The monotypic genus Pibrocha Kirkaldy, 1902, known only from Sri Lanka in the Oriental region, is closely related to Dorysarthrus Puton, 1895 from southwestern Asia and northern Africa (Palaearctic region). The genusis revised to include a first description of the male genital structures and a discussion of relationships between Pibrocha, Dorysarthrus and Dichoptera Spinola, 1839. A diagnostic key to the three genera and photos of their type species are provided for better comparison in these taxa. Pibrocha is assigned tentatively from Dictyopharidae to the subfamily Dorysarthrinae (Fulgoridae).
