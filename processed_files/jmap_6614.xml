The inheritance of base temperature in grain sorghumTwo different methods were used to identify the genetic determinants of the base temperatures of sorghum seeds which were germinated at 15Â°C. These were a factorial mating design and a crossing system to identify lines which contain the greatest number of loci with favourable alleles. The results indicated a dominant cytoplasmic effect on the base temperature which was also affected by incompletely dominant nuclear genes. The implications of the results for sorghum breeding are discussed.
