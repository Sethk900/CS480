Remote identification and mapping of canopy tree species can contribute valuable information towards our understanding of ecosystem biodiversity and function over large spatial scales. However, the extreme challenges posed by highly diverse, closed-canopy tropical forests have prevented automated remote species mapping of non-flowering tree crowns in these ecosystems. We set out to identify individuals of three focal canopy tree species amongst a diverse background of tree and liana species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, using airborne imaging spectroscopy data. First, we compared two leading single-class classification methodsâ€”binary support vector machine (SVM) and biased SVMâ€”for their performance in identifying pixels of a single focal species. From this comparison we determined that biased SVM was more precise and created a multi-species classification model by combining the three biased SVM models. This model was applied to the imagery to identify pixels belonging to the three focal species and the prediction results were then processed to create a map of focal species crown objects. Crown-level cross-validation of the training data indicated that the multi-species classification model had pixel-level producerâ€™s accuracies of 94â€“97% for the three focal species, and field validation of the predicted crown objects indicated that these had userâ€™s accuracies of 94â€“100%. Our results demonstrate the ability of high spatial and spectral resolution remote sensing to accurately detect non-flowering crowns of focal species within a diverse tropical forest. We attribute the success of our model to recent classification and mapping techniques adapted to species detection in diverse closed-canopy forests, which can pave the way for remote species mapping in a wider variety of ecosystems.  Taking a single-species detection approach, we set out to map three important canopy tree species within the diverse, closed-canopy tropical forest of Barro Colorado Island, Panama, using high spatial resolution imaging spectrometer data. We evaluated two leading single-class classification methods (discussed in detail in Methods section) for their ability to distinguish the remotely-sensed spectra of the focal species from a diverse background of other tree and liana species based solely on their non-flowering crown spectral characteristics. We combined the selected single-species models into a multi-species model for mapping the three focal species across the island and evaluated the predictions by confirming the species identities in the field. Our species maps were highly reliable, demonstrating that tropical tree species can be effectively mapped with airborne imaging spectroscopy data. Together, the techniques presented here represent a high-performance, operational method for the identification of individual tree crown objects of one or more focal species that is adapted to the challenges encountered in tropical forests and greatly reduces the burden of training data collection.  A field campaign was conducted to locate and identify individual tree crowns within the CAO image in January of 2013. Crown locations were recorded in the field with a handheld Global Positioning System (GS50 Leica Geosystems Inc., Norcross, GA, USA). These crowns were then manually delineated in the CAO imagery, taking care to ensure that the pixels extracted were as pure as possible, without contamination from lianas or neighboring trees. The crowns were collected along trails traversing the full east-west span of the island, sampling across all flight lines. The campaign was conducted to sample the tree diversity of the island as widely as possible, without sampling large numbers of any one species. This resulted in 340 crowns representing 84 tree species. Although not used in this study, leaves were collected from identified crowns with a permit from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institution to Robin Martin.  Once the optimal parameters were identified, we compared the performance of the binary and biased SVM models. For binary SVM, one-fifth of both the focal and outlier crowns were removed to form the test dataset and a model was built using the remaining data using the optimal parameter values. For biased SVM, one-fifth of the focal species crowns were removed and placed in the test dataset and a model was built using the remaining focal species crowns and 32,000 pseudo-outlier pixels. Focal and outlier crowns were randomly assigned to the training and test groups and the same group assignments were used for both the binary and biased models of the same species. This procedure was repeated 100 times. We were especially interested in comparing the sensitivity and specificity (the proportion of outlier class samples that are correctly assigned to the outlier class) of the two classifiers. Therefore, although the outlier crowns were not used to train the biased SVMs, the test outlier crowns were passed to the biased SVM models to estimate specificity. We also compared the performance of binary and biased SVM by using each to map the focal species across the island. For each focal species and classifier type, a classification model was built from the full dataset and this was applied to all vegetation pixels in the CAO imagery.  The raster of the model prediction results contained some amount of undesirable noise (spatially random pixels assigned to the focal classes). To reduce this noise, we applied contextual filters to the model prediction results. First, we resized the raster grid by cutting each pixel into quarters and performed opening-closing on the raster of predicted occurrences for each species (3 Ã— 3 pixel kernel; ENVI software, Exelis, Boulder, CO USA). The opening procedure removed small objects of two pixels in width and then the closing procedure filled small holes of two pixels in width (here, two pixels in width is equivalent to one pixel in width at the original resolution). The raster grid was then resized to the original resolution and each contiguous area belonging to the same focal class was designated as an individual object (contiguity was defined as pixels that were side-adjacent). Objects with fewer than ten pixels were eliminated and objects that remained were counted as crown objects. We refer to these areas as â€œcrown objectsâ€ rather than â€œcrownsâ€ to acknowledge that a single crown object may contain the crowns of two or more individual conspecific trees, and that the crown of one individual tree may be represented by two or more smaller crown objects, separated perhaps by liana or shadow.  To obtain estimates of model precision for predicted crown objects, we returned to the island to verify their species identity. The prediction map was brought to the field on a tablet PC and predicted crown objects located near trails (&lt; 20 m away) were checked to verify their species identity. Only trail segments that were not visited in the first field campaign were used for model verification. No permits were needed to check the identities of the tree crowns on the island.  Additional field observations were recorded to help with the interpretation of the prediction map. We noted the presence of individuals of the focal species with crowns reaching the top of the canopy (at least 5 m in diameter) that were encountered in the field but not indicated by the prediction map, which might be considered as a failure of the model to detect the presence of that species. For all focal species trees encountered, the presence and severity of liana infestation of the tree crown was recorded, with special attention to whether the lianas were covering the top of the canopy. However, the field search for omitted focal species crowns was not systematic and there was ambiguity in which ones should be considered to be a genuine omission error (for example, the presence of lianas may indicate that the omission is correct from a remote sensing perspective). Therefore, we could not quantify the proportion of focal species canopy individuals that were not detected (i.e., we could not measure crown-object-level sensitivity). These observations were meant only to explore sources of error; we relied on the previously described accuracy analyses to estimate model sensitivity.  Results are given for both model sensitivity (a, c, e) and specificity (b, d, f) measured on the spectra from a separate set of crowns. Sensitivity is the proportion of focal class samples that are correctly assigned to the focal class and specificity is the proportion of outlier class samples that are correctly assigned to the outlier class. Note the difference in the y-axis between sensitivity and specificity.  The true-color representation of the raw imagery is on the left-hand side, results from the binary SVM models are in the center, and results from the biased SVM models are on the right-hand side. The three spectral bands used to display the true-color image are R = 640 nm, G = 550 nm, and B = 460 nm.  Our final classification model was found to perform very well, which was especially remarkable considering that it was produced using 138 training crowns from only the species that were mapped. The crown object map that we produced from the classification results was highly reliable in the sense that it had a very low false-positive error rate for predicted crown objects. The classification model had high pixel-level producerâ€™s accuracies for the three focal species, though some of the modelâ€™s sensitivity in detecting the focal species was certainly lost after the contextual filters were applied to the model results to create the map of crown objects. This was evidenced by the fact that omission errors were observed for crowns of each species while we were validating the maps in the field.  The forest of Barro Colorado Island posed several challenges to remote species mapping; namely, high species diversity of the canopy, high prevalence of lianas, and a continuous canopy layer in which individual tree crowns are difficult to distinguish. We attribute the success of remote species mapping in this forest to two main factors: i) a shift from multi-species to single-species classification, and ii) performing species classification at the pixel-level, with crown objects identified after classification.  Here we showed that remote species identification can be successfully achieved in a diverse, closed-canopy tropical forest using high spatial resolution imaging spectroscopy data. We produced an accurate crown object map of three focal species that was found to be very precise. The recently developed biased SVM performed well as the basis for our final multi-species classification model, and its performance was judged superior to the current standard method of binary SVM for our dataset. Thus our final multi-species classification model had the considerable advantage of only requiring representative training data from the species of interest, which can greatly ease the burden associated with producing species classification models, especially in high diversity ecosystems. Our method of producing crown objects from the pixel-level classification results also has implications for automatic tree crown delineation, indicating that individual crowns in can be delineated in high diversity, closed-canopy tropical forests when coupled with species identification. Further experimentation is needed to determine whether these methods will prove useful for remote species mapping in other ecosystems, especially those with high species diversity and a continuous closed canopy.
