Impacts of surface soil organic content on the soil thermal dynamics of alpine meadows in permafrost regions: data from field observationsThe relationship between soil organic matter and soil temperature plays an important role in our understanding of the effect of climate change on the hydrological and carbon cycles in permafrost regions. Several studies have documented that the organic horizon thickness has profound buffering effects on soil temperature for both tundra and boreal forest ecosystems. In the present study, the alpine meadow ecosystem in the middle and low-latitude permafrost region of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP) was selected to examine the impacts of surface soil organic matter on the thermal properties of deep soil. Based on the data obtained from more than 23 observation sites, the relationship between soil organic content and soil temperature dynamics in different seasons was determined. The findings indicate a strong positive exponential (in thawing period) and linear (in freezing period) relationship between surface soil organic content (SOC) and soil temperature dynamics in deep soil layers. The higher SOC at the surface soil layer is associated with a lower rate of soil temperature variation and a later onset time for the thaw–freeze transformation. In permafrost regions of the QTP, the greater lapse rate of soil temperature per 100 m of increased elevation resulted in more significant modification of the SOC and soil thermal relationship in alpine meadows than that in tundra and boreal ecosystems. The coupled soil organic matter, soil thermal and water relationships play an important role in the resilience of permafrost during climate changes.
