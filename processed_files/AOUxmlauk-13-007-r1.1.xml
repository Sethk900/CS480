From 40 individuals sampled in Venezuela during the rainy and dry seasons, we isolated 18 bacterial isolates able to grow on feather meal agar, a medium selective of bacteria capable of extracting energy and nitrogen from feather keratin. Fourteen of these isolates were not previously known to grow on feather keratin.   Bacillus cereus   was the most prevalent, isolated from 85&percnt; of all individuals. Percentage of birds colonized by keratinolytic bacteria, prevalence of the most common bacteria, average number of bacteria species harbored per bird, and average abundance per bird of the most prevalent bacteria were not dependent on season. Capacity to degrade feathers in liquid culture varied extensively among bacterial isolates; four of them were able to noticeably damage feathers, but only   B. cereus   totally disintegrated them in 14 days. Degrading activity of   B. cereus   was as intense as that of our positive control,   B. licheniformis  , well known for its feather-degrading properties. The rest of the bacteria, although showing perceptible growth on feathers, did not visually damage them under our experimental conditions. Contrary to previous studies on wild birds, most feather-degrading isolates (11) in our sample were Gram-negative, likely because our culture protocol was less restrictive than that of previous studies.  Estudiamos la diversidad y abundancia de bacterias queratinol&iacute;ticas hospedadas por el plumaje de   Turdus nudigenis   y sus capacidades de degradar plumas in vitro. Aislamos a partir de 40 individuos, muestreados en Venezuela durante las estaciones lluviosa y seca, 18 aislamientos bacterianos capaces de crecer en agar pluma, un medio selectivo de bacterias capaces de extraer energ&iacute;a y nitr&oacute;geno de la queratina de las plumas. Previamente no se conoc&iacute;a que 14 de estos aislamientos crec&iacute;an con queratina de las plumas.   Bacillus cereus   present&oacute; la prevalencia m&aacute;s alta; fue aislado del 85&percnt; de todos los individuos. El porcentaje de aves colonizadas por bacterias queratinol&iacute;ticas, la prevalencia de la bacteria m&aacute;s com&uacute;n, el n&uacute;mero promedio de especies de bacteria albergado por ave y la abundancia promedio por ave de la bacteria m&aacute;s prevalente no fueron dependientes de la estaci&oacute;n. La capacidad de degradar plumas en un cultivo l&iacute;quido vari&oacute; enormemente entre los aislados bacterianos; cuatro de ellos fueron capaces de da&ntilde;an notoriamente las plumas, pero s&oacute;lo   B. cereus   las desintegr&oacute; totalmente en 14 d&iacute;as. La actividad degradadora de   B. cereus   fue tan intensa como la de nuestro control positivo,   B. licheniformis  , reconocido por sus propiedades degradadoras de plumas. El resto de las bacterias, aunque mostraron un crecimiento perceptible en las plumas, no las da&ntilde;aron de modo visible bajo nuestras condiciones experimentales. De modo contrario a estudios previos en aves silvestres, la mayor&iacute;a (11) de los aislamientos degradadores de plumas en nuestra muestra fueron Gram-negativo, probablemente debido a que nuestro protocolo de cultivo fue menos restrictivo que el de estudios previos.   Palabras clave:  bacteria degradadora de plumas, bacteria queratinol&iacute;tica, queratina,   Turdus nudigenis  , Venezuela  Plumage wear and degradation can deter essential functions of birds such as thermoregulation ( Booth et al. 1993 ), flight performance ( Barbosa et al. 2002 ,  Williams and Swaddle 2003 ), and visual communication ( Shawkey et al. 2007 ,  2009 ). One factor that may have an effect on plumage integrity is the action of microorganisms present in the feathers and skin of birds. Specifically, keratinolytic bacteria, those able to degrade the &beta;-keratin matrix of feathers, are capable of damaging plumage and may influence birds' defense mechanisms ( Burtt and Ichida 1999 ,  Gunderson 2008 ).  Two surveys have indicated that keratinolytic bacteria are diverse and widespread among North American birds.  Burtt and Ichida (1999 ) found feather-degrading bacilli in 38.6&percnt; of 83 species and in six of seven species with large ( n  &gt; 80) sample sizes. The proportion of birds with feather-degrading bacilli varied with time of year and was highest in late fall, when 24&percnt; of all birds sampled were contaminated.  Whitaker et al. (2005 ) isolated putative feather-degrading bacteria (FDB), mostly species of  Bacillus , from 21&percnt; to 59&percnt; of the individuals of each of eight species examined. In both studies,   Bacillus licheniformis  , a thriving soil bacterium, was the most prevalent member of the keratinolytic microbial community.  Among bacteria, keratinases are produced by a number of phylogenetically diverse species often isolated from soil and poultry waste and mostly restricted to the Gram-positive genera  Streptomyces  and  Bacillus  ( Sangali and Brandelli 2000 ,  Brandelli 2008 ). However, recent findings indicate that the diversity of FDB is also associated with Gram-negative bacteria ( Lucas et al. 2003 ,  Brandelli 2008 ,  Bach et al. 2011 ). Research on feather bacteria of wild birds has mainly focused on   B. licheniformis   because of its well-known capacity to disintegrate feathers in liquid culture and because of its widespread occurrence in the plumage of northern temperate birds ( Burtt and Ichida 1999 ,  Shawkey et al. 2003 ,  Whitaker et al. 2005 ,  Reneerkens et al. 2008 ). In these studies, selective incubating conditions, such as prolonged high temperature and a slightly salty and alkaline nutrient broth, favor the growth of   B. licheniformis   while inhibiting growth of other bacteria, including most other bacilli and particularly Gram-negative bacteria ( Whitaker et al. 2005 ).  Feather-degrading activity of bacteria isolated from the plumage of wild birds has been demonstrated experimentally in only a few studies.  Burtt and Ichida (1999 ) found that   B. licheniformis   from 32 species of North American birds degraded, in vitro, secondary feathers of white leghorn chickens.  Shawkey et al. (2003 ) found a high production of keratinase, indicative of feather-degrading activity, in 10 of 13 bacterial isolates from House Finches (  Carpodacus mexicanus  ).  Saag et al. (2011 ) cultivated 18 unidentified FDB phylotypes from wild Great Tits (  Parus major  ) in Estonia, and  Mahler et al. (2010 ) demonstrated feather-degrading activity of several unidentified isolates from the plumage of Shiny Cowbirds ( Molothrus bonariensis ) from temperate and subtropical Argentina. In addition, keratinolytic activity has been demonstrated mostly among   Bacillus   spp. isolated from poultry waste (e.g.,  Williams et al. 1990 ,  Brandelli 2008 ).  In the present study, we (1) inventoried with culture-dependent protocols the naturally occurring FDB from the plumage of wild Spectacled Thrushes (Turdidae:   Turdus nudigenis  ) from northern Venezuela and (2) tested the potential of bacterial isolates to degrade feathers in liquid culture. Inventories of keratinolytic bacteria are an essential first step for gaining insight into the interactions between feather bacteria and birds and determining the proximate and ultimate consequences of such interactions. Nevertheless, the identities of the bacteria that inhabit the feathers of wild birds remain largely unknown ( Shawkey et al. 2005 ), and the present study is the first to look at keratinolytic bacteria in a Neotropical bird. Many previous studies have used culture-based surveys that selectively favor the growth of salt-tolerant, thermophilic bacteria such as   B. licheniformis   (see  Burtt and Ichida 1999 ,  Reneerkens et al. 2008 ). By contrast, we employed more inclusive protocols that allowed growth of other taxa, including mesophilic and Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, we examined the potential effect of season on the prevalence (the percentage of individuals contaminated) and density of keratinolytic bacteria on the plumage of Spectacled Thrushes. Seasonal effects may be important because the warm, moist environments that prevail in the tropical rainy season should favor microbial activity compared with dry periods (e.g.,  Burtt and Ichida 1999 ).  We chose Spectacled Thrushes because they frequently forage on the ground and because they are abundant and easily trappable in mist nets at our study site. Featherborne bacteria, including FDB, have often been isolated from soil ( Brandelli 2008 ), and birds in contact with the ground are more likely to be contaminated by soil bacteria, particularly by feather-degrading   B. licheniformis   ( Burtt and Ichida 1999 ). We anticipated that Spectacled Thrushes would host a diverse community of keratinolytic bacteria and that prevalence would be high because of the species' ground-foraging habits and because warm and humid conditions of tropical lowland habitats may facilitate growth and dispersion of such bacteria.  In northern Venezuela, Spectacled Thrushes are common inhabitants of open forest and second growth, where they forage in the canopy and on the ground for fruit, arthropods, and earthworms ( Meyer de Schauensee and Phelps 1978 ,  Hilty 2003 ). We sampled bacteria from the plumage of 40 birds mist netted in 2008 in deciduous forest remnants near the campus of Universidad Central de Venezuela (10&deg;16&prime;15&prime;&prime;N; 67&deg;36&prime;27&prime;&prime;W; &sim;440 m asl) on the outskirts of the city of Maracay. In this region, yearly rainfall (901 mm) is highly seasonal, most of it (774.5 mm) falling in the 6-mo (May&ndash;October) rainy season ( World Weather Information Service 2011 ). At our study site, Spectacled Thrushes breed from February, in the later part of the dry season, through July and molt between July and November ( Verea et al. 2009 ). They frequently bathe during the rainy season and dust-bathe when dry (C. Verea and C. Bosque personal observation).  To search for plumage bacteria and determine their seasonal occurrence, we sampled 40 unsexed adult birds, 20 toward the end of the dry season (March&ndash;April) and 20 during the rainy season (June&ndash;July). Handling mist-netted birds with sterile latex gloves, we collected from each individual the ninth primaries, the first secondaries, and the outer rectrices from both sides; in addition, we collected a few covert feathers from the head, back, breast, and belly. All feathers are olive-brownish except breast and belly coverts, which are lighter in color. Feathers from each individual were kept together in sealed sterile glass vials to prevent contamination and kept at &sim;4&deg;C for a few hours until processing. We did not sample birds that were molting or that had recently molted wing or tail feathers. All birds were released unharmed after sampling.  Because we did not know what types of bacteria were present in the plumage of Spectacled Thrushes and because our purpose was to isolate cultivable keratinolytic bacteria from those present, we initially cultured bacteria from feather samples in a nutritionally rich generalized Luria-Bartani (LB) medium, from which we could isolate bacteria that degraded feathers. Bacteria from feathers collected from each individual were incubated in 5 mL of sterile LB medium in sterile sealed vials at 37&deg;C for 24 hr. This medium contained 10 g L &minus;1  bacto-tryptone, 5 g L &minus;1  yeast extract, and 5 g L &minus;1  NaCl 5 ( Bertani 1951 ). In all cultures the media became cloudy after 24 hr, indicating bacterial growth.  To isolate FDB and estimate their concentrations in the liquid culture, the bacterial suspension was serially diluted 10&times; in saline (NaCl 0.85&percnt;), and 100 &mu;L of the 1:10,000 dilution was loaded into a micropipetter, discharged onto plates containing feather meal agar (FMA), and raked across the agar plate with a sterile spreader. Plates, in duplicate, from each individual bird, were incubated at 37&deg;C for 24 hr to detect keratinolytic activity ( Williams et al. 1990 ,  Sangali and Brandelli 2000 ). The FMA medium contained 0.4 g L &minus;1  KH 2 PO 4 , 0.3 g L &minus;1  K 2 HPO 4 , 0.3 g L &minus;1  NaCl, 15.0 g L &minus;1  feather meal, and 15.0 g L &minus;1  agar. Feathers from white leghorn chickens, obtained from a poultry processing plant, were washed extensively with water, dried, finely ground, and sterilized by autoclaving at 121&deg;C for 15 min ( Vidal et al. 2000 ). This medium is highly selective for keratinolytic bacteria because its only source of carbon and nitrogen is keratin; hence, only bacteria that are able to digest it can proliferate in it ( Williams et al. 1990 ). However, we did not consider capability to flourish in FMA as indicative of ability to degrade feathers.  After 24&ndash;48 hr of incubation, we counted the number of colony-forming units (cfu) of each morphotype per plate to estimate densities of viable bacteria in the liquid cultures. We distinguished morphotypes on the basis of colony color, shape, size, and presence or absence of mucilaginous (viscid) aspect. Bacterial colonies of single species were obtained by repeatedly scratching the agar surface with a sterile loop onto plates of LB medium. In the case of mixed colonies, single-species isolates were purified by routine procedures, depending on the bacteria involved: Gram negatives mostly by culturing in MacConkey Agar, and bacillus-forming spores by heat shock. We confirmed the purity of isolated colonies through oil-immersion light microscopy and Gram stain. These procedures allowed us to ensure that we were working with individual-species isolates from each individual bird from both seasonal samplings. Isolates were stored at 4&deg;C in LB and FMA agar plates until needed.  Prior to sample collection, we performed two preliminary tests to confirm the selective character of our FMA. In the first test, we inoculated an FMA plate with a strain of   B. licheniformis   (Centro Venezolano de Colecciones de Microorganismos &lsqb;CVCM&rsqb; 586, reconstituted from freeze-dried ATCC 14580), a strain well known for its keratinolytic activity ( Burtt and Ichida 1999 ), and two species for which we had no indication of such activity,   Bacillus pumilus   (CVCM 1696) and   Corynebacterium   sp. (CVCM 1191). After incubation at 37&deg;C for 24 hr, we confirmed that only   B. licheniformis   grew. In the second preliminary test, we inoculated, with 100 &mu;L of the 1:10,000 broth dilution from an individual bird, three plates containing FMA and three plates containing nutrient rich LB medium to confirm that the number of morphotypes growing in LB would be greater than that in FMA. After incubation at 37&deg;C for 24 hr, we confirmed that in fact, the average (&plusmn; SD) number of morphotypes growing in FMA ( x̄  &equals; 2 &plusmn; 0) was smaller than that in LB medium ( x̄  &equals; 6.3 &plusmn; 1.2). Results of both preliminary tests confirmed the selectivity of our FMA medium a priori. In every experiment, we ran one control plate to test for contamination of media.  Identification of pure colonies from each individual bird was based on colony morphology, microscopic examination of Gram-stained cells, and biochemical tests ( Holtz 1997 ,  MacFaddin 2000 ). For each bird, one bacterial isolate of each morphotype was selected at random, removed from cold storage, used to inoculate fresh LB agar plates, and incubated at 37&deg;C for 24 hr before processing. We used the automated ATB-Plus system (Bio-Merieux, Marcy L'Etoile, France) with API galleries (API Coryne, ID 32 GN, ID 32 E, API 20 NE, 50 CHB, and Rapid ID 32 E), depending on the bacteria involved, and following the instructions of the manufacturer. Gallery selection was based on the results of Gram stain and routine tests: catalase, oxidase, lactose, and carbohydrate fermentation, SIM (hydrogen-sulfide, indol, motility), citrate, and urease. The data were read automatically and interpreted with ATB-Plus, version 3.0, allowing for the identification of those isolates in its database. Each isolate was run in duplicate. When identity percentages of the ATB-Plus system indicated an uncertain identification, we carried out complementary tests, indicated by the ATB-Plus system, to confirm identification of the isolate. These tests are specific and included, depending on the taxon involved, nitrate, gelatin, ability to grow in 7.5&percnt; NaCl agar, and/or 50&deg;C, blood agar, MR/VP, of-glucose, bacitracine susceptibility, presence of parasporal crystals, and fresh motility when required, among others ( Gerhardt et al. 1981 ,  Murray et al. 2003 ). Given that defining a bacterial species is far from straightforward ( Horner-Devine et al. 2004 ), in this work we consider bacterial isolates as &ldquo;operational taxonomic units&rdquo; ( Sokal and Sneath 1963 ), defined on the basis of shared biochemical and additional properties just outlined. However, for ease of reading, we refer to them by the binomial names assigned by ATB-Plus.  We assessed feather-degrading properties of each isolate by examining macroscopically its damaging effect on secondary feathers of Spectacled Thrushes in a liquid medium; these feathers were collected from individuals other than those sampled for plumage bacteria. Our procedures basically followed  Burtt and Ichida (1999 ). Feathers were extensively washed in distilled water, and dried and sterilized by autoclaving (121&deg;C, 15 lb in &minus;2 ) for 20 min. We removed and discarded the distal 1 cm from the feather and placed the two adjacent 2-cm-long pieces, cut from the remains, in different test tubes containing 10 mL of basal medium ( Williams and Shih 1989 ,  Williams et al. 1990 ,  Vidal et al. 2000 ). This medium contained 0.5 g L &minus;1  NH 4 Cl, 0.5 g L &minus;1  NaCl, 0.3 g L &minus;1  K 2 HPO 4 , 0.4 g L &minus;1  KH 2 PO 4 , 0.1 g L &minus;1  MgCl 2  6H 2 O, and 0.1 g L &minus;1  yeast extract. The tubes containing the basal medium and feathers were sterilized by autoclaving (121&deg;C, 15 lb in &minus;2 ) for 15 min. Bacterial isolates, whose degrading capacity we intended to assess, were removed from cold storage and used to inoculate fresh LB agar plates. After 24 hr at 37&deg;C, a loopful of bacteria was removed and added to sterile saline until a turbidity comparable to McFarland standard no. 0.5 (corresponding to about 1,5 10 8  cell mL &minus;1 ) was reached. For each isolate, we inoculated 100 &mu;L of the suspension (&ap;150,000 cells) into each of six replicate tubes. The tubes, containing basal medium, a piece of feather, and the bacterial inoculum, were incubated at 37&deg;C with agitation at 60 rpm (New Brunswick Scientific, model TC-7) for 21 days. Tubes were checked every 48 hr and a feather degradation index (FDI), based on visual inspection, was scored on a scale from 0 to 6 according to the following categories:  0: No visible effect on feather; medium remains clear. No indication of bacterial growth.  1: No visible effect on feather but medium becomes turbid, indicative of bacterial growth.  2: A noticeable cloudy veil (or biofilm) over the feather surface; feather not broken.  3: Feather rachis and barbs partially broken but feather remained in a single piece.  4: Feather is fragmented into two to five large separate fragments floating in the medium.  5: Only smaller fragments are floating in medium.  6: Only pieces &le;0.5 mm 2  remain. At this point, we considered that the feather was completely degraded.  We report the modal value of the FDI for each bacterial isolate at the end of the 21-day period, or the average number of days taken to reach FDI &equals; 6 when total degradation was achieved in &lt;21 days in all six replicates. To ensure that experimental isolates were not contaminated and remained viable at the end of the 21-day experimental period, we inoculated LB agar plates with the suspension from every experimental tube and cultured them for 24 hr at 37&deg;C. We then compared Gram stain and colony morphology (by oil-immersion light microscopy) with those of the original isolates. We confirmed that all replicates of every experimental bacterium, as well as negative control 2 (see below), remained viable at the end of the experimental period and that no contamination occurred.  In addition to experimental tests, we ran two negative and one positive control. The first negative control consisted of one tube containing basal medium and a feather piece but no bacterial inoculum (negative control 1 in  Table 1 ). The second negative control was one tube containing basal medium, a feather piece, and an inoculum of a nonkeratinolytic bacterium,   Enterobacter aerogenes   (CVCM 596, reconstituted from freeze-dried ATCC 13048; negative control 2 in  Table 1 ). Preliminary tests indicated that this bacterium was unable to grow on FMA. Our positive control consisted of basal medium, a feather piece, and an inoculum of   B. licheniformis   (CVCM 586, reconstituted from freeze-dried ATCC 14580).  From the plumage of Spectacled Thrushes, we cultured 18 bacterial isolates able to grow on selective FMA ( Table 2 ) whose only nitrogen, carbon, and energy sources were provided by poultry feathers. The average number of bacterial isolates per individual bird was 2.2 &plusmn; 0.45 (range: 1&ndash;3), regardless of season; most individuals (31; 77.5&percnt;) hosted two isolates, and all individuals harbored at least one species (100&percnt; prevalence). Most isolates (11) were enterobacteria, belonging to Enterobacteriaceae (7), Pseudomonaceae (3), and Moraxellaceae (1).   Bacillus cereus   was the most prevalent: It was isolated from 85&percnt; of all birds sampled ( Table 2 ). Most isolates had low prevalence, seven were found only once, and 11 had a prevalence of 5&percnt; or less. Five isolates were isolated from birds trapped during both seasons; nine were present in the dry season only, and four in the rainy season only. Eleven isolates were Gram-negative and seven were Gram-positive ( Table 2 ).  The prevalence (proportion of birds) carrying the two most common bacteria (  B. cereus   and   Enterobacter cloacae  ) was not dependent on season (Fisher exact test,  P  &gt; 0.18 in both cases;  n  &equals; 34 and 12, respectively;  Table 2 ). The prevalence of other bacterial isolates (&lt;10&percnt; overall) was too low for statistical analysis. Likewise, there were no significant differences in the average number of isolates of keratinolytic bacteria harbored per bird during the dry (2.15 &plusmn; 0.49) versus the rainy season (2.20 &plusmn; 0.41;  t  &equals; &minus;0.4, df &equals; 38,  P  &gt; 0.72). Similarly, the average number of cfu per plate per colonized bird, considering only the two most prevalent species,   B. cereus   and   E. cloacae  , was not dependent on season (two-way analysis of variance,  F -ratio &lt; 0.1,  P  &gt; 0.94). Hence, we pooled cfu density estimates from the dry and rainy seasons ( Table 2 ) and made no further attempt to examine seasonality. Relative densities of bacterial isolates were highly variable among colonized individual birds, as indicated by the large standard deviations within bacteria ( Table 2 ). Likewise, there was ample variation in mean density among isolates ( Table 2 ). Among those bacteria with greater prevalence,   E. cloacae   and   Klebsiella pneumoniae   had the highest average densities.  Four bacterial isolates were able to noticeably degrade feathers of Spectacled Thrushes in vitro, but only   B. cereus   was able to fully disintegrate them in &lt;21 days ( Table 1  and  Figure 1 ).   Klebsiella oxytoca  ,   E. cloacae  , and   Hafnia alvei   also display perceptible keratinolytic properties; they were able to fragment feathers into large pieces ( Table 1  and  Figure 1 ). Keratinolytic activity of   B. cereus   was as severe as that of our positive control,   B. licheniformis  , well known for its feather-degrading properties ( Burtt and Ichida 1999 ); both bacilli totally disintegrated feathers in 14 days. The remaining 14 isolates did not visibly fragment feathers (degradation index range: 1&ndash;2;  Table 1 ). Nevertheless, the degradation indices of all 18 bacteria were significantly greater than zero, the score of both negative controls after 21 days of exposure ( Table 1 ; Mann-Whitney one-tailed test,  P  &lt; 0.01 in all cases).  Failure to fully or partially degrade feathers was not due to unviability of bacteria; all inocula from every experimental tube grew rapidly in rich LB medium at the end of the 21-day experimental period. Lack of feather degradation in both the negative controls confirmed that feather damage in experimental tubes was due to the action of bacteria and not to culture conditions.  From the plumage of 40 Spectacled Thrushes, we cultured 18 bacterial isolates belonging to 13 genera capable of growing in FMA, a medium selective for keratinolytic bacteria. Comparable numbers of FDB were isolated in Alabama, USA, from the plumages of Eastern Bluebirds (  Sialia sialis  ;  Shawkey et al. 2005 ) and House Finches ( Shawkey et al. 2003 ,  2009 ) ( n  &equals; 15, 13, and 22, respectively). In Estonia, 18 FDB phylotypes were recorded on 290 wild Great Tits, averaging 2.3 phylotypes bird &minus;1  ( Saag et al. 2011 ). We know of no other inventory that comprehensively describes the diversity of FDB hosted by wild birds using culture-dependent protocols.  Considering that selective cultivation protocols can reveal the presence of only a minor fraction of the bacterial species present ( Amann et al. 1995 ,  Shawkey et al. 2005 ), a significant number of bacteria in our study must have gone undetected. Culture-independent methods should help reveal a considerably larger bacterial diversity than that accounted for by our methods.    Bacillus cereus  , the most ubiquitous and aggressive FDB in our sample, was previously known to have keratinolytic activity; it had been isolated from poultry waste ( Kim et al. 2001 ), soil ( Lucas et al. 2003 ), and wild birds ( Shawkey et al. 2005 ). Except for   B. megaterium   ( El-Shora et al. 1993 ,  Lucas et al. 2003 ),   Stenotrophomonas maltophilia   ( De Toni et al. 2002 ,  Yamamura et al. 2002 ),   Dermacoccus nishinomiyaensis   ( Shawkey et al. 2003 ), and   B. cereus  , the rest (14) of the keratinolytic bacteria reported here were not known to grow on feather meal or to degrade feathers. Interestingly,   B. licheniformis  , the most widespread FDB ( Burtt and Ichida 1999 ,  Whitaker et al. 2005 ), was not found on the plumage of Spectacled Thrushes. Nevertheless, the widespread presence of   B. cereus   was in agreement with the prediction of  Burtt and Ichida (1999 ) that feather-degrading bacilli will be found in all species of birds that are adequately sampled.  It is noteworthy that, contrary to previous studies, most isolates in our sample (11; 61.1&percnt;;  Table 2 ) were Gram-negative. The rest included Gram-positive coccus and bacilli of known keratinolytic activity ( Burtt and Ichida 1999 ,  Shawkey et al. 2003 ). In House Finches the percentage of Gram-negative bacteria able to grow on FMA ranged from only 9.1&percnt; (2 of 22 taxa;  Shawkey et al. 2009 ) to 15.4&percnt; (2 of 13 taxa;  Shawkey et al. 2003 : table 1). In a comprehensive summary of feather bacteria that have keratinolytic activity, 28.6&percnt; (6 of 21 species) were Gram-negative ( Gunderson 2008 :table 1).  Most previous research of feather bacteria has focused on the genus  Bacillus  because, until recently, feather degradation by bacteria had been described mostly for isolates restricted to the genera  Bacillus  and  Streptomyces  ( Sangali and Brandelli 2000 ,  Brandelli 2008 ). Particular focus has been on   B. licheniformis   because of its well-known capacity to disintegrate feathers in liquid culture ( Burtt and Ichida 1999 ). Hence, in many studies of wild birds, selective incubating conditions such as prolonged high temperature (50&ndash;60&deg;C) and a salty and alkaline nutrient broth (7.5&percnt; NaCl, pH 7.5) were designed to favor the growth of   B. licheniformis   ( Burtt and Ichida 1999 ,  Whitaker et al. 2005 ,  Reneerkens et al. 2008 ). However, such conditions also inhibit growth of other bacteria, including most other bacilli and, especially, Gram-negative bacteria ( Whitaker et al. 2005 ). In the present study, we used culture conditions (37&deg;C, pH 7.2) that also favored the growth of a variety of bacilli and of Gram-negative bacteria. Recent evidence indicates that keratinolysis is not limited to Gram-positive bacteria. Several species of mesophilic Gram-negative bacteria tested from laboratory strains ( Allpress et al. 2002 ), isolated from poultry industrial waste ( Sangali and Brandelli 2000 ,  De Toni et al. 2002 ,  Brandelli and Riffel 2005 ,  Riffel and Brandelli 2006 ,  Riffel et al. 2007 ), wild birds ( Shawkey et al. 2003 ,  2005 ,  2009 , present study), soil ( Lucas et al. 2003 ,  Bach et al. 2011 ), and mammalian fur ( Yamamura et al. 2002 ), are currently known to have keratinolytic activity. It is unlikely that the absence of   B. licheniformis   in our samples was due to unfavorable culture conditions, because the isolate that we used as positive control in our experiments readily grew on LB and FMA.  These recent findings suggest that our knowledge of FDB diversity and physiology has been limited by the restrictions and bias of culture methods, and imply that there is an unknown diversity of FDB hosted in feathers. Future protocols in culture-dependent studies of wild birds should be more inclusive, to favor the growth of Gram-negative, mesophilic bacteria, and taxa other than bacilli. The identification of new feather-degrading isolates by culture-dependent techniques is necessary to develop culture-independent methods to examine community diversity of FDB ( Lucas et al. 2003 ), as well as to compare results obtained using the two methodologies ( Shawkey et al. 2005 ). In addition, the search for Gram-negative bacteria from wild birds may have interest for the processing of keratin-rich wastes, because keratinases of Gram-negative bacteria seem to be different from those isolated from Gram-positive bacteria ( Riffel et al. 2003 ,  Brandelli 2008 ,  Bach et al. 2011 ).  All 40 Spectacled Thrushes in our sample hosted at least one keratinolytic bacterial species, and the most prevalent one,   B. cereus  , was isolated from 85&percnt; of the birds. So great an overall prevalence of FDB or of  Bacillus  is uncommon among wild birds. In a sample of 1,588 birds belonging to 83 species of North American birds, the occurrence of keratinolytic bacilli ranged annually from 6.7&percnt; to 10.7&percnt;, depending on season and year ( Burtt and Ichida 1999 ). The greatest prevalence occurred in House Sparrows (  Passer domesticus  ), in which 23&percnt; of individuals had feather-degrading bacilli. Among 461 wild-captured northern temperate birds, putative FDB were isolated from 21&ndash;59&percnt; of individuals of each of eight species examined, and an estimated 27&percnt; of all individuals carried  B. lichenformis  ( Whitaker et al. 2005 ). In Song Sparrows (  Melospiza melodia  ) of the western United States, feather-degrading bacilli occurred in 23&percnt; ( n  &equals; 142) of individuals in humid habitats and in 18&percnt; ( n  &equals; 77) of those in arid environments ( Burtt and Ichida 2004 ).  Burtt and Ichida (1999 ) estimated that an average of 14 individuals would need to be sampled to find one individual with feather-degrading bacilli. These figures contrast with the ubiquitous prevalence of FDB in our Spectacled Thrush sample. Among temperate species, a similar prevalence of FDB (99&percnt; of individuals,  n  &equals; 68) was recorded in another turdid, the Eastern Bluebird, in southern Virginia, USA ( Gunderson et al. 2009 ).  The prevalence of keratinolytic bacteria in our sample agrees with observations that ground-foraging birds such as Spectacled Thrushes have a greater prevalence of feather-degrading  Bacillus  because colonization of the birds' plumage is likely through contact with the soil ( Burtt and Ichida 1999 );   B. cereus   has been isolated from soil samples ( Lucas et al. 2003 ). In addition, high ambient temperatures at our study site throughout the year and high humidity throughout the lengthy rainy season should also favor the growth of bacteria and their successful colonization of plumage.  Season was not important in explaining prevalence, abundance, or diversity of keratinolytic bacteria, although there is a marked seasonality at our study site; the rainy season is followed by a 4-mo dry season during which an average of only 30.3 mm of rain falls in just 9 days ( World Weather Information Service 2011 ). Our results contrast with those of  Burtt and Ichida (1999 ), who found that the prevalence of feather-degrading bacilli in the plumage of eastern North American birds varied with the time of year, likely in relation to humidity and seasonal variations in feather maintenance behavior.  The extent of feather damage in vitro by bacterial isolates was highly variable. At one extreme,   B. cereus   had degrading activity comparable to that of our positive control   B. licheniformis  , seemingly the most aggressive feather-degrading bacillus known. Both bacilli were capable of fully disintegrating Spectacled Thrush feathers in 14 days in liquid culture. At the other extreme, 14 isolates, although showing perceptible growth on feathers, did not visually damage them. An ample range in the production of keratinase, assumed to reveal a bacterium's feather-degrading activity, was also found in vitro among 13 strains of keratinolytic bacteria isolated from House Finches. One of the isolates (  Kocuria rhizophila  ) produced a quantity of keratinase comparable to that of   B. licheniformis  , whereas the rest produced smaller or no detectable amounts ( Shawkey et al. 2003 ).  It is important to note that keratinase production and feather-degrading activity in vitro are not properties of bacteria species only; both also depend on other factors, including bacterial strain, keratin substrate, sterilization method, and culture conditions. For instance,  Burtt and Ichida (1999 ) isolated a strain of   B. subtilis   unable to degrade feathers, whereas  Zerdani et al. (2004 ) and  Macedo et al. (2005 ) reported strains with high levels of keratinolytic activity. Similarly, although several strains of   B. licheniformis   are capable of completely disintegrating feathers, not all strains have keratinolytic activity ( Allpress et al. 2002 ), and their proteolytic enzymes display a broad range of activity ( Lin et al. 1992 ,  Cheng et al. 1995 ,  Brandelli 2008 ). Presence and type of pigment in feathers also are known to affect the resistance of feather keratin to bacterial degradation ( Burtt and Ichida 2004 ,  Grande et al. 2004 ); melanized chicken ( Goldstein et al. 2004 ,  Gunderson et al. 2008 ) and pigmented feathers of parrots ( Burtt et al. 2011 ) are more resistant to hydrolysis by   B. licheniformis   than unmelanized feathers. Likewise, keratinase production and keratin-degrading ability in vitro are also dependent on culture conditions, such as pH, temperature, salinity, and presence of metals and additives ( B&ouml;ckle et al. 1995 ,  Sangali and Brandelli 2000 ,  Allpress et al. 2002 ,  Brandelli and Riffel 2005 ,  Riffel and Brandelli 2006 ,  Brandelli 2008 ). Hence, results from one species or strain of FDB under particular experimental protocols should not be generalized; findings of different studies may not be strictly comparable. Likewise, we cannot assert that bacterial impact in the plumage of free-living birds resembles in vitro bacterial activity.  It is relevant to emphasize that in our experimental protocol, FDB were originally isolated by culturing in selective FMA, whose keratin was provided by white feathers of domestic chickens, whereas our feather-degrading experiments were performed on dark (brownish) secondary feathers of Spectacled Thrushes. It is also important to note that we sterilized feathers by autoclaving, which may make them more readily degradable ( Gunderson et al. 2008 ). In brief, strict comparison of keratinolytic activity of FDB of wild birds is currently complicated by differences in experimental conditions among studies and by the diversity of methods used to estimate feather-degrading activity.  It is not known whether the potential feather-damaging capacity of bacteria in vivo might also be a function of its density or, vice versa, that density might be a function of degrading capacity. Some of the isolates less effective at breaking down feathers in our study were numerically dominant in colonized individuals (e.g.,   K. pneumoniae   and   E. cloacae  ;  Tables 1  and  2 ), having average densities 2&ndash;5 times higher than that of   B. cereus  . Hence, although this is speculative, their great abundance may enhance their effect on the plumage of wild Spectacled Thrushes.  Ours is the first study on the keratinolytic bacterial community of a tropical bird. The results show that Spectacled Thrushes host a diverse, and prevalent, group of bacteria capable of growing in feathers in liquid culture. This result corroborates similar findings among temperate species of birds, although prevalence does not appear to be as great among the latter. Although we cannot assert that keratinolytic bacteria are (or are not) harmful to wild Spectacled Thrushes, the results of our feather-degrading in vitro assays indicate that they are potentially harmful. However, possible fitness consequences of feather damage remain to be investigated. We do not pretend to make a generalized statement about FDB of tropical birds; knowledge of the microbial diversity harbored by plumage and how bacteria interact with birds is just beginning in tropical as well as temperate species.
