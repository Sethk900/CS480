Optimal Water Allocation in Shortage Situations as Applied to an Irrigation CommunityAbstractThis work studies the most beneficial way of allocating water in an irrigation community in water shortage situations. Therefore, it proposes that the irrigation surface area be divided into homogeneous zones, each with a beneficial relationship with respect to the water applied. The mathematical formula that enables one to obtain the optimal quota for the users or irrigation community as a whole has been found for individual relations of a quadratic or power type, and these have yielded different and complementary characteristics. Dimensionless variables have been used to display the results, and to compare with other alternative allocation rules such as the proportional rule, referencing the situation without water restrictions. As a result, for each water shortage situation, the water that is allocated to each user is obtained, together with the losses in individual income and the losses for the community as a whole. Furthermore, a proposal is put forth for establishing the marginal benefit from the water available, which could be of interest in enabling each community to analyze whether it is in its best interest to invest in increasing the resource, or to sell the resource to other users. Finally, an example is given to demonstrate how the method works and to show that, when the differences between the production schemes are considered, the differences in benefit reduction between the proportional allocation and the optimal allocation are also sizeable.
