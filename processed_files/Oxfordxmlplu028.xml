Gibberellin (GA) is one of the plant hormones which regulates many aspects of plant growth and developmental processes. Rice plants known as deepwater rice can survive during flooding by elongating its internodes to avoid anoxia. Previous studies reported that GA is essential for internode elongation in deepwater rice. However, the interaction between internode elongation and regulator of GA sensitivity is unknown. In this study, we performed a QTL analysis and identified the chromosomal regions that regulate GA responsiveness in deepwater rice. We concluded that deepwater rice could induce internode elongation in response to GA by factors in these regions.  Gibberellin (GA) is a plant hormone that has important roles in numerous plant developmental phases. Rice plants known as deepwater rice respond to flooding by elongating their internodes to avoid anoxia. Previous studies reported that GA is essential for internode elongation in deepwater rice. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses identified QTLs regulating internode elongation in response to deepwater conditions. However, the interaction between internode elongation and regulators of GA sensitivity in deepwater rice is unknown. In this study, we applied GA to recombinant inbred lines of T65 (non-deepwater rice) and Bhadua (deepwater rice), and performed a QTL analysis of internode elongation in response to GA. GA-induced internode elongation was detected only in deepwater rice. Our QTL analysis revealed two major QTLs on chromosomes 3 and 9 regulating total internode length, lowest elongated internode and number of elongated internodes. Furthermore, the QTL on chromosome 3 acted as an enhancer of other QTLs (e.g. the QTL on chromosome 12). Nearly isogenic lines of deepwater rice carrying the QTL regions from chromosomes 3 and 12 of the deepwater rice C9285 showed internode elongation in response to GA. Thus, these QTLs may regulate GA responsiveness in deepwater rice. This study furthers our understanding of the mechanism of internode elongation in rice.  The plant hormone gibberellin (GA) regulates many aspects of plant growth, organ development and environmental responses ( Achard and Genschik 2009 ). Among its various functions, GA was initially identified to be involved in the phenomenon of stem and leaf elongation ( Hori 1898 ;  Sawada 1912 ;  Kurosawa 1926 ). In this process of elongation, GA is associated with the regulation of cell division and cell elongation. In non-deepwater rice, GA biosynthesis and signalling occur in elongating and dividing organs and tissues, such as the shoot apex and young leaves ( Kaneko  et al.  2003 ). Additionally, rice internodes start to elongate after initiation of reproductive growth, and expression of genes involved in GA biosynthesis and signal transduction is upregulated in the basal region of the elongating internodes ( Kaneko  et al.  2003 ). In contrast, rice plants known as deepwater rice can induce internode elongation during vegetative growth. Deepwater rice can be cultivated under deepwater conditions. The leaves and internodes of the plants elongate to help keep the top leaves above the water surface and avoid anoxia under deepwater conditions ( Vergara and Mazaredo 1979 ;  Catling 1992 ). Previous physiological studies have suggested that GA is involved in deepwater rice elongation. GA treatment induces internode elongation in deepwater rice under normal conditions, and GA biosynthesis inhibitors (e.g. uniconazol and tetcyclacis) suppress internode elongation in deepwater rice ( Raskin and Kende 1984 ;  Inouye and Kim 1985 ;  Hattori  et al.  2009 ). Additionally, bioactive GA accumulates in deepwater rice under deepwater conditions, but not in non-deepwater rice ( Hattori  et al.  2009 ). These results suggest that GA is essential for internode elongation in deepwater rice. However, GA accumulation does not increase dramatically under deepwater conditions, and a rise in GA content is not sufficient to explain the marked internode elongation of deepwater rice. Deepwater rice may have not only greater GA biosynthesis ability but also higher GA sensitivity than non-deepwater rice. Previously, quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses were performed to detect genetic loci that regulate the deepwater response. Multiple QTLs were detected on chromosomes 1, 3 and 12 by four independent groups using different populations ( Nemoto  et al.  2004 ;  Tang  et al.  2005 ;  Hattori  et al.  2007 ;  Kawano  et al.  2008 ). Moreover, we detected two QTLs on chromosomes 2 and 4 that enhance internode elongation during the early vegetative stage ( Nagai  et al.  2012 ). Among these QTLs, the QTL on chromosome 12, which is most effective for internode elongation, was found to contain  SNORKEL1  ( SK1 ) and  SNORKEL2  ( SK2 ) ( Hattori  et al.  2009 ). These genes encode ethylene-responsive factor-type transcription factors, and their expression is induced by ethylene. However, genes regulating internode elongation in deepwater rice in response to GA have not been identified. In the present study, we performed a QTL analysis of internode elongation in response to GA using recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of rice, Taichung 65 (T65; non-deepwater rice) and Bhadua (deepwater rice), and successfully detected QTLs. We also confirmed the effects of the detected QTLs using nearly isogenic lines (NILs) possessing the QTL regions of C9285, another deepwater rice, in the T65 genetic background.  T65 ( Oryza sativa  ssp.  japonica ), Nipponbare ( O. sativa  ssp.  japonica ), Bhadua ( O. sativa  ssp.  indica ; Bangladesh) and C9285 ( O. sativa  ssp.  indica ; Bangladesh) were used in this study. C9285 was kindly provided by the National Institute of Genetics in Japan ( http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/rice/oryzabase/top/top.jsp ) and maintained at Nagoya University. Nipponbare and T65 were maintained at Nagoya University. Recombinant inbred lines were produced by selfing (nine times) F 1  plants derived from a cross between T65 and Bhadua. NIL3, NIL12 and NIL3–12 possessing the deepwater response QTL on chromosomes 3, 12 and 3/12 in the T65 genetic background were derived previously ( Hattori  et al.  2009 ).  Rice seeds were sterilized by boiling at 60 °C for 10 min. After sterilization, the seeds were allowed to germinate in water at 30 °C for 72 h, and then sown individually in a perforated cell tray (cell size, 2.5 × 2.5 × 4.5 cm) filled with soil. To eliminate the effect of endogenous GA, uniconazole (uni), an inhibitor of GA biosynthesis, was administered with or without GA. For GA and uni treatment, 2 mL of a 10 −1  M GA 3  stock solution and 0.2 mL of a 10 −2  M uni stock solution were added to 2 L of water (final concentration, 10 −4  M GA and 10 −6  M uni). For uni treatment, 0.2 mL of a 10 −2  M uni stock solution was added to 2 L of water (final concentration, 10 −6  M uni). Each solution was used to treat 140 individuals. Seedlings were grown under 16 h of light and 8 h of dark, 70 % humidity, at 25 °C in a phytotron. After 3 weeks, the leaf sheath and internode elongation were measured.  The developmental stage of a rice stem is defined as non-elongation phase, primary phase or secondary phase ( Suetsugu 1968 ). Although internode elongation of &lt;3 mm has been reported in primary phase stems, internode elongation exceeding 5 mm has been observed in secondary phase stems ( Inouye  et al.  1985 ). Deepwater rice enhances secondary phase growth, resulting in elongated internodes in response to deepwater conditions ( Takahashi 1991 ). Based on these reports, we considered internodes longer than 5 mm to be elongated. The main culms of each plant were cut along the midline and total internode length (TIL) was measured. Because plants showing elongation of the lower internodes can increase TIL, lowest elongated internode (LEI) is regarded as an indicator of early internode elongation ability ( Inouye  et al.  1985 ;  Ibi  et al.  1995 ). Lowest elongated internode corresponds to the leaf number. In rice, the culm is characterized by structural superposition, created by the upper and lower nodes, a single internode and a single leaf ( Arikado  et al.  1990 ). Based on these reports, when internode elongation occurred from the internode of the third leaf in the main culm, LEI was considered to be 3. Number of elongated internodes (NEI) was defined as the number of internodes that are longer than 5 mm. The phenotype of each line was based on the average of six plants.  To construct a linkage map, genomic DNA was extracted from 84 individuals of the RIL using the isoplant method ( Zhu  et al.  1993 ). The extracted DNA samples were used for genotyping with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers  [see  Supporting Information ]  using an Affymetrix customized SNP array for rice. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms were detected by the Golden Gate assay of BeadXpress (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). MAPMAKER/EXP, version 3.0 ( Lander  et al.  1987 ) was used to construct the linkage map. R/qtl ( Broman and Sen 2009 ) was used for the QTL analysis. Composite interval mapping (CIM) was used to detect the QTLs. The number of covariates was assumed to be 1. Quantitative trait loci were considered significant at  P  &lt; 0.05, with the logarithm of odds (LOD) score given by 1000 permutation tests ( Churchill and Doerge 1994 ;  Doerge and Churchill 1996 ). A two-QTL scan was performed for the detection of interacting QTLs. Quantitative trait loci were considered significant at  P  &lt; 0.1 using the fitqtl method ( Broman and Sen 2009 ). Candidate QTL regions were identified using the lodint method ( Broman and Sen 2009 ).  Phenotypic evaluation of GA-treated non-deepwater and deepwater rice.

(C) Length of the elongated internode under deepwater conditions. Plants were submerged for 2 weeks and the internode lengths were measured. Error bars indicate ± SD ( n  = 6).  Previously, ethylene-induced internode elongation in deepwater rice was shown to be caused by increased activity of endogenous GA ( Raskin and Kende 1984 ). Additively, a genetic analysis using F 1  plants of the GA biosynthesis-deficient mutant Tan-ginbozu (a weak allele of ent-kaurene oxidase) and Aswina (deepwater rice) suggested that GA is involved in internode elongation in deepwater rice because the F 1  plants showed a semi-dominant internode elongation phenotype under deepwater conditions ( Suge 1987 ).  Kutschera and Kende (1988)  also showed that GA controls the internode profile (e.g. extensibility and osmotic potential for internode elongation) of deepwater rice. Furthermore, the endogenous level of GA was increased in deepwater rice under deepwater conditions, but it did not occur in non-deepwater rice ( Hattori  et al.  2009 ). Non-deepwater rice induced internode elongation during heading time, and the expression of genes involved in GA biosynthesis and signalling factors has been observed in the elongated internodes of non-deepwater rice ( Kaneko  et al.  2003 ). Although previous studies have reported that GA is a critical component of internode elongation in rice, few reports have compared the GA responsiveness of non-deepwater and deepwater rice seedlings ( Inouye and Kim 1985 ). First, to examine the GA responsiveness of non-deepwater rice and deepwater rice, we applied GA to non-deepwater rice and deepwater rice and measured the length of the second leaf sheath and internode. The second leaf sheath elongated in response to GA in both groups of plants (Fig.  1 ). Unexpectedly, whereas deepwater rice induced internode elongation in response to GA, non-deepwater rice did not (Fig.  1 C). These results indicate the presence of factors that regulate internode-specific elongation in response to GA in deepwater rice seedlings. Given not only the deficiency in GA accumulation but also the absence of GA responsiveness in the internodes of non-deepwater rice seedlings, it appears that non-deepwater rice does not exhibit internode elongation in response to deepwater conditions and GA. Taking our results together, we assumed that a novel factor for GA responsiveness must exist.  In this study, CIM and a two-QTL scan for TIL, LEI and NEI detected significant QTLs (Figs  3  and  4 , and Tables  1  and  2 ). Interestingly, QTLs were detected on chromosomes 3, 9 and 12 across three phenotypes by CIM and a two-QTL scan. To evaluate the effects of QTLs on chromosomes 3 and 12, we subjected NIL3, NIL12 and NIL3–12 to GA treatment (Fig.  7 ). Although plants carrying the QTL regions on chromosomes 3 and/or 12 were derived from the deepwater rice C9285, internode elongation was stimulated by GA treatment. In particular, NIL3–12, which has the QTLs on chromosomes 3 and 12, strongly induced internode elongation, as compared with NIL3 and NIL12, which have these QTLs singly. These results are consistent with the phenotypic effects in the T65/Bhadua RIL (Fig.  6 ). Since the NILs and RILs were derived from two different deepwater rice varieties, we conclude that these QTLs can lead to internode elongation in response to GA. In previous studies, QTLs of LEI related to deepwater response were detected on chromosomes 3 and 12 ( Nemoto  et al.  2004 ;  Tang  et al.  2005 ;  Hattori  et al.  2007 ;  Kawano  et al.  2008 ). Because LEI indicated correlations between TIL and NEI, it was proposed that LEI is the most important trait related to internode elongation ability under deepwater conditions ( Inouye 1983 ). In addition, the number of non-elongated internodes was reduced by GA treatment ( Takahashi 1991 ). This result implies that elongation of the lower internode was induced by GA. Additionally, the GA content of deepwater rice was elevated under deepwater conditions ( Hattori  et al.  2009 ). Although internode elongation in NIL3, NIL12 and NIL3–12 was induced under deepwater conditions, the magnitudes of the effects were slight when compared with GA treatment (Fig.  7 ). Taken together, our results suggest that chromosome regions in deepwater rice other than the QTL regions on chromosomes 3 and 12 participate in the accumulation of GA under deepwater conditions; the increase in GA responsiveness caused by the QTLs on chromosomes 3 and 12 promotes the onset of lower internode elongation. Consequently, TIL and NEI are enhanced in deepwater rice. It seems that the slight internode elongation of the NILs under deepwater conditions was due to the poor GA biosynthesis ability of these plants; in comparison, the  SK  genes in the QTL region on chromosome 12 caused the elongation of NIL12 and NIL3–12. To test this hypothesis, it is necessary to measure the GA content in the NILs under deepwater conditions. Meanwhile,  qGTIL4 ,  qGLEI1 ,  qGLEI12  and  qGNEI12  could not be detected without the QTL on chromosome 3 (Table  2 ). This result suggests that the QTL on chromosome 3 acts as a central regulator of GA responsiveness. Previously,  O. sativa - GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR1  ( OsGRF1 ) and 11 homologues were identified ( van der Knaap  et al.  2000 ;  Choi  et al.  2004 ). These genes were expected as transcription activators and their expressions were induced in response to exogenous GA and submergence.  OsGRF1  was expressed in the intercalary meristem of the internode in GA-treated or submerged rice, which preceded the expression of marker genes of cell division such as histone H3 and cyclin transcript  cycOs1  ( van der Knaap  et al.  2000 ). These results imply that  OsGRF1  is involved in GA-dependent stem elongation and meristem maintenance. Although  OsGRF6  and  OsGRF9  were found on chromosome 3, the positions were far from the QTL region on chromosome 3. Hence, the QTL on chromosome 3 is independent of  OsGRF s. A notable QTL was not found in the QTL region on chromosome 9 in the Q-TARO database ( http://qtaro.abr.affrc.go.jp/ ); thus, the QTL on chromosome 9 may be a new QTL that regulates internode elongation in response to GA. However, the sample size in this study was small to perform high-precision QTL analysis ( n  = 84). A small sample size can lead to the identification of false-positive QTLs. Except for the QTLs on chromosomes 3 and 12, further investigation is necessary to confirm the effects of QTLs on chromosome 9 as well as on the other chromosomes. We previously identified two genes located in the QTL on chromosome 12 that influence the deepwater response,  SK1  and  SK2 . Notably,  SK s were absent in non-deepwater rice ( Hattori  et al.  2009 ). These  SK s encode transcription factors possessing an AP2/ERF domain. Only ethylene treatment induced  SK  upregulation; exogenous GA and other phytohormones did not influence  SK  expression ( Hattori  et al.  2009 ). Although the position of the QTL on chromosome 12 in this study overlapped with the  SK  region, the peak of this QTL was at a distance (Fig.  3 ;  Hattori  et al.  2007 ,  2009 ). On the other hand,  OsGRF7  was located close to the peak. Hence, it is possible that  OsGRF7  on chromosome 12 regulates GA responsiveness for internode elongation.  Previous studies elucidated the GA signalling pathway and downstream factors. Among these, DELLA proteins, which are key regulators of GA signalling, have been characterized in genetic and biochemical studies ( Ikeda  et al.  2001 ;  Itoh  et al.  2002 ;  Sasaki  et al.  2003 ;  Ueguchi-Tanaka  et al.  2007 ). In the absence of GA, DELLA proteins function as repressors, leading to plant growth suppression. The DELLA proteins are degraded by 26S proteasome in the presence of GA, and plant growth is released from DELLA suppression. Further, recent reports have suggested that not only DELLA degradation but also DELLA interactions with other factors regulate plant growth, including hypocotyl elongation, GA-jasmonate or -ethylene crosstalk, and seed germination ( Zhang  et al.  2011 ;  Cheminant  et al.  2011 ;  An  et al.  2012 ;  Yang  et al.  2012 ). A DELLA-independent GA response has also been demonstrated ( Fuentes  et al.  2012 ). Based on these reports, the QTL on chromosome 3 and other QTLs may regulate the DELLA function or act downstream of GA signalling. It is also possible that these QTLs induce the formation of a structure that enables internodes to respond to GA.  In conclusion, our data showed the presence of factors that regulate internode-specific elongation in response to GA in deepwater rice seedlings. The QTL analysis demonstrated that QTLs on chromosomes 3 and 9 are the main regulators of internode elongation and several QTLs are involved in internode elongation in response to GA (e.g. the QTL on chromosome 12). We previously produced mapping populations for the QTLs on chromosomes 3 and 12. Ongoing studies using these populations will identify genes at each QTL that are responsible for internode elongation in rice. In addition, our data may contribute to the breeding of rice that is adapted for survival in long-term flood areas by raising GA responsiveness.
