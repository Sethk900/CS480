Evidence of a germination inhibitor in senescent soybean pod wallsWater based pod extracts of the pod wall material of four soybean cultivars were found to reduce the germination rate of mustard (Sinapis alba L.) seeds. Highly significant differences were also observed in this respect between the different pod extracts. These results indicated the presence of a germination inhibitor in senescent soybean pod walls which might provide some protection against the effects of field weathering of soybean seeds.
