Serological response against myxoma virus and rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus in European wild rabbits using commercial vaccines.We carried out an experimental study to determine the serological response against myxoma virus (MV) and rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) in wild rabbits using commercial vaccines. Seroconversion against MV ranged between 72.7% and 97.2% in animals vaccinated by subcutaneous and intradermal route, respectively, whereas between 75.0% and 77.8% of the animals presented antibodies against RHDV after inoculation with subcutaneous and intradermal vaccines, respectively. Regardless of the inoculation route, vaccination against MV resulted in a significant increase of seropositivity 5 days post-vaccination (dpv), which did not occur in animals vaccinated against RHDV. Furthermore, seroconversion against MV was significantly higher and faster in intradermally vaccinated rabbits as compared to those inoculated subcutaneously due to either the route of application and/or the type of vaccine used. The results indicated that vaccination significantly increased the prevalence of antibodies against MV and RHDV and suggested that the vaccines currently available induce a safe and effective immune response against both diseases in wild rabbits. Vaccination may be a useful management tool to control both viral diseases in field conditions, particularly in wild rabbits captured for translocations and restocking purposes in which a large number of animals are handled.
