UV-B has larger negative impacts on invasive populations of               Triadica sebifera               but ozone impacts do not varyAims Abiotic stresses may interact with each other to determine impacts on plants so that their combined impact is less than or more than additive. Increasing UV-B radiation and surface ozone (O3) are two major components of global change that may have such interactive impacts. Moreover, invasive and native populations of plants may respond differently to stresses as they can vary in primary and secondary metabolism.
