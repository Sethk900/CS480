The relationship between the water level of the Amazon River and the fate of the zooplankton population in lago Jacaretinga. A V√°rzea Lake in the Central AmazonSummary In a v√°rzea lake of the Central Amazon the planktonic crustaceans disappear almost completely after the inflow of suspension‚Ärich Amazon water. An initial small increase in numbers of individuals is accompanied by increased egg production in Diaphanosoma sarsi and Notodiaptomus amazonicus, suggesting an improved food supply for the Zooplankton. Possible reasons for the complete disappearance of the crustaceans are discussed, these being a dilution effect, flushing out of the plankton by the current, and predation of planktivorous fish.
