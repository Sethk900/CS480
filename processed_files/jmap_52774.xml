Small-Scale Shrimp Grower–Collector Relationships: The Case of Thua Thien Hue Province, Central VietnamSmall-scale shrimp-culture is an important livelihood for rural residents in Thua Thien Hue (TTH) province, central Vietnam. However, they are facing the risk of exclusion from the food system due to globalization and trade liberalization. To keep these farmers in modern supply chains, their relationships with other chain actors, foremost the collectors, need to be improved. Thus, this study explores the characteristics and constructs of the relationships between the small-scale shrimp growers and their collectors. Data was based on a survey on 83 small-scale shrimp growers, together with 16 unstructured interviews with growers (10) and collectors (6). It was revealed that the relationships between small-scale shrimp growers and collectors in TTH province are short-term and price-driven and are influenced by the power of collectors. The relationship strength was measured by five intercorrelated constructs including reliability, willingness-to-maintain, desire-fulfilment, negotiation capacity, and discussion capacity. Although some constructs were positively correlated, the strength of the relationships was weak. Both business linkages and social connections affected the grower-collector relationships. Female traders had stronger relationships with collectors than males. Therefore, interventions should be focused on business and social linkages as well as females’ involvement in shrimp trade.
