Springtime Snowmelt and Streamflow Predictions in the Himalayan MountainsAbstractPerennial rivers (i.e., the Indus, the Ganges, the Brahamputra) originating from the Himalayas are fed by temperature-induced snowmelt, rainfall, and base flow. Daily, weekly, or monthly streamflows of non-monsoon periods are critical for about a billion people living in these perennial river basins for water supply, irrigation, hydropower, and other water needs. The streamflow in snow and glacier dominated watersheds are affected mainly by solar energy and temperature. The existing models for streamflow and snow depth estimation are tedious and lack reliability. The impact of climate change has further enhanced the uncertainty. The springtime streamflow for the study area has increased by 2% yearly due to changes in climate during the last 25 years. The paper describes a nomogram, which combines the effect of climate change, temperature, and melting snow depth to estimate the daily average flow/discharge during spring time for a subbasin in the Himalayas. The concept is simple and uses location-specific regressed weekly main temperature, snow depth and discharge during ablating snowpack. The analysis focused on 3 typical years (1983, 2003, and 2008) and an average of 5–6 years during the spring period. The results of the study indicate a shift in temperature trend over the years and identify critical temperatures influencing the rate of snowmelt. The use of the temperature trendline has improved the streamflow simulation and further adaptation of average conditions under the changing climate and human influences in the region has enhanced the predictability of snowmelt/runoff. The glacier melts mostly occur in the summer-monsoon season so this trend cannot be addressed here with the springtime data set. However, a similar nomogram can be prepared for the summer-monsoon season if there is a snow cover area (SCA) of more than 50%.
