Key metabolites in tissue extracts of Elliptio complanata identified using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopyWe used 1H-NMR to describe the freshwater mussel metabolome. Muscle, digestive gland, mantle and gill tissues yielded profiles with possible biomarkers of physiologic function. These preliminary studies provide evidence for potential use of digestive gland and mantle tissue for studying physiological impacts of location, sex and reproductive condition on Elliptio complanata. We used 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to describe key metabolites of the polar metabolome of the freshwater mussel, Elliptio complanata. Principal components analysis documented variability across tissue types and river of origin in mussels collected from two rivers in North Carolina (USA). Muscle, digestive gland, mantle and gill tissues yielded identifiable but overlapping metabolic profiles. Variation in digestive gland metabolic profiles between the two mussel collection sites was characterized by differences in mono- and disaccharides. Variation in mantle tissue metabolomes appeared to be associated with sex. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a sensitive means to detect metabolites in the tissues of E. complanata and holds promise as a tool for the investigation of freshwater mussel health and physiology.
