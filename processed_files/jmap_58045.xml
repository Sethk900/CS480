Modeling of Event and Continuous Flow Hydrographs with HEC–HMS: Case Study in the Kelani River Basin, Sri LankaAbstractThis paper describes a case study of event and continuous hydrologic modeling in the Kelani River basin in Sri Lanka using the Hydrologic Engineering Center—Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC–HMS). An extremely high rainfall event in November 2005 was used to calibrate model parameters, and extremely high rainfall events in April–May 2008, May–June 2008, and May 2010 were used to validate the event model. The calibrated, direct runoff and base flow parameters were then used in the continuous hydrologic model. The Green and Ampt infiltration loss method was used to account for infiltration loss in event-based modeling and a five-layer soil moisture accounting loss method was employed in continuous modeling. The Clark unit hydrograph method and the recession base flow method were used to simulate direct runoff and base flow, respectively. The results depict the capability of HEC–HMS to reproduce streamflows in the basin to a high accuracy with averaged computed Nash–Sutcliffe efficiencies of 0.91 for event–based simulations and 0.88 for continuous simulations. Simulated river flows affirm that the event-based hydrologic modeling supported by intensive field data is useful to derive calibrated parameters for continuous hydrologic modeling. The study demonstrates potential HEC–HMS application in disaster mitigation, flood control, and water management in medium-size river basins in tropical countries.
