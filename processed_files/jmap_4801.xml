Nesting territory characteristics of a migratory South American forest hawk, the White-throated Hawk (Buteo albigula) (Aves: Accipitridae), in temperate rainforest remnants of Araucanía, southern ChileDuring four successive breeding periods (2007–11) we characterized the nesting territories of the white-throated hawk (Buteo albigula) in southern Chile. Territories were located in mountainous areas with mature native forest (n = 17) or mature pine plantations (n = 1). Most of the territories were distant from urban centres (>2 km). Only one or two adult hawks and one young per pair/year were observed in each territory. All nest sites were located in the upper parts of ravines. Nests were built on large, living mature trees. Platforms were bulky (>50 cm diameter) and oval or round. Eggs were white and subelliptical in shape (40.0 × 50.0 mm). Hawk pairs reproduced asynchronically extending the reproductive period for 6 months. Although some white-throated hawk pairs were tolerant of human-modified habitats, it is possible that decline in forest cover represents a potential threat for the population viability of this migratory forest hawk.
