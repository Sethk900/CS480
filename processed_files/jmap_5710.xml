Allopatric differentiation in the Marcusenius macrolepidotus species complex in southern and eastern Africa: the resurrection of M. pongolensis and M. angolensis, and the description of two new species (Mormyridae, Teleostei)We critically compared local populations of the bulldog fish, Marcusenius macrolepidotus (Peters 1852), from different watersheds, from the furthest south (28Â° South, South Africa) to the Equator in Kenya. We ascertained allopatric differentiation from topotypical M. macrolepidotus from the Lower Zambezi River (Mozambique) in morphology, electric organ discharges, and molecular genetics for: (1) samples from the Okavango and Upper Zambezi Systems (Botswana and Namibia), (2) samples from South Africa's rivers draining into the Indian Ocean, and (3) samples from the East African Tana River (Kenya). Significant genetic distances in the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and differing ISSRâ€PCR profiles corroborate differentiation between the four taxa. We resurrect M. pongolensis (Fowler, 1934) for South Africa (sample 2), and M. angolensis (Boulenger, 1905) for the Quanza River/Angola. We recognize M. altisambesi sp. n. for the Upper Zambezi/Okavango specimens (sample 1), and M. devosi sp. n. for those from Kenya (sample 3).
