Eutrema salsugineum (Cruciferae) new to Mexico: a surprising generic record for the flora of Middle AmericaThe paper reports Eutrema salsugineum as a novelty to the flora of Mexico and Middle America in general. The finding stands ca. 1600 km apart from the closest known locality in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, USA. The species is considered native to NW Mexico and its late discovery in the region is presumably explained by its tiny habit, early flowering time, and subephemeral life cycle. The phylogenetic position of this Mexican population in a haplotype network based on the chloroplast DNA fragment psbA-trnH confirms this hypothesis and also suggests, in contrast to the previously held viewpoint, multiple colonizations of North American continent from Asia.
