Estimation of potential and actual evapotranspiration of boreal forest ecosystems in the European part of Russia during the HoloceneA simple regression model for calculating annual actual evapotranspiration (ET) and potential evapotranspiration (PET), as well as annual transpiration (TR) of mature boreal forests grown in the European part of Russia in the Holocene using paleoclimatic and paleobotanical data (air temperature, precipitation, forest species compositions) is presented. The model is based on nonlinear approximations of annual values of ET, TR and PET obtained by the Levenberg–Marquardt method using the results of numerical simulations of ET, TR and PET provided by a process-based Mixfor-SVAT model for forests with different species compositions under various thermal and moistening conditions. The results of ET, TR and PET reconstructions for the Holocene show large variability and high correlation with the air temperature pattern. Minimal values of ET and PET are obtained for the Younger Dryas cold phase (11.0–10.0 14C kyr BP) when ET varied between 320 and 370  mm yr – 1 and PET varied between 410 and 480 mm yr – 1. During the Late Atlantic periods of the Holocene (4.5–5.1 14C kyr BP), ET and PET reached maximal values (ET: 430–450  mm yr – 1 and PET: 550–570 mm yr – 1).
