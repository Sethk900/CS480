Our analysis indicated that all eight microsatellites are promising for assessing population genetics questions in this species.<italic>Manilkara multifida</italic> is a tropical tree that is endemic to the Atlantic forests of southern Bahia, Brazil. Currently, populations of this species are restricted to fragmented landscapes that are susceptible to anthropogenic disturbances. Considering this issue, and that there is no genetic information available for this endangered species, we developed microsatellite markers for <italic>M. multifida</italic> to provide resources for future conservation genetics studies. Using an enriched genomic library, we isolated eight polymorphic microsatellite loci and optimized the amplification conditions for <italic>M. multifida</italic>. For each locus, we estimated the number of alleles, <italic>H</italic><sub>E</sub> and <italic>H</italic><sub>O</sub>, paternity exclusion <italic>Q</italic>, individual identity <italic>I</italic> and fixation index <italic>F</italic>, and examined the presence of null alleles. The mean number of alleles was 11.9, and the heterozygosity was high at all loci (average <italic>H</italic><sub>E</sub> = 0.809 and <italic>H</italic><sub>O</sub> = 0.777). The combined values for both paternity exclusion and individual identity were <italic>Q</italic> = 0.9959 and <italic>I</italic> = 5.45 × 10<sup>–11</sup>, respectively. No evidence of null alleles was detected. The results of our analysis indicated that all eight microsatellites are promising for assessing questions involving inbreeding, gene flow, co-ancestry and mating patterns in <italic>M. multifida</italic>.The Atlantic Forest is the second largest tropical forest in South America. Its original area measured ∼1 500 000 km<sup>2</sup> ranging along the Brazilian Atlantic coast, with additional patches in Argentina and Paraguay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT006C11">Ribeiro <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Currently, only 11.4–16% of its original cover remains, and it is distributed in a fragmented landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT006C11">Ribeiro <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>) as a consequence of land use and occupation. Most Brazilians live in areas that were originally covered by the Atlantic Forest, which increases the pressure on native forest species. Southern Bahia, Brazil, is a particularly diverse region of the Atlantic Forest, especially in terms of tree species, and for many years, inadequate forest management and agriculture intensification reduced the amount of forest cover as well as the abundance of tree species. During the 1970s, the timber industry alone caused major environmental damage in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT006C7">Mesquita 1997</xref>), and several species, including <italic>Manilkara multifida</italic> Penn., suffered a significant reduction in that period due to the high commercial value of their timber.<italic>Manilkara multifida</italic> is a rare tree species endemic to the Atlantic Forest of southern Bahia, and it is included on the IUCN Red List as an endangered species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT006C8">O'Brien 1998</xref>). Members of the genus <italic>Manilkara</italic> are known to provide important food resources for primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT006C9">Oliveira <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>), but there are no data about the functional and evolutionary role of <italic>M. multifida</italic> in its habitat. Trees of this species are lactescent and have flowers with red sepals and white petals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT006C10">Pennington 1990</xref>). They can also be identified by their wide and discolorous leaves, which are covered by an adpressed indumentum on the abaxial face, and by their numbers of petals, stamens and staminoids (8–9 altogether) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT006C10">Pennington 1990</xref>). In the present study, we report the development and characterization of the first microsatellite markers for <italic>M. multifida.</italic> This resource will help researchers obtain experimental data for the elaboration of genetic inferences that will contribute to conservation programmes for this species.A genomic library was constructed from template DNA (250 ng μL<sup>−1</sup>) extracted via the cetyl trimethylammonium bromide method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT006C2">Doyle and Doyle 1990</xref>). Isolated DNA was digested with the restriction enzyme RsaI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Fragments of between 200 and 800 bp were captured and linked to the adapters Rsa21 and Rsa25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT006C3">Edwards <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>) using T4 DNA ligase. The DNA fragments containing microsatellites were captured by hybridization with biotinylated probes (CT)<sub>8</sub> and (GT)<sub>8</sub>, and recovered using magnetic streptavidin beads (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). These fragments were then amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) according to the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95°C for 1 min; 25 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 40 s, annealing at 60 °C for 40 s and extension at 72 °C for 2 min; and final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. Amplicons were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), which was then transformed into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> XL1-Blue (Promega). A set of 96 positive clones was amplified using M13 primers and Big Dye<sup>®</sup> Terminator reagents (version 3.1; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and sequenced using a DYEnamic<sup>TM</sup> kit (GE Healthcare). Among these, 22 clones were discarded due to low-quality sequencing data (chromatograms). We analysed the remaining 74 sequences using SSRLocator software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT006C5">Maia <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>) and detected 67 containing microsatellites. A total of 14 pairs of primers were designed using Primer3 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT006C12">Rozen and Skaletsky 2000</xref>).We tested the optimized primers in two steps: PCR amplification and electrophoretic analysis. The PCR reactions contained genomic DNA (7.5 ng), ultrapure water, 1× buffer (Fermentas), bovine serum albumin (2.5 ng µL<sup>−1</sup>), dNTPs (2.5 mM), MgCl<sub>2</sub> (25 mM), tailed M13 forward and reverse primers (10 µM) labelled with DS-33 fluorescent dyes (NED<sup>TM</sup>, 6-FAM<sup>TM</sup>, PET<sup>®</sup> or VIC<sup>®</sup> dyes; Applied Biosystems) and <italic>Taq</italic> DNA polymerase (1 U). Reactions were carried out in a BioEr LifePro thermal cycler under the following conditions: 94 °C for 3.5 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, <italic>T</italic><sub>a</sub> °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 15 min. Eight primer pairs successfully amplified DNA fragments from samples from 32 <italic>M. multifida</italic> individuals from the RPPN Estação Veracel (Porto Seguro, Bahia, Brazil) and Reserva Biológica de Una (Una, Bahia, Brazil) conservation units. The sizes of the labelled amplified fragments were determined by capillary electrophoresis (ABI 3130XL Genetic Analyzer) with the internal size standard GS500 LIZ (Applied Biosystems) using GeneMapper software (Applied Biosystems).We assessed paternity exclusion <italic>Q</italic>, diversity indices <italic>H</italic><sub>E</sub> and <italic>H</italic><sub>O</sub>, and allelic identity (<italic>I</italic>) using Cervus 3.0.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT006C6">Marshall <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>). We also computed the fixation index (<italic>F</italic>) in FSTAT 2.9.3.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT006C4">Goudet 2002</xref>) and examined for null alleles using Micro-Checker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLT006C13">Van Oosterhout <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>).Description of the eight nuclear SSR markers developed for <italic>M. multifida</italic> in the present study, with forward (F) and reverse (R) sequences, repeat motif, annealing temperature and size range.<bold>Population genetic parameters calculated for eight microsatellite loci developed for <italic>M. multifida</italic>: number of alleles (Na), expected heterozygosity (<italic>H</italic><sub>E</sub>), observed heterozygosity (<italic>H</italic><sub>O</sub>), paternity exclusion index (<italic>Q</italic>), identity analysis (<italic>I</italic>), and fixation index (<italic>F</italic>)</bold>.<sup>a</sup>Combined exclusion probability.<sup>b</sup>Combined estimation.The eight polymorphic microsatellite markers developed in this study display important discrimination capacities.
