A new species and illustrated records of Paracyclops Claus, 1893 (Copepoda: Cyclopoida: Cyclopinae) from MexicoA new species of the freshwater cyclopid genus Paracyclops Claus, 1893 collected from the state of Aguascalientes, Mexico is described based on female and male specimens. It has affinities with other forms with profusely ornamented caudal rami, such as Paracyclops carectum Reid and Paracyclops pilosus Dussart, but it can be distinguished by a combination of characters including details of the ornamentation of the coxa of leg 1, third antennular segment with incomplete suture line, inner margin of the caudal rami with scattered hair-like elements, and relatively long caudal rami, among other characters. The male is distinguished mainly by having the caudal rami completely covered by pilosity, which differs from all other known Paracyclops, including Paracyclops carectum. The new species has affinities with neotropical Paracyclops. Illustrated records and a morphological analysis of two more species of Paracyclops from Mexico, Paracyclops poppei and Paracyclops chiltoni, are also included in this contribution.
