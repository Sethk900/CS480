South-western Australia harbours a biodiversity hotspot on severely phosphorus-impoverished soils. Threats include eutrophication due to phosphorus enrichment, due to increased fire frequency and spraying with phosphite to reduce the impacts of the introduced pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi. We propose a strategy to work towards alternatives to phosphite for pathogen management.  South-western Australia harbours a global biodiversity hotspot on the world's most phosphorus (P)-impoverished soils. The greatest biodiversity occurs on the most severely nutrient-impoverished soils, where non-mycorrhizal species are a prominent component of the flora. Mycorrhizal species dominate where soils contain slightly more phosphorus. In addition to habitat loss and dryland salinity, a major threat to plant biodiversity in this region is eutrophication due to enrichment with P. Many plant species in the south-western Australian biodiversity hotspot are extremely sensitive to P, due to a low capability to down-regulate their phosphate-uptake capacity. Species from the most P-impoverished soils are also very poor competitors at higher P availability, giving way to more competitive species when soil P concentrations are increased. Sources of increased soil P concentrations include increased fire frequency, run-off from agricultural land, and urban activities. Another P source is the P-fertilizing effect of spraying natural environments on a landscape scale with phosphite to reduce the impacts of the introduced plant pathogen  Phytophthora cinnamomi , which itself is a serious threat to biodiversity. We argue that alternatives to phosphite for  P. cinnamomi  management are needed urgently, and propose a strategy to work towards such alternatives, based on a sound understanding of the physiological and molecular mechanisms of the action of phosphite in plants that are susceptible to  P. cinnamomi . The threats we describe for the south-western Australian biodiversity hotspot are likely to be very similar for other P-impoverished environments, including the fynbos in South Africa and the cerrado in Brazil.

Note the relative abundance of non-mycorrhizal species on soils with the lowest phosphorus content. Modified after  Lambers  et al.  (2010) .  Two major threatening processes affect the biodiversity in the south-western Australian biodiversity hotspot and similar severely P-impoverished regions elsewhere in the world  Several factors can lead to eutrophication, some of which are discussed in detail. Physiological studies allow a better understanding of plant responses to threatening processes. These should ultimately guide management options with conservation outcomes. The physiological studies that are listed are discussed in the main text.  A plant family that is richly represented on severely P-impoverished soils in south-western Australia and similar landscapes in South Africa is the Proteaceae ( Cowling and Lamont, 1998 ). Proteaceae species occur as major ecosystem components, often as keystone species. They are evergreen woody plants, ranging in size from prostrate shrubs to trees ( Cavanagh and Pieroni, 2006 ;  Collins  et al. , 2008 ). After fires, Proteaceae species regenerate either by sprouting epicormic shoots or by releasing seed from woody follicles ( Lamont and Markey, 1995 ). Proteaceae species contribute prominently to ecosystem functioning, such as fixation of carbon, provision of an architectural structure or habitat, and sharing and recycling of resources to minimize net nutrient loss, especially, from the system ( Shearer  et al. , 2009 ,  2012 ). Flowers provide food for birds, mammals, and insects ( Hopper, 1980 ;  Whelan and Burbidge, 1980 ;  Ladd  et al. , 1996 ;  Cavanagh and Pieroni, 2006 ;  Collins, 2008 ).  Most of the species in the Proteaceae family produce proteoid roots ( Purnell, 1960 ) and almost all of them are non-mycorrhizal ( Shane and Lambers, 2005a ). An exception is the cluster-rooted mycorrhizal species  Hakea verrucosa , which grows on ultramafic rocks that are rich in nickel ( Boulet and Lambers, 2005 ). The release of carboxylic acids from its cluster roots would increase the solubility of nickel and harm the plants; in addition, mycorrhizal associations may protect plants to some degree against metal toxicity (e.g.  Schutzendubel and Polle, 2002 ;  Christophersen  et al. , 2009 ). Proteoid roots are dense clusters of rootlets of determinate growth, which develop numerous root hairs ( Lamont, 2003 ;  Shane and Lambers, 2005a ). Given that proteoid roots are not restricted to Proteaceae, the term ‘cluster roots’ is commonly used as an alternative ( Shane and Lambers, 2005a ). Cluster roots release vast amounts of carboxylates in an exudative burst ( Watt and Evans, 1999 ;  Shane  et al. , 2004a ); the carboxylates mobilize P that is sorbed onto soil particles, making it available for uptake by plant roots ( Lambers  et al. , 2006 ). Therefore, cluster roots effectively mine P that is unavailable for plants lacking this strategy. Outside the Proteaceae, cluster roots in Australia are found in Casuarinaceae ( Reddell  et al. , 1997 ), Fabaceae ( Lamont, 1972 ), and Restionaceae ( Lambers  et al. , 2006 ). Cluster-root formation is suppressed in the presence of a high P supply ( Watt and Evans, 1999 ;  Shane and Lambers, 2005a ), highlighting their important role for P uptake.  Dauciform (i.e. carrot-shaped) roots occur in some tribes of the non-mycorrhizal family Cyperaceae ( Davies  et al. , 1973 ;  Lamont, 1974 ;  Shane  et al. , 2006b ), another common family on nutrient-impoverished soils. Dauciform roots were probably first recognized for  Schoenus ferrugineus  (Cyperaceae) by  Renner (1935) , who thought they were a mycorrhizal structure (Pilzwurzel). Thereafter, they were described by Russian researchers ( Selivanov and Utemova, 1969 ). Dauciform roots are morphologically very different from cluster roots, but functionally quite similar; they also release vast amounts of carboxylates in an exudative burst ( Playsted  et al. , 2006 ;  Shane  et al. , 2006a ), and are suppressed in the presence of a high P supply ( Shane  et al. , 2006a ).  Large amounts of carboxylates can also be exuded in the absence of specialized structures such as cluster roots and dauciform roots, e.g. in a range of  Kennedia  species (Fabaceae) from south-western Australia ( Ryan  et al. , 2012 ). These species without cluster roots differ vastly in the amount of carboxylates they release, but what they have in common is that their carboxylate exudation is reduced in the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, which colonize the roots of some  Kennedia  species ( Ryan  et al. , 2012 ). This suggests a trade-off in plant carbon allocation for P acquisition to either mycorrhizal fungi or carboxylate release.  Manganese (Mn) accumulation is common in Proteaceae ( Jaffré, 1979 ;  Shane and Lambers, 2005b ;  Rabier  et al. , 2007 ;  Fernando  et al. , 2010 ), as well as in Fabaceae with cluster roots, e.g.  Lupinus albus  ( Gardner  et al. , 1982 ) and  Aspalathus lineari s ( Morton, 1983 ). This is explained by the ability of their cluster roots to mobilize Mn ( Gardner  et al. , 1981 ;  Grierson and Attiwill, 1989 ;  Dinkelaker  et al. , 1995 ). Leaf [Mn] might therefore provide an indication of the extent to which roots depend on carboxylate release to acquire P ( Shane and Lambers, 2005b ). Following this reasoning, we found that cluster-rooted Proteaceae and dauciform-rooted Cyperaceae along a 2 million year chronosequence ( Laliberté  et al. , 2012 ) have higher leaf [Mn] than their neighbours without any of the carboxylate-releasing strategies discussed above, regardless of soil age and P status (P. Hayes, E. Laliberté and H. Lambers, unpublished observations). We also found the same phenomena in non-mycorrhizal species that produce sand-binding roots. It is therefore likely that the functional significance of sand-binding roots ( Shane  et al. , 2011 ;  Smith  et al. , 2011 ) within an ecosystem is also, at least partly, that of mobilizing P through carboxylate release, but this requires further research.  The high abundance of Proteaceae in severely P-impoverished landscapes is not accounted for exclusively by their very efficient P-acquisition strategy. In addition, at least three other traits determine their P efficiency. First, their P-use efficiency in photosynthesis is amongst the highest ever recorded ( Wright  et al. , 2004 ;  Denton  et al. , 2007 ), which is partly accounted for by extensive replacement of phospholipids by lipids that do not contain P during leaf development ( Lambers  et al. , 2012 ). However, the decline in leaf P concentration during leaf development must also involve other metabolic changes, because the replacement of phospholipids is too small to explain the decrease entirely. Second, their long-lived leaves are very efficient and proficient at remobilizing P during leaf senescence ( Denton  et al. , 2007 ), which greatly increases the mean residence time of P within the plant. Third, their seeds, unlike their vegetative tissues, contain very high concentrations of P ( Denton  et al. , 2007 ;  Groom and Lamont, 2010 ), allowing seedlings to grow without an external P source for a prolonged period ( Milberg and Lamont, 1997 ).  Whilst Proteaceae and several other species that are endemic to south-western Australia and similar P-impoverished landscapes are very good at acquiring P and using it efficiently, many are extremely sensitive to P and readily display P-toxicity symptoms ( Handreck, 1991 ;  Parks  et al. , 2000 ;  Shane  et al. , 2004b ;  Standish  et al. , 2007 ;  Hawkins  et al. , 2008 ). Even a slight increase in the low P concentration that is common in their natural environment is enough to disturb their growth severely, and may cause death. However, whilst it is relatively common in P-impoverished landscapes, P sensitivity is by no means universal among species from P-impoverished habitats, and even some Proteaceae species are insensitive to elevated P supply, e.g.  Grevillea crithmifolia  ( Shane and Lambers, 2006 ). The physiological mechanism accounting for P toxicity in higher plants is a low capacity to down-regulate their P uptake ( Shane  et al. , 2004c ;  Shane and Lambers, 2006 ;  de Campos  et al. , 2013 ). A low capacity to down-regulate P uptake is associated with a high capacity to remobilize P from senescing leaves, and  vice versa  ( de Campos  et al. , 2013 ). Whether this association is based on a mechanistic link involving the regulation of P transporters has yet to be explored.  Phosphorus enters the plant as inorganic phosphate (P i ). Plants have both high-affinity and low-affinity mechanisms for the transport of P i  across the plasma membrane and into the cytosol against a steep electrochemical potential gradient ( Cogliatti and Clarkson, 1983 ;  Drew and Saker, 1984 ;  Drew  et al. , 1984 ). The high-affinity transport is facilitated by P i  transport proteins of the PHT1 family ( Muchhal  et al. , 1996 ). The proteins responsible for the low-affinity acquisition of P i  are unknown, but characterization mostly in heterologous systems suggests that they may also be PHT1 proteins ( Harrison  et al. , 2002 ;  Rae  et al. , 2003 ;  Ai  et al. , 2009 ;  Preuss  et al. , 2010 ). Caution, however, may be needed in drawing conclusions about P i  affinity determined in heterologous systems ( Nussaume  et al. , 2011 ). Once inside the cell, P i  is transported into various compartments by proteins of the PHT2, PHT3, and PHT4 families. It is widely accepted that P i  is moved through the plant body by a variety of PHT1 proteins. While all PHT1 proteins that have been examined are able to transport P i  into cells in normal physiological conditions, only some may be able to release P i  from cells, and then only in specific conditions, such as during senescence ( Preuss  et al. , 2010 ,  2011 ).  Every plant species that has been examined has multiple genes encoding high-affinity PHT1 proteins.  Arabidopsis  has nine  PHT1  genes, while there are 13  PHT1  genes in rice. The exact number of  PHT1  genes in the P-sensitive Australian  Hakea prostrata  (Proteaceae) is unknown, but it is not atypical compared with these model plants (R. Jost, A. B. Siddique, B. Mirfakhraei, R. Pontré, H. Lambers and P.M. Finnegan, unpublished observations). Each  PHT1  gene has its own specific expression pattern ( Karthikeyan  et al. , 2002 ;  Mudge  et al. , 2002 ;  Misson  et al. , 2004 ;  Xiao  et al. , 2006 ;  Morcuende  et al. , 2007 ;  Nussaume  et al. , 2011 ). Most  PHT1  genes are strongly expressed in roots, but are also expressed in other cell types, tissues, and organs, with overlapping expression patterns among the members of the family ( Nussaume  et al. , 2011 ). The four  PHT1  genes of  H. prostrata  that have been characterized so far appear to follow these general expression trends (R. Pontré, B. Mirfakhraei, R. Jost, H. Lambers and P. M. Finnegan, unpublished observations).  A hallmark of the expression of nearly all  PHT1  genes is that their transcript abundance is repressed when tissues are exposed to high P i  and quickly derepressed when tissues are deprived of P i  ( Karthikeyan  et al. , 2002 ;  Mudge  et al. , 2002 ;  Morcuende  et al. , 2007 ;  Nussaume  et al. , 2011 ). This response to P i  availability provides an attractive mechanistic hypothesis for the low capacity of some native Australian plants to down-regulate their P uptake ( Shane  et al. , 2004c ;  Shane and Lambers, 2006 ;  de Campos  et al. , 2013 ). It may be that specific  PHT1  genes are not repressed by a sudden influx of P i  or that P i  exerts a positive effect on  PHT1  expression. Alternatively, PHT1 proteins present on the plasma membrane of specific cell types may not be removed from the membrane efficiently when P i  becomes more available. A putative repressor of PHT1 function, acting either directly or indirectly via PHO1, is the E2 ubiquitin conjugase PHO2 ( Liu  et al. , 2012 ). Remarkably,  pho2  mutants in  Arabidopsis thaliana  display a higher P i  uptake capacity than wild-type plants, leading to hyper-accumulation of P i  in leaves, resembling P-toxicity symptoms described for Proteaceae species ( Dong  et al. , 1998 ). This raises the possibility that plants adapted to very low P availability may not need this rather expensive module governing the down-regulation of P i  uptake. The finding that PHO2 is still expressed in  H. prostrata  (R. Jost, P. M. Finnegan and H. Lambers, unpublished observations) does not necessarily contradict this statement, because PHO2 seems to have functions other than the repression of PHO1 and P i  transport (as well as PHT1 transporters;  Liu  et al. , 2012 ). Further research is needed to understand the relative contribution of these processes to P i  toxicity in P-sensitive plants.  Each  PHT1  gene may have a specific function. In  Arabidopsis , AtPHT1;1 and AtPHT1;4 are responsible for the bulk of P i  acquisition from the soil solution ( Misson  et al. , 2004 ;  Shin  et al. , 2004 ). Interestingly,  AtPHT1;4  transcript accumulation is not very responsive to changes in P i  availability ( Woo  et al. , 2012 ). This is also the case for rice  OsPHT1;1 , which is constitutively expressed in both root and shoot tissues. This transporter is responsible for the bulk of P i  uptake and translocation in rice during P-replete conditions and is still under the control of OsPHO2, but not OsPHR2 ( Sun  et al. , 2012 ). These findings indicate that there may be different regulatory pathways involved for inducible vs. bulk transport of P i . In Proteaceae species, a similar uncoupling of PHT1 expression from the P-starvation response mediated via the MYB transcription factor PHR1 could have taken place. Other transporters, such as AtPHT1;5, and perhaps the low-affinity barley HvPHT1;6, have an important role in the source-to-sink mobilization of P i  from senescing leaves ( Huang  et al. , 2011 ;  Nagarajan  et al. , 2011 ). Some  PHT1  genes are necessary for the rapid transport of P i  from the root to the shoot (H. Gaza, R. Jost and P. M. Finnegan, unpublished observations). In plants that form mycorrhizal associations, specific sets of  PHT1  genes are induced to transport P i  from the mycorrhizal partner to the plant ( Smith and Barker, 2002 ;  Javot  et al. , 2007 ;  Smith and Read, 2008 ;  Pumplin and Harrison, 2009 ;  Kobae and Hata, 2010 ;  Loth-Pereda  et al. , 2011 ). At the same time, other  PHT1  genes responsible for the acquisition of P i  from the bulk soil solution are repressed. This same response is observed during mycorrhization in the P-sensitive Australian  Eucalyptus marginata  (Myrtaceae; K. Kariman, R. Jost, S. J. Barker, P. M. Finnegan and M. Tibbett, unpublished ­observations).  Most species in Australia's biodiversity hotspot have the capacity to establish a mycorrhizal symbiosis ( Brundrett, 2009 ), but mycorrhizal species do not become dominant on the most severely P-impoverished soils ( Lambers  et al. , 2010 ). Their scavenging strategy allows them to acquire poorly mobile nutrients, such as P, that are at some distance from the root surface or in pores in the soil that are too small for root hairs to penetrate ( Smith and Read, 2008 ), provided P is readily available and not strongly sorbed ( Parfitt, 1979 ). Nevertheless, species that lack cluster roots or similar root specializations do co-occur with dominant Proteaceae ( Lambers  et al. , 2006 ,  2010 ), which do not form mycorrhizal associations ( Shane and Lambers, 2005a ). This may highlight the advantage for a plant to invest carbon to produce cluster roots, rather than investing carbon in an arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis in low-P soils. Furthermore, plants do not produce their roots in isolation, but rather interact with each other through them. However, the nature and outcome of this interaction for P uptake are unknown. The greater efficiencies in acquiring soil P by cluster-rooted Proteaceae could ultimately lead to a competitive exclusion of neighbouring mycorrhizal species. In addition, cluster-rooted Proteaceae may release a range of compounds that inhibit microbial activity and hence restrict mycorrhization, as found in  L. albus  (reviewed by  Lambers  et al. , 2013 ). However, as previously noted, total exclusion of mycorrhizal species does not occur on severely nutrient-impoverished soils, because many plant species co-occur without any obvious nutrient or growth deficiencies (Fig.  2 ).  While there are many possible explanations for why species of contrasting nutrient-acquisition strategies coexist in ancient, P-impoverished soils ( Laliberté  et al. , 2013 ), one of these is fitness equalization through resource sharing. For example, facilitation of P uptake has been demonstrated between agricultural cluster-rooted and AM species. Indeed, both P uptake and biomass are increased when wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) is intercropped with white lupin, due to the ability of the latter species to mobilize P with citric acid exuded by its cluster roots ( Horst and Waschkies, 1987 ;  Cu  et al. , 2005 ). Phosphorus uptake from soil is also increased in AM wheat intercropped with chickpea ( Cicer arietinum ) growing on organic sources of P, and this is attributed to the release of acid phosphatases by chickpea ( Li  et al. , 2004 ). With regard to plant species coexistence in south-western Australian P-impoverished soils, this raises the following question: is there a potential facilitation of P i  uptake between cluster roots and the roots of a neighbouring AM plant, through the release of carboxylates, ribonucleases, and/or phosphatases? If so, then facilitation by plants that release carboxylates, ribonucleases, and/or phosphatases may slow down competitive exclusion of mycorrhizal species. We note that such fitness equalization would act as an ‘equalizing mechanism’ ( sensu   Chesson, 2000 ), because it would not, by itself, be sufficient to lead to stable coexistence. However, other stabilizing mechanisms that reduce inter-specific over intra-specific competition ( sensu   Chesson, 2000 ), such as partitioning of soil P between species of different nutrient-acquisition strategies ( Turner, 2008 ;  Lambers  et al. , 2010 ), could also operate simultaneously and therefore lead to stable coexistence.  In pot experiments in a glasshouse study,  Muler  et al.  (2013)  found evidence for facilitation of the growth of ectomycorrhizal  Scholtzia involucrata  (Myrtaceae) by the cluster-rooted  Banksia attenuata  (Proteaceae). Interestingly, the positive effect of  B. attenuata  was not due to the mobilization of P, because addition of P did not enhance the growth of  S. involucrata . Rather, the results showed facilitation of  S. involucrata  when grown with the cluster-rooted  B. attenuata , due to enhanced acquisition of Mn and possibly other micronutrients. Leaf [Mn] of  S. involucrata  was increased in the presence of  B. attenuata , and this increased [Mn] was associated with enhanced growth. It has yet to be explored how common the facilitation by carboxylate-releasing species is on severely P-impoverished soils. For example, facilitation does not appear to occur when Proteaceae plants have high levels of P in their tissue, possibly because this suppresses cluster-root activity. In a split-root experiment in a glasshouse,  Wood (2011)  found no evidence for facilitation of P uptake in the AM species  S. involucrata  or  Hibbertia subvaginata  in the presence of cluster roots of  B. attenuata ; neither biomass nor tissue [P] were positively related to the biomass of the neighbouring  B. attenuata  cluster roots. This result may have been due to the fact that the seedlings used by  Wood (2011)  had high initial P concentrations, especially in  B. attenuata , with 1.2 ± 0.77 and 3.6 ± 0.77 mg g −1  dry weight in the young leaves and stems, respectively, i.e. 285% higher than plants growing in the wild ( Lambers  et al. , 2012 ).  What determines the fact that Proteaceae are more or less excluded from soils with higher P levels ( Lambers  et al. , 2010 )? One possibility is that they might suffer P toxicity on such soils, as evidenced by pot trials with native species from P-impoverished locations on Hawkesbury Sandstone soils near Sydney, Australia ( Thomson and Leishman, 2004 ). However, as not all Proteaceae are P sensitive ( Shane and Lambers, 2006 ;  Parks  et al. , 2007 ), this is unlikely to be the full explanation. Proteaceae in south-western Australia's biodiversity hotspot tend to have a very high leaf mass per unit leaf area ( Groom  et al. , 1997 ;  Lamont and Groom, 2002 ;  Denton  et al. , 2007 ;  Lambers  et al. , 2012 ), which tends to be associated with slow growth ( Lambers and Poorter, 1992 ). Therefore, their inherently slow growth rate may lead to competitive exclusion of Proteaceae from less infertile sites. In the early 1950s, P fertilizers, as well as nitrogen and micronutrients, were added in various combinations to raise the fertility of an area of native heath vegetation in southern Australia. There was no significant response to the application of nitrogen or micronutrients, but a significant response to the combined application of nitrogen and P after 10 years. Fertilization with P showed major effects, which, collectively, gradually changed the heath vegetation, which initially had a significant component of Proteaceae species, towards an herbaceous sward over 22 years ( Heddle and Specht, 1975 ). Below, we discuss how elevated soil P levels, for instance as a result of increased fire frequency, negatively impact most Proteaceae species.  Given that Proteaceae species rarely occupy habitats that are not severely P impoverished, it is envisaged that P enrichment has a negative impact on the performance of these species ( Heddle and Specht, 1975 ). Indeed, urban storm water run-off has a negative impact on the growth and survival of species naturally occurring on P-impoverished Hawkesbury Sandstone soils, including  Banksia ericifolia  ( Leishman  et al. , 2004 ;  Thomson and Leishman, 2004 ). Likewise, enrichment with P and other nutrients makes naturally P-impoverished habitats in urban bushland in Sydney, Australia, prone to invasion by exotic plants ( King and Buckney, 2002 ).  In Bold Park, an area of urban bushland in Perth, Western Australia, increased fire frequency has led to elevated soil P levels and an abundance of exotic plants at the expense of species naturally occurring in P-impoverished soils, especially Proteaceae ( Fisher  et al. , 2006 ,  2009 ). A comparison of species composition in another urban bushland area in Perth, Kings Park, also exposed to increased fire frequency and the associated elevation in soil P status, between 1939 and 1999, shows a decline in four species of  Banksia  (Proteaceae) and an increase in the ectomycorrhizal trees  Eucalyptus gomphocephala ,  E. marginata  and  Corymbia calophylla  (Myrtaceae;  Crosti  et al. , 2007 ). Interestingly, there was an increase in the abundance of  Banksia  (formerly  Dryandra )  sessilis , showing that not all Proteaceae respond in the same manner to increased fire frequency. Similar changes have not been observed in pristine areas where fire frequencies have not increased.  One source of P in nutrient-poor areas is fire suppressants. Whilst not all contain P, those that do significantly enhance soil P, with an effect that persists for at least 12 months ( Leach, 2013 ). In P-impoverished biodiverse areas, these P-containing fire suppressants should be avoided. Dust or run-off from roads, if they are constructed using nutrient-rich substrates, could also be a source of P, but this possibility has received very little attention.  In a study on the effects of water and nutrient incursion from agricultural land on adjoining native  Banksia  woodland in Western Australia,  Grigg  et al.  (2000)  found that numbers of species of native woody taxa and plant densities increased away from the agricultural area towards the pristine bushland. Total above- and below-ground biomass of woody species decreased away from the agricultural area, probably indicating a fertilization effect. Near the agricultural area, vegetation was appreciably depleted in leaf [Mn] compared with pristine bushland, suggesting that plants close to the boundary were relying less on carboxylate release for P acquisition. These data clearly show a negative impact of farming on nearby native bushland, with less P-sensitive species increasing in growth and more P-sensitive ones declining in abundance. Whilst the abundance of Proteaceae species in general was negatively impacted by incursion of nutrients and water from adjacent agricultural land, the abundance of  Banksia prionotes  increased ( Grigg  et al. , 2000 ). Interestingly, both  B. prionotes  and  B. sessilis , which we discussed above, are among very few Proteaceae species that inhabit the young and comparatively fertile coastal dunes ( Dixon, 2011 ) in south-western Australia, which are relatively nutrient rich in comparison to the much older and strongly weathered and acidic dunes on the Swan coastal plain and areas further inland ( Laliberté  et al. , 2012 ;  Lambers  et al. , 2012 ).  Changes in resin P (i.e. readily available P;  a ), percentage canopy cover of Proteaceae species ( b ), and species richness of Proteaceae ( c ) along five stages of the Jurien Bay 2 million year dune chronosequence in south-western Australia ( Laliberté  et al. , 2012 ). Data for (a) are from  Laliberté  et al.  (2012) , whereas data for (b) and (c) are from 50 10 m × 10 m plots (i.e. five chronosequence stages × 10 replicate plots) of a recent vegetation survey (G. Zemunik; unpublished data). Stages 1–3 represent Holocene (&lt;7000 years) dunes, whereas stages 4–5 represent Pleistocene dunes (&gt;120 000 years;  Laliberté  et al. , 2012 ).  Phosphite, phosphate, and organic phosphonate. ( a ) Phosphite is less oxidized than phosphate and is not a source of phosphorus for plants. In soil, phosphite is microbially oxidized to phosphate, which then becomes available for uptake by plant roots. ( b ) Fungicides such as Fosetyl-Al are organic phosphonates (characterized by a stable C–P bond) that releases phosphite upon hydrolysis.  Devastating effects of  P. cinnamomi  occur throughout Western Australia's biodiversity hotspot, including national parks that exhibit the greatest biodiversity in the region and significant metropolitan bushland areas. Photographs by Chris Dunne, Department of Conservation, Western Australia.  At this stage, phosphite is the only available chemical tool to combat the disease in natural systems in Australia ( Hardy  et al. , 2001 ;  Shearer and Fairman, 2007 ). It has been marketed for several decades as the active ingredient released after hydrolysis of organic phosphonates (Fig.  4 b;  Cohen and Coffey, 1986 ) in fungicides such as Aliette ®  (i.e. Fosetyl-Al, aluminium tris- O -ethyl phosphonate; BayerCrop Science) and effectively applied against plant diseases (downy mildews, and root and crown rots) in crops such as stone fruits, pineapples, and vegetables, as well as turf grasses and ornamentals. Phosphite can protect individual plants ( Hardy  et al. , 2001 ), but it does not stop disease progression in native vegetation ( Shearer  et al. , 2004b ,  2006 ;  Dunne  et al. , 2010 ). Phosphite does reduce mortality due to  P. cinnamomi  ( Pilbeam  et al. , 2000 ;  Wilkinson  et al. , 2001 ;  Barrett  et al. , 2003 ), and it can slow the rate of disease centre extension and reduce the rate of plant mortality ( Shearer  et al. , 2004b ). In the moderately resistant  Lambertia formosa  (Proteaceae) and the more susceptible  Lambertia inermis , phosphite-induced protection is associated with increased superoxide release 8 h after inoculation, and increased phenylalanine ammonia lyase activity 24 h after inoculation ( Suddaby  et al. , 2008 ). In  E. marginata  (Myrtaceae), the effect of phosphite in controlling the pathogen is probably determined by the phosphite concentration at the host–pathogen interface. When phosphite concentrations within the roots are low, it primes the tissue for a stronger and faster defence response upon pathogen infection ( Jackson  et al. , 2000 ). Phosphite induces the host's defence against  P. cinnamomi  as well as a wide range of other pathogens, ranging from oomycetes to fungi and nematodes ( Reuveni  et al. , 2003 ;  Aguín  et al. , 2006 ;  Oka  et al. , 2007 ;  Percival  et al. , 2009 ;  Lobato  et al. , 2010 ). Phosphite-induced resistance can protect treated plants for extended periods of months or even years before re-application becomes necessary ( Tynan  et al. , 2001 ;  Dunstan  et al. , 2010 ). High phosphite concentrations in the root tissue act directly on the pathogen to inhibit its growth before it can establish an association with the host, and the host defences remain unchanged ( Jackson  et al. , 2000 ).  Although the term ‘fungicide’ is often used to describe the direct effect of phosphite on oomycete pathogens, it is in fact a biostat, because phosphite does not kill the pathogen, but only slows its growth. This is mainly explained by its impact on metabolism, most probably impairing phosphate homeostasis and metabolic reactions, at least partly through mimicking phosphate while not being metabolized ( Griffith  et al. , 1990 ;  Barchietto  et al. , 1992 ;  Niere  et al. , 1994 ). Despite the wide and successful use of phosphite to prevent the spread of  P. cinnamomi , our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effect of induced resistance in the plant is scant. Studies in the model plant  Arabidopsis thaliana  have enabled the mode of phosphite action to be analysed at the molecular level. The plant hormone salicylic acid, a well-known signalling molecule in defence responses, and the transcription co-activator NPR1 (non-expressor of PR1), involved in the salicylic acid-dependent signalling pathway, are important components in the mechanisms leading to increased resistance after phosphite application. Mutant plants impaired in the accumulation of salicylic acid or its signalling cascade show reduced phosphite-induced resistance against the oomycete pathogen  Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis  ( Molina  et al. , 1998 ;  Friedrich  et al. , 2001 ). Moreover, phosphite application can lead to a stronger and faster defence response in  A. thaliana  subsequently inoculated with  H. arabidopsidis  ( Massoud  et al. , 2012 ). This response involves the proteins EDS1 (enhanced disease susceptibility 1) and PAD4 (phytoalexin deficient 4), which are upstream of salicylic acid, and the mitogen activated protein kinase MPK4. This augmented activation of resistance mechanisms by pre-treatment with low levels of the inducing chemical, often leading to local and systemic immunity, has been known for a long time and termed ‘defence priming’ ( Conrath  et al. , 2006 ). Interestingly, this acquired primed state can be passed on to the offspring by epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation ( Luna  et al. , 2012 ;  Rasmann  et al. , 2012 ;  Slaughter  et al. , 2012 ). This transgenerational induced resistance has the potential for an inheritable adaptation to pathogen pressure and might also explain the long-lasting effect of phosphite applications if similar epigenetic modifications are induced. Thus, understanding of the molecular mechanism of phosphite action has great potential. Current ‘omics technologies (i.e. genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) allow determination of phosphite-induced changes in gene expression, and protein and metabolite abundances. Their application will allow a detailed description of the impact of phosphite on a whole-systems scale, and will help in the identification of key targets of phosphite, thus creating a knowledge base for the targeted development of alternative compounds. Although this type of approach is especially applicable to plant model species, such as  A. thaliana , because of a highly developed genetic and molecular tool kit, similar approaches and translational knowledge transfer become increasingly applicable for non-model organisms ( Lambers  et al. , 2012 ).  As discussed above, phosphite is oxidized to phosphate by soil microbes, potentially shifting the balance between highly P-efficient, non-mycorrhizal species and less P-efficient ones. Finding an alternative to phosphite would prevent the indirect increase of P availability in native ecosystems. The need for such alternatives is also apparent from reports of oomycete pathogens developing resistance to phosphite, as has been observed for lettuce downy mildew ( Brown  et al. , 2004 ). Chemicals with similar defence-inducing properties, such as the salicylic acid analogue benzo-( 1 , 2 , 3 )-thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid and the non-proteinogenic amino acid β-aminobutyric acid are available, and their efficacy has been studied ( Conrath, 2009 ). So far, large-scale application, similar to phosphite, has not been successful, not even in agricultural systems that are easier to manage. Nevertheless, knowledge gained concerning these compounds will also improve our understanding of the mode of phosphite action and the identification of practical alternative compounds.

The plants were located within quadrats (numbered 1–8; see Fig. 6b), growing naturally (–Phi), treated with phosphite (+Phi), infested with  P. cinnamomi  and not treated (+ Pc  –Phi), or infested and treated with phosphite (+ Pc  +Phi;  n  = 3). Error bars indicate SEM ( n  = 4); columns not sharing the same letter indicate significant differences between treatments within species according to Tukey's test ( P  = 0.05); ns, no significant difference. Different columns with the same colour refer to different quadrats (Fig. 6b) for the same treatment; three trees within each quadrat were sampled, and four leaves per plant were used. Missing bars are due to the fact that trees had succumbed to the pathogen before sampling had commenced.  With the exact molecular mode of phosphite action being unknown, it is important also to consider its impact on P-signalling networks in plants ( Ticconi  et al. , 2001 ;  Varadarajan  et al. , 2002 ). Disturbances in nutrient ­homeostasis have recently been shown to impact directly on ­­plant–pathogen interactions ( Pannell and Ewing, 2006 ;  Van Damme  et al. , 2009 ;  Stuttmann  et al. , 2011 ;  lvarez  et al. , 2012 ;  Kruse  et al. , 2012 ). Therefore, phosphite may interact with P i -signalling components that could trigger the suggested priming of defence responses. Phosphate-signalling networks can include both local and systemic signalling pathways, and it has been assumed that local responses are triggered upon the recognition of P i  itself, while systemic responses may be triggered by changes in hormone levels or in a yet to be identified organic phosphate ester pool ( Liu  et al. , 2010 ;  Thibaud  et al. , 2010 ;  Chiou and Lin, 2011 ;  Nagarajan and Smith, 2012 ). Given that phosphite cannot be metabolized by plants, it has been assumed only to interfere with the local sensing of P i  itself; therefore, it has long been considered an excellent tool to distinguish between different sensors ( McDonald  et al. , 2001 ;  Ticconi  et al. , 2004 ). Unfortunately, P i  is a strong inhibitor of methylphosphonate (an organic analogue of phosphite) transport with an apparent  K  i  of 5 µM ( Pratt  et al. , 2009 ). Phosphite and methylphosphonate also show different accumulation patterns in subcellular compartments compared with P i  and are influenced by the presence of P i  according to detailed nuclear magnetic resonance studies using cell culture systems ( Danova-Alt  et al. , 2008 ;  Pratt  et al. , 2009 ). These findings suggest that any observed effects of phosphite need to be interpreted with caution. They also suggest that the P status of the plant is critically important for phosphite acquisition and allocation, and may explain the varying degree of success of plant protection in the field. Starving plants of P i  before the application of phosphite to circumvent some of these issues has been considered by Varadarajan and co-workers (2002); however, the strong overall growth inhibitory effects of phosphite on P-starved plants ( Thao and Yamakawa, 2009 ) make it necessary to focus on short-term effects on P i -signalling networks, and carefully monitor its tissue accumulation patterns to distinguish clearly between primary and secondary effects. This growth inhibition could also cause species loss in severely P-impoverished landscapes. At this time, it is also unclear whether different PHT transporters have different affinities for phosphite. As a first step, these kinetic properties would need to be determined and compared with the kinetics of P i  uptake in electrophysiological studies, as well as knock-out lines for individual transporters in  Arabidopsis  or other model plant species. As it is not clear whether any of the known PHT transporters also acts as a tranceptor that signals the availability of P i , similar to the nitrate-sensing properties of the AtNTR1;1 transporter ( Gojon  et al. , 2011 ), phosphite could directly interfere with this transceptor function, perturbing down-stream signalling pathways. Another possibility is that phosphite interferes with protein kinase/phosphatase regulatory units that control the phosphorylation status of PHT proteins, thereby regulating their incorporation into the plasma membrane (or their activity;  Bayle  et al. , 2011 ).  Phosphite competitively inhibits phosphate uptake by cluster roots in  Hakea sericea  ( Sousa  et al. , 2007 ). It also ­triggers cluster-root development alongside other P-starvation responses in P-sufficient white lupin ( Gilbert  et al. , 2000 ). Given the above-mentioned observations in model plant species, phosphite has the potential to suppress cluster-root development in P-limited Proteaceae and other cluster-root producing plant species. Thus, there could be direct implications for the phosphate-mining strategy of native Proteaceae species upon long-term exposure to phosphite. The exact time frame over which these changes might occur is unknown, and detailed monitoring of treated flora and plant communities is therefore recommended. Given that phosphite has been used for only 15 years, the tipping point may not yet have been reached.  Mean Shannon-diversity ( a ) and evenness ( b ) for four ‘treatments’ (plus or minus  P. cinnamomi  and/or long-term phosphite spraying) at Gull Rock National Park, near Albany in Western Australia. The bars represent the SEM;  n  = 40. Mean Shannon-diversity index was significantly different between the four treatments ( F ( 3 , 36 ) = 5.734,  P  = 0.003), as was the mean evenness ( F ( 3 ,  36 ) = 8.111,  P  &lt; 0.0001).  Given that the greatest plant diversity in south-western Australia occurs on its most severely P-impoverished soils, P enrichment of natural habitats is a major threat to biodiversity of this globally significant biodiversity hotspot. We surmise that this threat is very similar for other P-impoverished environments, including the fynbos in South Africa ( Cowling  et al. , 1996 ;  Richards  et al. , 1997 ;  Linder, 2005 ) and the cerrado in Brazil ( Eiten, 1972 ;  Ratter  et al. , 1997 ;  Lannes  et al. , 2012 ). To conserve the biodiversity of such habitats requires maintenance of low soil fertility, in particular a low soil P status ( Heddle and Specht, 1975 ;  Adam, 2012 ). Minimizing the impact of run-off, P-containing fire suppressants, and pesticides, and maintaining a low fire frequency are therefore essential (Table  1 ). In old, climatically buffered, infertile landscapes, P is the key nutrient that provides a threat to plant biodiversity, rather than nitrogen, which tends to be a key limiting factor in younger landscapes ( Hopper, 2009 ;  Lambers  et al. , 2010 ). Once these systems have been eutrophied, it is extremely difficult to restore their former glory ( Standish  et al. , 2008 ;  Standish and Hobbs, 2010 ).  Whilst  P. cinnamomi  is a major threat to Australia's biodiversity, combating it by using phosphite cannot be a viable long-term solution, because P enrichment of severely P-impoverished soils replaces one threat by another (Table  1 ). In the short term, in the absence of any alternative, phosphite applications are essential. However, what is urgently required is a much better understanding of how phosphite functions, so that we can work towards alternatives for phosphite to achieve the same immunizing effects that phosphite induces in plants in response to oomycete pathogens. Once we know which metabolites are affected by phosphite, we can target the metabolic pathways with which phosphite interacts. Based on that knowledge, we can screen alternative, non-P-containing compounds for their ability to induce the same defence mechanisms, and thus attempt to induce the same anti- Phytophthora  effects as phosphite.
