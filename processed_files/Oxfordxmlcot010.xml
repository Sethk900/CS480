Threats include eutrophication due to phosphorus enrichment, due to increased fire frequency and spraying with phosphite to reduce the impacts of the introduced pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi. We propose a strategy to work towards alternatives to phosphite for pathogen management.South-western Australia harbours a global biodiversity hotspot on the world's most phosphorus (P)-impoverished soils. The greatest biodiversity occurs on the most severely nutrient-impoverished soils, where non-mycorrhizal species are a prominent component of the flora. Mycorrhizal species dominate where soils contain slightly more phosphorus. In addition to habitat loss and dryland salinity, a major threat to plant biodiversity in this region is eutrophication due to enrichment with P. Many plant species in the south-western Australian biodiversity hotspot are extremely sensitive to P, due to a low capability to down-regulate their phosphate-uptake capacity. Species from the most P-impoverished soils are also very poor competitors at higher P availability, giving way to more competitive species when soil P concentrations are increased. Sources of increased soil P concentrations include increased fire frequency, run-off from agricultural land, and urban activities. Another P source is the P-fertilizing effect of spraying natural environments on a landscape scale with phosphite to reduce the impacts of the introduced plant pathogen <italic>Phytophthora cinnamomi</italic>, which itself is a serious threat to biodiversity. We argue that alternatives to phosphite for <italic>P. cinnamomi</italic> management are needed urgently, and propose a strategy to work towards such alternatives, based on a sound understanding of the physiological and molecular mechanisms of the action of phosphite in plants that are susceptible to <italic>P. cinnamomi</italic>. The threats we describe for the south-western Australian biodiversity hotspot are likely to be very similar for other P-impoverished environments, including the fynbos in South Africa and the cerrado in Brazil.Plants and plant communities in south-western Australia's global biodiversity hotspot.

Photographs by Marion Cambridge and Hans Lambers.Plant diversity and soil phosphorus (P) status in south-western Australia's global biodiversity hotspot. Note the relative abundance of non-mycorrhizal species on soils with the lowest phosphorus content. Modified after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C86">Lambers <italic>et al.</italic> (2010)</xref>.Two major threatening processes affect the biodiversity in the south-western Australian biodiversity hotspot and similar severely P-impoverished regions elsewhere in the worldSeveral factors can lead to eutrophication, some of which are discussed in detail. Physiological studies allow a better understanding of plant responses to threatening processes. These should ultimately guide management options with conservation outcomes. The physiological studies that are listed are discussed in the main text.A plant family that is richly represented on severely P-impoverished soils in south-western Australia and similar landscapes in South Africa is the Proteaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C28">Cowling and Lamont, 1998</xref>). Proteaceae species occur as major ecosystem components, often as keystone species. They are evergreen woody plants, ranging in size from prostrate shrubs to trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C16">Cavanagh and Pieroni, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C23">Collins <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). After fires, Proteaceae species regenerate either by sprouting epicormic shoots or by releasing seed from woody follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C92">Lamont and Markey, 1995</xref>). Proteaceae species contribute prominently to ecosystem functioning, such as fixation of carbon, provision of an architectural structure or habitat, and sharing and recycling of resources to minimize net nutrient loss, especially, from the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C162">Shearer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C163">2012</xref>). Flowers provide food for birds, mammals, and insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C66">Hopper, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C190">Whelan and Burbidge, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C80">Ladd <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C16">Cavanagh and Pieroni, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C24">Collins, 2008</xref>).Most of the species in the Proteaceae family produce proteoid roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C137">Purnell, 1960</xref>) and almost all of them are non-mycorrhizal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C152">Shane and Lambers, 2005a</xref>). An exception is the cluster-rooted mycorrhizal species <italic>Hakea verrucosa</italic>, which grows on ultramafic rocks that are rich in nickel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C12">Boulet and Lambers, 2005</xref>). The release of carboxylic acids from its cluster roots would increase the solubility of nickel and harm the plants; in addition, mycorrhizal associations may protect plants to some degree against metal toxicity (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C147">Schutzendubel and Polle, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C19">Christophersen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Proteoid roots are dense clusters of rootlets of determinate growth, which develop numerous root hairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C94">Lamont, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C152">Shane and Lambers, 2005a</xref>). Given that proteoid roots are not restricted to Proteaceae, the term ‘cluster roots’ is commonly used as an alternative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C152">Shane and Lambers, 2005a</xref>). Cluster roots release vast amounts of carboxylates in an exudative burst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C188">Watt and Evans, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C149">Shane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004a</xref>); the carboxylates mobilize P that is sorbed onto soil particles, making it available for uptake by plant roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C84">Lambers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Therefore, cluster roots effectively mine P that is unavailable for plants lacking this strategy. Outside the Proteaceae, cluster roots in Australia are found in Casuarinaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C142">Reddell <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>), Fabaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C90">Lamont, 1972</xref>), and Restionaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C84">Lambers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Cluster-root formation is suppressed in the presence of a high P supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C188">Watt and Evans, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C152">Shane and Lambers, 2005a</xref>), highlighting their important role for P uptake.Dauciform (i.e. carrot-shaped) roots occur in some tribes of the non-mycorrhizal family Cyperaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C32">Davies <italic>et al.</italic>, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C89">Lamont, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C156">Shane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006b</xref>), another common family on nutrient-impoverished soils. Dauciform roots were probably first recognized for <italic>Schoenus ferrugineus</italic> (Cyperaceae) by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C143">Renner (1935)</xref>, who thought they were a mycorrhizal structure (Pilzwurzel). Thereafter, they were described by Russian researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C148">Selivanov and Utemova, 1969</xref>). Dauciform roots are morphologically very different from cluster roots, but functionally quite similar; they also release vast amounts of carboxylates in an exudative burst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C132">Playsted <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C155">Shane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006a</xref>), and are suppressed in the presence of a high P supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C155">Shane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006a</xref>).Large amounts of carboxylates can also be exuded in the absence of specialized structures such as cluster roots and dauciform roots, e.g. in a range of <italic>Kennedia</italic> species (Fabaceae) from south-western Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C146">Ryan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). These species without cluster roots differ vastly in the amount of carboxylates they release, but what they have in common is that their carboxylate exudation is reduced in the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, which colonize the roots of some <italic>Kennedia</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C146">Ryan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). This suggests a trade-off in plant carbon allocation for P acquisition to either mycorrhizal fungi or carboxylate release.Manganese (Mn) accumulation is common in Proteaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C73">Jaffré, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C153">Shane and Lambers, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C138">Rabier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C44">Fernando <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), as well as in Fabaceae with cluster roots, e.g. <italic>Lupinus albus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C50">Gardner <italic>et al.</italic>, 1982</xref>) and <italic>Aspalathus lineari</italic>s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C113">Morton, 1983</xref>). This is explained by the ability of their cluster roots to mobilize Mn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C49">Gardner <italic>et al.</italic>, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C53">Grierson and Attiwill, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C36">Dinkelaker <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). Leaf [Mn] might therefore provide an indication of the extent to which roots depend on carboxylate release to acquire P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C153">Shane and Lambers, 2005b</xref>). Following this reasoning, we found that cluster-rooted Proteaceae and dauciform-rooted Cyperaceae along a 2 million year chronosequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C81">Laliberté <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) have higher leaf [Mn] than their neighbours without any of the carboxylate-releasing strategies discussed above, regardless of soil age and P status (P. Hayes, E. Laliberté and H. Lambers, unpublished observations). We also found the same phenomena in non-mycorrhizal species that produce sand-binding roots. It is therefore likely that the functional significance of sand-binding roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C157">Shane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C166">Smith <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) within an ecosystem is also, at least partly, that of mobilizing P through carboxylate release, but this requires further research.The high abundance of Proteaceae in severely P-impoverished landscapes is not accounted for exclusively by their very efficient P-acquisition strategy. In addition, at least three other traits determine their P efficiency. First, their P-use efficiency in photosynthesis is amongst the highest ever recorded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C195">Wright <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C35">Denton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), which is partly accounted for by extensive replacement of phospholipids by lipids that do not contain P during leaf development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C87">Lambers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). However, the decline in leaf P concentration during leaf development must also involve other metabolic changes, because the replacement of phospholipids is too small to explain the decrease entirely. Second, their long-lived leaves are very efficient and proficient at remobilizing P during leaf senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C35">Denton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), which greatly increases the mean residence time of P within the plant. Third, their seeds, unlike their vegetative tissues, contain very high concentrations of P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C35">Denton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C58">Groom and Lamont, 2010</xref>), allowing seedlings to grow without an external P source for a prolonged period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C108">Milberg and Lamont, 1997</xref>).Whilst Proteaceae and several other species that are endemic to south-western Australia and similar P-impoverished landscapes are very good at acquiring P and using it efficiently, many are extremely sensitive to P and readily display P-toxicity symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C60">Handreck, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C128">Parks <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C150">Shane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C170">Standish <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C63">Hawkins <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Even a slight increase in the low P concentration that is common in their natural environment is enough to disturb their growth severely, and may cause death. However, whilst it is relatively common in P-impoverished landscapes, P sensitivity is by no means universal among species from P-impoverished habitats, and even some Proteaceae species are insensitive to elevated P supply, e.g. <italic>Grevillea crithmifolia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C154">Shane and Lambers, 2006</xref>). The physiological mechanism accounting for P toxicity in higher plants is a low capacity to down-regulate their P uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C151">Shane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C154">Shane and Lambers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C34">de Campos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). A low capacity to down-regulate P uptake is associated with a high capacity to remobilize P from senescing leaves, and <italic>vice versa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C34">de Campos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Whether this association is based on a mechanistic link involving the regulation of P transporters has yet to be explored.Phosphorus enters the plant as inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>). Plants have both high-affinity and low-affinity mechanisms for the transport of P<sub>i</sub> across the plasma membrane and into the cytosol against a steep electrochemical potential gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C21">Cogliatti and Clarkson, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C39">Drew and Saker, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C40">Drew <italic>et al.</italic>, 1984</xref>). The high-affinity transport is facilitated by P<sub>i</sub> transport proteins of the PHT1 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C114">Muchhal <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). The proteins responsible for the low-affinity acquisition of P<sub>i</sub> are unknown, but characterization mostly in heterologous systems suggests that they may also be PHT1 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C62">Harrison <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C139">Rae <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C4">Ai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C134">Preuss <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Caution, however, may be needed in drawing conclusions about P<sub>i</sub> affinity determined in heterologous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C122">Nussaume <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Once inside the cell, P<sub>i</sub> is transported into various compartments by proteins of the PHT2, PHT3, and PHT4 families. It is widely accepted that P<sub>i</sub> is moved through the plant body by a variety of PHT1 proteins. While all PHT1 proteins that have been examined are able to transport P<sub>i</sub> into cells in normal physiological conditions, only some may be able to release P<sub>i</sub> from cells, and then only in specific conditions, such as during senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C134">Preuss <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C135">2011</xref>).Every plant species that has been examined has multiple genes encoding high-affinity PHT1 proteins. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has nine <italic>PHT1</italic> genes, while there are 13 <italic>PHT1</italic> genes in rice. The exact number of <italic>PHT1</italic> genes in the P-sensitive Australian <italic>Hakea prostrata</italic> (Proteaceae) is unknown, but it is not atypical compared with these model plants (R. Jost, A. B. Siddique, B. Mirfakhraei, R. Pontré, H. Lambers and P.M. Finnegan, unpublished observations). Each <italic>PHT1</italic> gene has its own specific expression pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C75">Karthikeyan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C115">Mudge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C110">Misson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C196">Xiao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C112">Morcuende <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C122">Nussaume <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Most <italic>PHT1</italic> genes are strongly expressed in roots, but are also expressed in other cell types, tissues, and organs, with overlapping expression patterns among the members of the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C122">Nussaume <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The four <italic>PHT1</italic> genes of <italic>H. prostrata</italic> that have been characterized so far appear to follow these general expression trends (R. Pontré, B. Mirfakhraei, R. Jost, H. Lambers and P. M. Finnegan, unpublished observations).A hallmark of the expression of nearly all <italic>PHT1</italic> genes is that their transcript abundance is repressed when tissues are exposed to high P<sub>i</sub> and quickly derepressed when tissues are deprived of P<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C75">Karthikeyan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C115">Mudge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C112">Morcuende <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C122">Nussaume <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). This response to P<sub>i</sub> availability provides an attractive mechanistic hypothesis for the low capacity of some native Australian plants to down-regulate their P uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C151">Shane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C154">Shane and Lambers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C34">de Campos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). It may be that specific <italic>PHT1</italic> genes are not repressed by a sudden influx of P<sub>i</sub> or that P<sub>i</sub> exerts a positive effect on <italic>PHT1</italic> expression. Alternatively, PHT1 proteins present on the plasma membrane of specific cell types may not be removed from the membrane efficiently when P<sub>i</sub> becomes more available. A putative repressor of PHT1 function, acting either directly or indirectly via PHO1, is the E2 ubiquitin conjugase PHO2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C102">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Remarkably, <italic>pho2</italic> mutants in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> display a higher P<sub>i</sub> uptake capacity than wild-type plants, leading to hyper-accumulation of P<sub>i</sub> in leaves, resembling P-toxicity symptoms described for Proteaceae species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C38">Dong <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). This raises the possibility that plants adapted to very low P availability may not need this rather expensive module governing the down-regulation of P<sub>i</sub> uptake. The finding that PHO2 is still expressed in <italic>H. prostrata</italic> (R. Jost, P. M. Finnegan and H. Lambers, unpublished observations) does not necessarily contradict this statement, because PHO2 seems to have functions other than the repression of PHO1 and P<sub>i</sub> transport (as well as PHT1 transporters; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C102">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Further research is needed to understand the relative contribution of these processes to P<sub>i</sub> toxicity in P-sensitive plants.Each <italic>PHT1</italic> gene may have a specific function. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, AtPHT1;1 and AtPHT1;4 are responsible for the bulk of P<sub>i</sub> acquisition from the soil solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C110">Misson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C164">Shin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>AtPHT1;4</italic> transcript accumulation is not very responsive to changes in P<sub>i</sub> availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C193">Woo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). This is also the case for rice <italic>OsPHT1;1</italic>, which is constitutively expressed in both root and shoot tissues. This transporter is responsible for the bulk of P<sub>i</sub> uptake and translocation in rice during P-replete conditions and is still under the control of OsPHO2, but not OsPHR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C175">Sun <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). These findings indicate that there may be different regulatory pathways involved for inducible vs. bulk transport of P<sub>i</sub>. In Proteaceae species, a similar uncoupling of PHT1 expression from the P-starvation response mediated via the MYB transcription factor PHR1 could have taken place. Other transporters, such as AtPHT1;5, and perhaps the low-affinity barley HvPHT1;6, have an important role in the source-to-sink mobilization of P<sub>i</sub> from senescing leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C70">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C119">Nagarajan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Some <italic>PHT1</italic> genes are necessary for the rapid transport of P<sub>i</sub> from the root to the shoot (H. Gaza, R. Jost and P. M. Finnegan, unpublished observations). In plants that form mycorrhizal associations, specific sets of <italic>PHT1</italic> genes are induced to transport P<sub>i</sub> from the mycorrhizal partner to the plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C167">Smith and Barker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C74">Javot <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C168">Smith and Read, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C136">Pumplin and Harrison, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C78">Kobae and Hata, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C104">Loth-Pereda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). At the same time, other <italic>PHT1</italic> genes responsible for the acquisition of P<sub>i</sub> from the bulk soil solution are repressed. This same response is observed during mycorrhization in the P-sensitive Australian <italic>Eucalyptus marginata</italic> (Myrtaceae; K. Kariman, R. Jost, S. J. Barker, P. M. Finnegan and M. Tibbett, unpublished ­observations).Most species in Australia's biodiversity hotspot have the capacity to establish a mycorrhizal symbiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C14">Brundrett, 2009</xref>), but mycorrhizal species do not become dominant on the most severely P-impoverished soils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C86">Lambers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Their scavenging strategy allows them to acquire poorly mobile nutrients, such as P, that are at some distance from the root surface or in pores in the soil that are too small for root hairs to penetrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C168">Smith and Read, 2008</xref>), provided P is readily available and not strongly sorbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C127">Parfitt, 1979</xref>). Nevertheless, species that lack cluster roots or similar root specializations do co-occur with dominant Proteaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C84">Lambers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C86">2010</xref>), which do not form mycorrhizal associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C152">Shane and Lambers, 2005a</xref>). This may highlight the advantage for a plant to invest carbon to produce cluster roots, rather than investing carbon in an arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis in low-P soils. Furthermore, plants do not produce their roots in isolation, but rather interact with each other through them. However, the nature and outcome of this interaction for P uptake are unknown. The greater efficiencies in acquiring soil P by cluster-rooted Proteaceae could ultimately lead to a competitive exclusion of neighbouring mycorrhizal species. In addition, cluster-rooted Proteaceae may release a range of compounds that inhibit microbial activity and hence restrict mycorrhization, as found in <italic>L. albus</italic> (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C88">Lambers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). However, as previously noted, total exclusion of mycorrhizal species does not occur on severely nutrient-impoverished soils, because many plant species co-occur without any obvious nutrient or growth deficiencies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COT010F2">2</xref>).While there are many possible explanations for why species of contrasting nutrient-acquisition strategies coexist in ancient, P-impoverished soils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C82">Laliberté <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), one of these is fitness equalization through resource sharing. For example, facilitation of P uptake has been demonstrated between agricultural cluster-rooted and AM species. Indeed, both P uptake and biomass are increased when wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) is intercropped with white lupin, due to the ability of the latter species to mobilize P with citric acid exuded by its cluster roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C69">Horst and Waschkies, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C30">Cu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Phosphorus uptake from soil is also increased in AM wheat intercropped with chickpea (<italic>Cicer arietinum</italic>) growing on organic sources of P, and this is attributed to the release of acid phosphatases by chickpea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C99">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). With regard to plant species coexistence in south-western Australian P-impoverished soils, this raises the following question: is there a potential facilitation of P<sub>i</sub> uptake between cluster roots and the roots of a neighbouring AM plant, through the release of carboxylates, ribonucleases, and/or phosphatases? If so, then facilitation by plants that release carboxylates, ribonucleases, and/or phosphatases may slow down competitive exclusion of mycorrhizal species. We note that such fitness equalization would act as an ‘equalizing mechanism’ (<italic>sensu</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C17">Chesson, 2000</xref>), because it would not, by itself, be sufficient to lead to stable coexistence. However, other stabilizing mechanisms that reduce inter-specific over intra-specific competition (<italic>sensu</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C17">Chesson, 2000</xref>), such as partitioning of soil P between species of different nutrient-acquisition strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C181">Turner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C86">Lambers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), could also operate simultaneously and therefore lead to stable coexistence.In pot experiments in a glasshouse study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C116">Muler <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref> found evidence for facilitation of the growth of ectomycorrhizal <italic>Scholtzia involucrata</italic> (Myrtaceae) by the cluster-rooted <italic>Banksia attenuata</italic> (Proteaceae). Interestingly, the positive effect of <italic>B. attenuata</italic> was not due to the mobilization of P, because addition of P did not enhance the growth of <italic>S. involucrata</italic>. Rather, the results showed facilitation of <italic>S. involucrata</italic> when grown with the cluster-rooted <italic>B. attenuata</italic>, due to enhanced acquisition of Mn and possibly other micronutrients. Leaf [Mn] of <italic>S. involucrata</italic> was increased in the presence of <italic>B. attenuata</italic>, and this increased [Mn] was associated with enhanced growth. It has yet to be explored how common the facilitation by carboxylate-releasing species is on severely P-impoverished soils. For example, facilitation does not appear to occur when Proteaceae plants have high levels of P in their tissue, possibly because this suppresses cluster-root activity. In a split-root experiment in a glasshouse, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C194">Wood (2011)</xref> found no evidence for facilitation of P uptake in the AM species <italic>S. involucrata</italic> or <italic>Hibbertia subvaginata</italic> in the presence of cluster roots of <italic>B. attenuata</italic>; neither biomass nor tissue [P] were positively related to the biomass of the neighbouring <italic>B. attenuata</italic> cluster roots. This result may have been due to the fact that the seedlings used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C194">Wood (2011)</xref> had high initial P concentrations, especially in <italic>B. attenuata</italic>, with 1.2 ± 0.77 and 3.6 ± 0.77 mg g<sup>−1</sup> dry weight in the young leaves and stems, respectively, i.e. 285% higher than plants growing in the wild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C87">Lambers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).What determines the fact that Proteaceae are more or less excluded from soils with higher P levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C86">Lambers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>)? One possibility is that they might suffer P toxicity on such soils, as evidenced by pot trials with native species from P-impoverished locations on Hawkesbury Sandstone soils near Sydney, Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C178">Thomson and Leishman, 2004</xref>). However, as not all Proteaceae are P sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C154">Shane and Lambers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C129">Parks <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), this is unlikely to be the full explanation. Proteaceae in south-western Australia's biodiversity hotspot tend to have a very high leaf mass per unit leaf area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C57">Groom <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C93">Lamont and Groom, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C35">Denton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C87">Lambers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), which tends to be associated with slow growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C83">Lambers and Poorter, 1992</xref>). Therefore, their inherently slow growth rate may lead to competitive exclusion of Proteaceae from less infertile sites. In the early 1950s, P fertilizers, as well as nitrogen and micronutrients, were added in various combinations to raise the fertility of an area of native heath vegetation in southern Australia. There was no significant response to the application of nitrogen or micronutrients, but a significant response to the combined application of nitrogen and P after 10 years. Fertilization with P showed major effects, which, collectively, gradually changed the heath vegetation, which initially had a significant component of Proteaceae species, towards an herbaceous sward over 22 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C64">Heddle and Specht, 1975</xref>). Below, we discuss how elevated soil P levels, for instance as a result of increased fire frequency, negatively impact most Proteaceae species.Given that Proteaceae species rarely occupy habitats that are not severely P impoverished, it is envisaged that P enrichment has a negative impact on the performance of these species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C64">Heddle and Specht, 1975</xref>). Indeed, urban storm water run-off has a negative impact on the growth and survival of species naturally occurring on P-impoverished Hawkesbury Sandstone soils, including <italic>Banksia ericifolia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C98">Leishman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C178">Thomson and Leishman, 2004</xref>). Likewise, enrichment with P and other nutrients makes naturally P-impoverished habitats in urban bushland in Sydney, Australia, prone to invasion by exotic plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C77">King and Buckney, 2002</xref>).In Bold Park, an area of urban bushland in Perth, Western Australia, increased fire frequency has led to elevated soil P levels and an abundance of exotic plants at the expense of species naturally occurring in P-impoverished soils, especially Proteaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C45">Fisher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C46">2009</xref>). A comparison of species composition in another urban bushland area in Perth, Kings Park, also exposed to increased fire frequency and the associated elevation in soil P status, between 1939 and 1999, shows a decline in four species of <italic>Banksia</italic> (Proteaceae) and an increase in the ectomycorrhizal trees <italic>Eucalyptus gomphocephala</italic>, <italic>E. marginata</italic> and <italic>Corymbia calophylla</italic> (Myrtaceae; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C29">Crosti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Interestingly, there was an increase in the abundance of <italic>Banksia</italic> (formerly <italic>Dryandra</italic>) <italic>sessilis</italic>, showing that not all Proteaceae respond in the same manner to increased fire frequency. Similar changes have not been observed in pristine areas where fire frequencies have not increased.One source of P in nutrient-poor areas is fire suppressants. Whilst not all contain P, those that do significantly enhance soil P, with an effect that persists for at least 12 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C96">Leach, 2013</xref>). In P-impoverished biodiverse areas, these P-containing fire suppressants should be avoided. Dust or run-off from roads, if they are constructed using nutrient-rich substrates, could also be a source of P, but this possibility has received very little attention.In a study on the effects of water and nutrient incursion from agricultural land on adjoining native <italic>Banksia</italic> woodland in Western Australia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C55">Grigg <italic>et al.</italic> (2000)</xref> found that numbers of species of native woody taxa and plant densities increased away from the agricultural area towards the pristine bushland. Total above- and below-ground biomass of woody species decreased away from the agricultural area, probably indicating a fertilization effect. Near the agricultural area, vegetation was appreciably depleted in leaf [Mn] compared with pristine bushland, suggesting that plants close to the boundary were relying less on carboxylate release for P acquisition. These data clearly show a negative impact of farming on nearby native bushland, with less P-sensitive species increasing in growth and more P-sensitive ones declining in abundance. Whilst the abundance of Proteaceae species in general was negatively impacted by incursion of nutrients and water from adjacent agricultural land, the abundance of <italic>Banksia prionotes</italic> increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C55">Grigg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Interestingly, both <italic>B. prionotes</italic> and <italic>B. sessilis</italic>, which we discussed above, are among very few Proteaceae species that inhabit the young and comparatively fertile coastal dunes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C37">Dixon, 2011</xref>) in south-western Australia, which are relatively nutrient rich in comparison to the much older and strongly weathered and acidic dunes on the Swan coastal plain and areas further inland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C81">Laliberté <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C87">Lambers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).Changes in resin P (i.e. readily available P; <bold>a</bold>), percentage canopy cover of Proteaceae species (<bold>b</bold>), and species richness of Proteaceae (<bold>c</bold>) along five stages of the Jurien Bay 2 million year dune chronosequence in south-western Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C81">Laliberté <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).

It has been marketed for several decades as the active ingredient released after hydrolysis of organic phosphonates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COT010F4">4</xref>b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C22">Cohen and Coffey, 1986</xref>) in fungicides such as Aliette<sup>®</sup> (i.e. Fosetyl-Al, aluminium tris-<italic>O</italic>-ethyl phosphonate; BayerCrop Science) and effectively applied against plant diseases (downy mildews, and root and crown rots) in crops such as stone fruits, pineapples, and vegetables, as well as turf grasses and ornamentals. Phosphite can protect individual plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C61">Hardy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), but it does not stop disease progression in native vegetation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C159">Shearer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C160">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C41">Dunne <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Phosphite does reduce mortality due to <italic>P. cinnamomi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C131">Pilbeam <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C192">Wilkinson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C8">Barrett <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), and it can slow the rate of disease centre extension and reduce the rate of plant mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C159">Shearer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004b</xref>). In the moderately resistant <italic>Lambertia formosa</italic> (Proteaceae) and the more susceptible <italic>Lambertia inermis</italic>, phosphite-induced protection is associated with increased superoxide release 8 h after inoculation, and increased phenylalanine ammonia lyase activity 24 h after inoculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C174">Suddaby <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In <italic>E. marginata</italic> (Myrtaceae), the effect of phosphite in controlling the pathogen is probably determined by the phosphite concentration at the host–pathogen interface. When phosphite concentrations within the roots are low, it primes the tissue for a stronger and faster defence response upon pathogen infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C72">Jackson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Phosphite induces the host's defence against <italic>P. cinnamomi</italic> as well as a wide range of other pathogens, ranging from oomycetes to fungi and nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C144">Reuveni <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C3">Aguín <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C123">Oka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C130">Percival <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C103">Lobato <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Phosphite-induced resistance can protect treated plants for extended periods of months or even years before re-application becomes necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C182">Tynan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C42">Dunstan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). High phosphite concentrations in the root tissue act directly on the pathogen to inhibit its growth before it can establish an association with the host, and the host defences remain unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C72">Jackson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>).Although the term ‘fungicide’ is often used to describe the direct effect of phosphite on oomycete pathogens, it is in fact a biostat, because phosphite does not kill the pathogen, but only slows its growth. This is mainly explained by its impact on metabolism, most probably impairing phosphate homeostasis and metabolic reactions, at least partly through mimicking phosphate while not being metabolized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C54">Griffith <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C7">Barchietto <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C121">Niere <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>). Despite the wide and successful use of phosphite to prevent the spread of <italic>P. cinnamomi</italic>, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effect of induced resistance in the plant is scant. Studies in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> have enabled the mode of phosphite action to be analysed at the molecular level. The plant hormone salicylic acid, a well-known signalling molecule in defence responses, and the transcription co-activator NPR1 (non-expressor of PR1), involved in the salicylic acid-dependent signalling pathway, are important components in the mechanisms leading to increased resistance after phosphite application. Mutant plants impaired in the accumulation of salicylic acid or its signalling cascade show reduced phosphite-induced resistance against the oomycete pathogen <italic>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C111">Molina <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C48">Friedrich <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Moreover, phosphite application can lead to a stronger and faster defence response in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> subsequently inoculated with <italic>H. arabidopsidis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C107">Massoud <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). This response involves the proteins EDS1 (enhanced disease susceptibility 1) and PAD4 (phytoalexin deficient 4), which are upstream of salicylic acid, and the mitogen activated protein kinase MPK4. This augmented activation of resistance mechanisms by pre-treatment with low levels of the inducing chemical, often leading to local and systemic immunity, has been known for a long time and termed ‘defence priming’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C25">Conrath <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Interestingly, this acquired primed state can be passed on to the offspring by epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C105">Luna <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C140">Rasmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C165">Slaughter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). This transgenerational induced resistance has the potential for an inheritable adaptation to pathogen pressure and might also explain the long-lasting effect of phosphite applications if similar epigenetic modifications are induced. Thus, understanding of the molecular mechanism of phosphite action has great potential. Current ‘omics technologies (i.e. genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) allow determination of phosphite-induced changes in gene expression, and protein and metabolite abundances. Their application will allow a detailed description of the impact of phosphite on a whole-systems scale, and will help in the identification of key targets of phosphite, thus creating a knowledge base for the targeted development of alternative compounds. Although this type of approach is especially applicable to plant model species, such as <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, because of a highly developed genetic and molecular tool kit, similar approaches and translational knowledge transfer become increasingly applicable for non-model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C87">Lambers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).As discussed above, phosphite is oxidized to phosphate by soil microbes, potentially shifting the balance between highly P-efficient, non-mycorrhizal species and less P-efficient ones. Finding an alternative to phosphite would prevent the indirect increase of P availability in native ecosystems. The need for such alternatives is also apparent from reports of oomycete pathogens developing resistance to phosphite, as has been observed for lettuce downy mildew (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C13">Brown <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Chemicals with similar defence-inducing properties, such as the salicylic acid analogue benzo-(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C3">3</xref>)-thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid and the non-proteinogenic amino acid β-aminobutyric acid are available, and their efficacy has been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C26">Conrath, 2009</xref>). So far, large-scale application, similar to phosphite, has not been successful, not even in agricultural systems that are easier to manage. Nevertheless, knowledge gained concerning these compounds will also improve our understanding of the mode of phosphite action and the identification of practical alternative compounds.<italic>Banksia anatona</italic> (A.S.George) A.R.Mast &amp; K.R.Thiele (cactus banksia) is an IUCN Red List Critically Endangered ranked species at extremely high risk of extinction in the wild, because of <italic>P. cinnamomi</italic> infestations.

Different columns with the same colour refer to different quadrats (Fig. 6b) for the same treatment; three trees within each quadrat were sampled, and four leaves per plant were used. Missing bars are due to the fact that trees had succumbed to the pathogen before sampling had commenced.With the exact molecular mode of phosphite action being unknown, it is important also to consider its impact on P-signalling networks in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C179">Ticconi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C184">Varadarajan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Disturbances in nutrient ­homeostasis have recently been shown to impact directly on ­­plant–pathogen interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C126">Pannell and Ewing, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C183">Van Damme <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C173">Stuttmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C5">lvarez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C79">Kruse <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Therefore, phosphite may interact with P<sub>i</sub>-signalling components that could trigger the suggested priming of defence responses. Phosphate-signalling networks can include both local and systemic signalling pathways, and it has been assumed that local responses are triggered upon the recognition of P<sub>i</sub> itself, while systemic responses may be triggered by changes in hormone levels or in a yet to be identified organic phosphate ester pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C101">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C177">Thibaud <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C18">Chiou and Lin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C120">Nagarajan and Smith, 2012</xref>). Given that phosphite cannot be metabolized by plants, it has been assumed only to interfere with the local sensing of P<sub>i</sub> itself; therefore, it has long been considered an excellent tool to distinguish between different sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C106">McDonald <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C180">Ticconi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Unfortunately, P<sub>i</sub> is a strong inhibitor of methylphosphonate (an organic analogue of phosphite) transport with an apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> of 5 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C133">Pratt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Phosphite and methylphosphonate also show different accumulation patterns in subcellular compartments compared with P<sub>i</sub> and are influenced by the presence of P<sub>i</sub> according to detailed nuclear magnetic resonance studies using cell culture systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C31">Danova-Alt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C133">Pratt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). These findings suggest that any observed effects of phosphite need to be interpreted with caution. They also suggest that the P status of the plant is critically important for phosphite acquisition and allocation, and may explain the varying degree of success of plant protection in the field. Starving plants of P<sub>i</sub> before the application of phosphite to circumvent some of these issues has been considered by Varadarajan and co-workers (2002); however, the strong overall growth inhibitory effects of phosphite on P-starved plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C176">Thao and Yamakawa, 2009</xref>) make it necessary to focus on short-term effects on P<sub>i</sub>-signalling networks, and carefully monitor its tissue accumulation patterns to distinguish clearly between primary and secondary effects. This growth inhibition could also cause species loss in severely P-impoverished landscapes. At this time, it is also unclear whether different PHT transporters have different affinities for phosphite. As a first step, these kinetic properties would need to be determined and compared with the kinetics of P<sub>i</sub> uptake in electrophysiological studies, as well as knock-out lines for individual transporters in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> or other model plant species. As it is not clear whether any of the known PHT transporters also acts as a tranceptor that signals the availability of P<sub>i</sub>, similar to the nitrate-sensing properties of the AtNTR1;1 transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C52">Gojon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), phosphite could directly interfere with this transceptor function, perturbing down-stream signalling pathways. Another possibility is that phosphite interferes with protein kinase/phosphatase regulatory units that control the phosphorylation status of PHT proteins, thereby regulating their incorporation into the plasma membrane (or their activity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C9">Bayle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).Phosphite competitively inhibits phosphate uptake by cluster roots in <italic>Hakea sericea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C169">Sousa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). It also ­triggers cluster-root development alongside other P-starvation responses in P-sufficient white lupin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C51">Gilbert <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Given the above-mentioned observations in model plant species, phosphite has the potential to suppress cluster-root development in P-limited Proteaceae and other cluster-root producing plant species. Thus, there could be direct implications for the phosphate-mining strategy of native Proteaceae species upon long-term exposure to phosphite. The exact time frame over which these changes might occur is unknown, and detailed monitoring of treated flora and plant communities is therefore recommended. Given that phosphite has been used for only 15 years, the tipping point may not yet have been reached.Mean Shannon-diversity (<bold>a</bold>) and evenness (<bold>b</bold>) for four ‘treatments’ (plus or minus <italic>P. cinnamomi</italic> and/or long-term phosphite spraying) at Gull Rock National Park, near Albany in Western Australia.

We surmise that this threat is very similar for other P-impoverished environments, including the fynbos in South Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C27">Cowling <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C145">Richards <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C100">Linder, 2005</xref>) and the cerrado in Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C43">Eiten, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C141">Ratter <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C95">Lannes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). To conserve the biodiversity of such habitats requires maintenance of low soil fertility, in particular a low soil P status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C64">Heddle and Specht, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C2">Adam, 2012</xref>). Minimizing the impact of run-off, P-containing fire suppressants, and pesticides, and maintaining a low fire frequency are therefore essential (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COT010TB1">1</xref>). In old, climatically buffered, infertile landscapes, P is the key nutrient that provides a threat to plant biodiversity, rather than nitrogen, which tends to be a key limiting factor in younger landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C68">Hopper, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C86">Lambers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Once these systems have been eutrophied, it is extremely difficult to restore their former glory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C171">Standish <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT010C172">Standish and Hobbs, 2010</xref>).Whilst <italic>P. cinnamomi</italic> is a major threat to Australia's biodiversity, combating it by using phosphite cannot be a viable long-term solution, because P enrichment of severely P-impoverished soils replaces one threat by another (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="COT010TB1">1</xref>). In the short term, in the absence of any alternative, phosphite applications are essential. However, what is urgently required is a much better understanding of how phosphite functions, so that we can work towards alternatives for phosphite to achieve the same immunizing effects that phosphite induces in plants in response to oomycete pathogens. Once we know which metabolites are affected by phosphite, we can target the metabolic pathways with which phosphite interacts. Based on that knowledge, we can screen alternative, non-P-containing compounds for their ability to induce the same defence mechanisms, and thus attempt to induce the same anti-<italic>Phytophthora</italic> effects as phosphite.Field work in Gull Rock and Stirling Range national parks was funded by Australian Research Council Industry Linkage Project ‘Susceptibility to <italic>Phytophthora cinnamomi</italic> and sensitivity to phosphorus in native Australian plants: why are they linked?’ (LP0776252), the Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) Western Australia, and a University of Western Australia Research Development Award.
