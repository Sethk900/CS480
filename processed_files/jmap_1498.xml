First-Year Responses of Cheatgrass Following Tamarix spp. Control and Restoration-Related Disturbances.Current invasion ecology theory predicts that disturbance will stimulate invasion by exotic plant species. Cheatgrass or Downy brome (<em>Bromus tectorum</em>) was surveyed in three sites near Florence, Colorado, U.S.A., immediately following Tamarisk or Saltcedar (<em>Tamarix </em>spp.) control and restoration activities that caused disturbance. Despite predictions to the contrary, neither mowing with heavy machinery nor tilling for seedbed preparation stimulated invasion, with a trend for the opposite pattern such that highest percent cover of <em>B. tectorum </em>was observed in the least disturbed transects. Aerial application of imazapyr for <em>Tamarix </em>spp. control caused mortality of nearly all <em>B. tectorum </em>and other understory plant species in all sites. Mechanical control of <em>Tamarix </em>spp. will not necessarily result in increased abundance of invasive species already present, possibly due to the effects of mulch usually left on-site. Imazapyr will control <em>B. tectorum </em>and other herbaceous understory species when applied aerially for <em>Tamarix </em>spp. control. These results are encouraging for managers of riparian systems who may fear that control of woody invasives will stimulate herbaceous invasions.
