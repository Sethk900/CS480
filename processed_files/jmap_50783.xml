Thermal onset of cellular and endocrine stress responses correspond to ecological limits in brook trout, an iconic cold-water fishLaboratory and field experiments were used to establish a temperature threshold for induction of the cellular and endocrine stress responses in brook trout that is similar to their proposed ecological thermal limit, suggesting that the induction of the stress response by temperature may be a mechanism that limits species distributions. Climate change is predicted to change the distribution and abundance of species, yet underlying physiological mechanisms are complex and methods for detecting populations at risk from rising temperature are poorly developed. There is increasing interest in using physiological mediators of the stress response as indicators of individual and population-level response to environmental stressors. Here, we use laboratory experiments to show that the temperature thresholds in brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) for increased gill heat shock protein-70 (20.7C) and plasma glucose (21.2C) are similar to their proposed thermal ecological limit of 21.0C. Field assays demonstrated increased plasma glucose, cortisol and heat shock protein-70 concentrations at field sites where mean daily temperature exceeded 21.0C. Furthermore, population densities of brook trout were lowest at field sites where temperatures were warm enough to induce a stress response, and a co-occurring species with a higher thermal tolerance showed no evidence of physiological stress at a warm site. The congruence of stress responses and proposed thermal limits supports the use of these thresholds in models of changes in trout distribution under climate change scenarios and suggests that the induction of the stress response by elevated temperature may play a key role in driving the distribution of species.
