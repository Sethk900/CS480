Acacia salicina, Pinus halepensis and Eucalyptus occidentalis improve soil surface conditions in arid southern Tunisia.Despite low growth rates, plants in arid areas have a strong ability to modify soil surface properties affecting ecosystem processes and community dynamics. But our knowledge on species effects on soil properties in these areas comes largely from observational studies, increasing the risk of confounding factors and precluding estimations of rates of change. We evaluated changes in soil surface properties underneath Acacia salicina, Pinus halepensis and Eucalyptus occidentalis in a 10-year-old common garden experiment established on a degraded Stipa tenacissima steppe in southern Tunisia. The three species tested improved soil properties compared to those of open areas. Acacia salicina ranked first as soil modifier as the soil underneath this species showed higher total organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, soil CO2 efflux and infiltration rate, and lower soil hydrophobicity than soil in open areas. The richness of vascular plants was higher under A. salicina than under the other types of cover. This species showed higher ability to improve microsite conditions and foster succession. Short rotations of A. salicina could thus be employed for the restoration of degraded S. tenacissima steppes provided that other aspects of its ecology are controlled. Pinus halepensis represents a good alternative when native species are a priority, albeit facilitative ability is lower.
