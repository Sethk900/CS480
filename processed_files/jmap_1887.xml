Describing breeding territories of migratory passerines: suggestions for sampling, choice of estimator, and delineation of core areas.<ol><li>The goals of this study were to investigate the possibility of using kernel techniques to estimate male breeding territory size and delineate core areas, focusing on a small nontransmitter bearing bird, the cerulean warbler. We then compared the performance of kernel estimators with traditionally used minimum convex polygons (MCP).</li><li>Given the lack of a consistent across-male sample size-area relationship, we opted to use each male's full set of locations in the kernel calculation rather than standardizing sample size across males.</li><li>All locations collected for each male were biologically independent though statistically autocorrelated. Subsampling locations did not achieve independence even at time intervals far exceeding biological independence.</li><li>The physical space bounded by kernel and MCP methods differed drastically in certain cases, especially in situations where there were large areas within a territory that were never visited during our data collection sessions.</li><li>Kernel methods of territory estimation were far more accurate and informative than MCP for cerulean warblers. We suggest that evenly sampling individuals in a biologically relevant manner during a strictly defined study period is more important than standardizing sample size across individuals. Furthermore, sampling regimes can safely be guided by biological vs. statistical independence timelines.</li><li>Avian biologists should consider kernel estimators as an option especially for habitat selection studies where accurate territory boundary and size estimation is crucial.</li></ol>
