Genetic diversity characterization of 24 populations comprising of 209 individuals representing the whole of the Indian Himalayas revealed that regardless of geographic location, all of the populations are intermixed and are composed broadly of two types of genetic populations. Our findings also suggested that these populations have evolved well in response to the environment. This study will help in the formulation of conservation programs for <italic>P. hexandrum</italic> populations in this region.Intraspecific genetic variation in natural populations governs their potential to overcome challenging ecological and environmental conditions. In addition, knowledge of this variation is critical for the conservation and management of endangered plant taxa. Found in the Himalayas, <italic>Podophyllum hexandrum</italic> is an endangered high-elevation plant species that has great medicinal importance. Here we report on the genetic diversity analysis of 24 <italic>P. hexandrum</italic> populations (209 individuals), representing the whole of the Indian Himalayas. In the present study, seven amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) primer pairs generated 1677 fragments, of which 866 were found to be polymorphic. Neighbour joining clustering, principal coordinate analysis and STRUCTURE analysis clustered 209 individuals from 24 populations of the Indian Himalayan mountains into two major groups with a significant amount of gene flow (<italic>N</italic><sub>m</sub> = 2.13) and moderate genetic differentiation <italic>F</italic><sub>st</sub>(0.196), <italic>Gâ€²</italic><sub>st</sub>(0.20). This suggests that, regardless of geographical location, all of the populations from the Indian Himalayas are intermixed and are composed broadly of two types of genetic populations. High variance partitioned within populations (80 %) suggests that most of the diversity is restricted to the within-population level. These results suggest two possibilities about the ancient population structure of <italic>P. hexandrum</italic>: either all of the populations in the geographical region of the Indian Himalayas are remnants of a once-widespread ancient population, or they originated from two types of genetic populations, which coexisted a long time ago, but subsequently separated as a result of long-distance dispersal and natural selection. High variance partitioned within the populations indicates that these populations have evolved in response to their respective environments over time, but low levels of heterozygosity suggest the presence of historical population bottlenecks.Throughout history, one of the many ways in which humans have benefited from plant diversity is as a source of traditional medicines. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as many as 80 % of the world's populations depend on traditional medicine for their primary health-care needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C73">WHO 1993</xref>). Most traditional therapy involves the use of plant extracts or their active principles. In the present era, unprecedented growth in global population has led to subsequent increase in human demands and overexploitation of the earth's plant resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C19">Gadgil and Meher-Homji 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C26">IÅŸik 2011</xref>). Most plausible scenarios today suggest that we are likely to lose a large part of our traditional wealth of medicinal plants in the near future if critical steps are not taken to conserve them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C14">Ehrlich and Daily 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C3">Badola and Aitken 2003</xref>). Currently, large numbers of medicinally important plant resources face serious threat of extinction and severe genetic loss, but detailed information is lacking. For most of these endangered medicinal plant species, effective conservation plans are minimal and very little material is available in genebanks. Further, a major emphasis on discovering new drug molecules from plant resources has contributed to the loss of natural genetic resources. Nearly 25 % of the estimated 250 000 species of vascular plants in the world may become extinct within the next 40 years, if proper conservation measures are not undertaken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C30">Kala 2000</xref>).Knowledge of genetic variation within species, coupled with information about their reproductive biology, is very important when establishing any conservation and management programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C52">Newton <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C29">Juan <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C18">Frankham 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C62">Silva <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>) aimed at preserving genetic variation within and among populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C15">Eriksson 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C62">Silva <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Knowledge of genetic diversity patterns is also important in understanding the evolutionary history of a species and in the assessment of future risks to diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C50">Neel and Ellstrand 2003</xref>). With regard to endangered species, measuring genetic variation among different populations is important for prioritization of sites and management choices for future conservation programmes. For example, greatly diverse or differentiated populations could be targeted for conservation, while genetically penurious populations might be targeted for management plans to restore diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C24">Godt <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C57">Petit <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>).In the present study, we quantified the patterns of genetic diversity within <italic>Podophyllum hexandrum</italic>, an endangered plant species of great medicinal importance. Using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers, we have examined 209 individuals of 24 natural populations of <italic>P. hexandrum</italic>, representing the wider geographical area of the entire Indian Himalayas ranging from the states of Jammu and Kashmir, and including the Zanskar region, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand to Sikkim. The genetic diversity of <italic>P. hexandrum</italic> has not been studied for the entire of the Indian Himalayas, and such a large geographical area with a greater number of samples has been analysed for the first time. The present study will comprehensively reveal the overall genetic diversity prevailing in these populations and will also aid in understanding the genetic dynamics of the species. Further, this will also throw light on how these populations are persisting despite their having a small chromosome number and self-pollinating reproductive behaviour.<italic>Podophyllum hexandrum</italic> (Himalayan mayapple; syn: <italic>Sinopodophyllum hexandrum</italic>, <italic>Podophyllum emodi</italic>) is a species of great medicinal importance. It is confined to the alpine regions of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, South West China and India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C1">Airi <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C9">Choudhary <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>). Despite its wider distribution in the entire Indian Himalayan range, from Ladakh to Sikkim at an elevation of 3000â€“4200 m, the current status of <italic>P. hexandrum</italic> is now endangered. The rhizomes and roots of <italic>P. hexandrum</italic> contain anti-tumour lignans such as podophyllotoxin, 4â€²-dimethyl podophyllotoxin and podophyllotoxin 4-<italic>O</italic>-glucoside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C67">Tyler <italic>et al.</italic> 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C6">Broomhead and Dewick 1990</xref>). Among these lignans, podophyllotoxin or podophylloresin is most important for its use in the semi-synthesis of anti-cancer drugs etoposide and teniposide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C27">Issell <italic>et al.</italic> 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C7">Canel <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>). Podophyllotoxin acts as an inhibitor of microtubule assembly. These drugs are used in the treatment of lung cancer, testicular cancer, neuroblastoma, hepatoma and other tumours. It also shows antiviral activities by interfering with some critical viral processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C22">Giri and Narasu 2000</xref>). The podophyllotoxin content of Himalayan mayapple is quite high (4.3 %) compared with other species of <italic>Podophyllum</italic>, notably <italic>Pelargonium peltatum</italic> (0.25 %), the most common species in the American subcontinent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C28">Jackson and Dewick 1984</xref>). However, the percentage of resin varies greatly at different growth phases, with age of the plant, seasonal variation and different geographical sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C59">Purohit <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>).The life cycle of <italic>P. hexandrum</italic> is 5â€“6 years. Flowers blossom before the leaves grow out. According to the latest report, occasional cross-pollination has been observed in <italic>P. hexandrum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C77">Xiong <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>); however, its morphological and biological characteristics are adapted to self-pollination and effective sexual reproduction. The self-pollination mechanism of the plant is very unique. When the flower is under blossom or just in blossom, the position of the gynoecium is upright; however, when it reaches full blossom stage, the gynoecium takes a full turn and because of this, the entire gynoecium gets closer to an anther to become pollinated. Fruit bearing is almost 100 %. Thus it appears the plant shows considerable fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C61">Shaobin <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C78">Xu <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>). The important point here is that most of the members of Berberidaceae are cross-pollinated including <italic>P. peltatum</italic>, the North American counterpart of Himalayan Mayapple. The disjunction between the two species is estimated to have happened âˆ¼6.52 Â± 1.89 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C38">Liu <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). Lack of pollinators and the nectarless character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C10">Crants 2008</xref>) of the flower might have been responsible for the evolution of self-pollination in this plant.In natural conditions, the dispersal of seeds is facilitated primarily by herbivores, mainly Himalayan grazers that travel great distances; hence the seed dispersal distance of <italic>P. hexandrum</italic> is reasonably good (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C60">Rajkumar and Ahuja 2010</xref>). <italic>Podophyllum hexandrum</italic> has a wide region of distribution; however, within that region, it appears primarily in valleys with secondary vegetation. In any given population, the plant shows a clumping distribution pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C42">Ma and Hu 1996</xref>).Traditionally, <italic>P. hexandrum</italic> has been used in folk medicine in small quantities by local healers as a cure for ulcers, cuts, wounds and skin diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C51">Negi <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>), but commercialization of this plant in recent years has increased the demand and consequent exploitation of the species. Owing to habitat fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C79">Young <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>), overexploitation, long dormancy, low rate of natural regeneration and overgrazing, it has been classified as an endangered species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C31">Kala 2005</xref>). There is an urgent need to conserve the genetic diversity of this prized medicinal plant, which may become extinct if its reckless exploitation continues. Earlier studies of genetic diversity in Himalayan populations have been restricted to a relatively limited geographic area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C75">Xiao <italic>et al.</italic> 2006<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C76"><italic>b</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C2">Alam <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C49">Naik <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C37">Li <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). As has been suggested by its pollination mechanism (namely, self-pollination), populations are expected to be genetically structured. Further, owing to a small chromosome number (2<italic>n</italic> = 12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C47">Nag and Rajkumar 2011</xref>) with a very large genome (<italic>C</italic> value = 16.075 Gb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C48">Nag <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>), <italic>P. hexandrum</italic> might be experiencing severe evolutionary pressure against adaptation as suggested by the large genome size constraint hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C34">Knight <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>).Details of the locations from where samples of <italic>P. hexandrum</italic> were collected for this study. <italic>N</italic>, number of individuals in a population.Geographic distribution of sampled populations of <italic>P. hexandrum</italic> from the Indian Himalayas with pie charts representing the percentage of the two genetic pools from each of the populations.

The large amount of data generated by the automated DNA analyser was checked manually a number of times to exclude unreliable detection and to improve the quality of data. The size range of amplified fragments, peak height threshold in terms of relative fluorescence units (rfu) and bandwidth were considered to be the most important scoring parameters; different sets of parameters were tested, and the parameter set that was optimized for the best fit was used for our analyses. Amplified fragments of 50â€“500 base pairs having present (1) and absent (0) peaks were extracted using GeneMapper 3.7. The resulting binary matrix was exported in the form of comma-separated text for data analysis.Calculations for genetic distance, pairwise population matrix of Nei's genetic identity, allele frequency by population, Mantel test for correlation of genetic and geographic distance and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) were conducted using GenAlEx 6.501 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C54">Peakall and Smouse 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C55">2012</xref>). STRUCTURE version 2.3.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C58">Pritchard <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>) was used to infer the genetic structure so as to obtain an estimate of the likely number of population genetic clusters (<italic>K</italic>). The numbers of clusters of the populations (<italic>K</italic>) were identified by performing six iterations and setting the value of <italic>K</italic> from 1 to 25 with a burn-in period of 100 000 and 100 000 number of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) repeats after burn-in. The maximal value of LnP(D), the posterior probability of data as per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C16">Evanno <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref>, was obtained using STRUCTURE HARVESTER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C13">Earl and vonHoldt 2012</xref>). To further confirm the number of genetic clusters, the value of <italic>K</italic> was estimated through analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA)-based clustering using kMeans software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C44">Meirmans 2012</xref>).

The efficiency of a DNA marker system for analysing diversity relies upon the extent of polymorphism detected by uncovering a large number of markers spanning the whole genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C40">Luikart <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>). Amplified fragment length polymorphism markers are ideal for detecting polymorphisms, as the variable regions detected are based on restriction enzyme sites and thus essentially reveal through whole-genome scans even minor genetic variations within any given organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C46">Mueller and Wolfenbarger 1999</xref>). We were able to obtain sufficient numbers of polymorphic markers (866; 51.65 %) for the estimation of population genetic parameters, in accordance with the criteria for the critical number of dominant markers suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C64">Staub <italic>et al.</italic> (2000)</xref>; (80 bands) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C43">Mariette <italic>et al.</italic> (2002)</xref>; (100â€“200 bands) for reliable estimation of population genetic parameters. Additionally, three primer combinations having detected a large number of bands suggest the potential of these markers for future population biology studies in this species.Generally, taxa with self-pollinating behaviour have the majority of variance partitioned among populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C39">Loveless and Hamrick 1984</xref>). This species, therefore, might be expected to have a diverse distribution of AFLP variation among populations, but the present study does not support this <italic>a-priori</italic> expectation in overall levels of inter-population differentiation across the 24 populations surveyed (within population 80 % and among population 20 %, with <italic>F</italic><sub>st</sub> = 0.196 and <italic>Gâ€²</italic><sub>st</sub> = 0.20). However, significant population differentiation reported previously in allozymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C5">Bhadula <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>) and various DNA fingerprinting marker studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C75">Xiao <italic>et al.</italic> 2006<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C76"><italic>b</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C2">Alam <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C49">Naik <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>) might have resulted due to the fact that the targeted populations were locally restricted, which is also congruent with differentiation inferences in the subpopulation in the current study. Current inferences are based on sampled populations from a wide geographical range covering the whole of the Indian Himalayas. Moreover, low population size also leads to lower levels of genetic variation, which is a general trend in endangered plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C39">Loveless and Hamrick 1984</xref>). The number of plants of <italic>P. hexandrum</italic> is very small as compared with other non-endangered plants found in any of the locations we sampled. The overall genetic differentiation between the populations in this study was found to be moderate (<italic>F</italic><sub>st</sub> = 0.196, <italic>Gâ€²</italic><sub>st</sub> = 0.20), which is evident from the cluster analysis, as all the individuals from a population remain clustered in either of the two groups, confirming that genetic structure, although weak, is present in these populations. Low values of unbiased heterozygosity (u<italic>h</italic> = 0.043â€“0.155) and Shannon's information index (<italic>I</italic> = 0.048â€“0.185) suggest that population bottlenecks resulted due to small population size. This also accounts for reduced genetic variation among the sampled populations in the present study.Although self-pollinated, <italic>P. hexandrum</italic> is also capable of occasional cross-pollination, and this phenomenon accounts for another source of low genetic variation among populations. The seed set in the cross-pollinated plants is found to be almost the same as that in self-fertilized plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C77">Xiong <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>) and it is believed that self-pollinated species are almost always derived from cross-fertilizing ancestors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C65">Stebbins 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C74">Wyatt 1988</xref>). <italic>Podophyllum peltatum</italic>, the species found in the North American subcontinent, is cross-pollinated (i.e. self-incompatible; SI) whereas <italic>P. hexandrum</italic> is self-compatible (SC). The sister relationship between the two species is well documented, and it is estimated that these species became separated âˆ¼6.94 Â± 3.94 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C38">Liu <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). The disjunction between the two species coincides with the time of upsurge of the Himalayas, and it appears that the self-pollinating mode of reproduction has evolved from the cross-fertilizing <italic>P. peltatum</italic> and has also been proven phylogenetically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C72">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). The last rapid upsurge of the Himalayas began âˆ¼4â€“3 million years ago in the late Miocene. This suggests that a shift from SI to SC might have evolved as a result of this geographical development. The pollinator fauna are known to decline in terms of both species and number with rise in elevation. Thus, the uplifted habitat of the plant must have resulted in the scarcity of pollinators in early spring. In the process of evolution, the flower of <italic>P. hexandrum</italic> has adapted to delayed selfing, i.e. it tends to allow earlier cross-pollination to predominate when pollinators are available, which seems to be a reproductive strategy in response to the scarcity of the pollinators. Further, attractive, open, cup-shaped showy flowers with large anthers of <italic>P. hexandrum</italic> are characters of a cross-pollinating species. This suggests that the self-pollination mode of reproduction has evolved in this plant only to counter pollinator scarcity, although cross-pollination has not been eradicated. Self-pollination might have been responsible for the dispersal of populations across the Himalayas following Baker's rule, which suggests that following long-distance dispersal, a solitary propagule is much more likely to reproduce and generate a sexually reproducing population if it is capable of self-fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C4">Baker 1955</xref>). If the new colony thus established is well adapted to its new environment, it can spread throughout the area, where favourable conditions are found, even though its capacity for genetic variation is greatly reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C65">Stebbins 1957</xref>) and some of the traits become fixed due to genetic drift in the populations that are capable of self-pollination. These facts lead us to one of the two possible inferences derived from our study that populations from the Indian Himalayas are relics of a once-widespread ancestral stock, which subsequently became fragmented during the course of evolution. Another inference might be that all the populations prevailing in the Indian Himalayas have originated from two types of genetic populations fixed due to natural selection a long time ago. This is also evident from the fact that in the cluster analysis, most of the individuals from the similar genetic population remained in the same group regardless of their geographical location. It also suggests that during the course of evolution, genotypes favoured by natural selection have been dispersed in the Himalayan region and have maintained themselves as constant, genetically similar lines for many generations. Although there is no distinct geographical barrier shown in the cluster analysis, six out of seven populations from the Pir Panjal range cluster into one group and three out of four populations from the Dhauladhar ranges cluster into another group. Out of four populations from the Garhwal Himalayas, two populations cluster into either group, as is the case of populations from the Greater Himalayan range which also cluster into both the groups.Dispersal of pollens and migration of seeds determine the patterns of gene dispersion within and among populations after reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C39">Loveless and Hamrick 1984</xref>). The low levels of variance partitioned among populations suggest that a good level of gene flow is present among the populations of the Indian Himalayas, which is aptly confirmed by gene flow calculations (<italic>N</italic><sub>m</sub> = 2.13). The phenology of <italic>P. hexandrum</italic> suggests that pollen dispersal cannot be a factor accounting for the gene flow, which means that high gene flow is a result of seed dispersal. The fruits of <italic>P. hexandrum</italic> contain numerous seeds (80â€“120) <bold>[<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aobpla.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aobpla/plu076/-/DC1" xlink:type="simple">see Supporting Information</ext-link>]</bold>. A significant amount of gene flow was recorded across all the populations of the Indian Himalayas. The fruit is a berry which is not edible initially, but becomes edible as it ripens, and Himalayan birds and grazing animals feed on these fruits, thus facilitating seed dispersal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C60">Rajkumar and Ahuja 2010</xref>). Further, the seed dispersal distance depends on various factors including the flight range of the birds and migration status of the grazers. All of the sites from which these populations were collected were situated in Himalayan regions that are accessed annually by numbers of tourists through the trekking trails of the Himalayas. Collectively, these short trails form a network known as â€œThe Greater Himalayan Trailâ€ which ranges from Nanga Parbat in Pakistan to Namcha Barwa in Tibet and includes the Himalayan mountains falling in the vicinity of Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan and part of Tibet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C25">Harris 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C8">Choegyal 2011</xref>). In the cluster analysis, the population from the Sikkim region has been clustered along with the populations from the Pir Panjal range. The Sikkim population has been situated in the Kangchenjunga Himal section of the Greater Himalayas, which is located in the northeastern part of the Himalayas. This clustering suggests that these regions experience a significant amount of anthropogenic interference, and this activity also plays a major role in the dispersal of the germplasm along these trails, helping to increase the gene flow. High gene flow results in dampening of the local adaptation due to its homogenizing effect, which prevents population differentiation.Furthermore, various reports suggest the unsustainable extraction of various medicinal plants from the Western Himalayas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C30">Kala 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C31">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C69">Uniyal <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C32">Kala and Farooquee 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C33">Kala <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C36">Larsen and Olsen 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C35">Larsen 2014</xref>). One such report has been published regarding the exploitation of <italic>Picrorhiza kurroa</italic>, another endangered medicinal plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C68">Uniyal <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>) found in habitats like those of <italic>P. hexandrum</italic>. A similar kind of exploitation occurs for <italic>P. hexandrum</italic>. One can easily find seeds and roots of <italic>P. hexandrum</italic> by visiting the local healers and traditional medicinal practitioners at high elevations. Drug dealers follow the same Greater Himalayan Trail for trading of the raw material and drugs, also facilitating seed dispersal.The number of seeds produced per plant is large, but the germination percentage is quite low (7â€“45 %). The seeds remain dormant for up to 3 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU076C63">Sreenivasulu <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). The production of a large number of seeds might be an adaptive strategy, so that a few, if not all, might germinate and establish new individuals, and as mentioned earlier, a solitary propagule is potent enough to produce a population if it is capable of self-pollination. This might have resulted in a population with the same genetic pool as that of the seed which was established after long-distance dispersal. The phenomenon of establishment of genetically similar populations following long-distance seed dispersal seems to have resulted in the two genetic populations present today.Based on the comprehensive molecular analysis of natural populations of <italic>P. hexandrum,</italic> it can be assumed that all the populations found in the Indian Himalayas are descendants of either one parent population from which two types of genotypes diverged or two different parent populations from different regions, whose dispersal to other regions was facilitated by humans, animals and birds. High variance partitioned within populations indicates that these populations are well sustained, but high levels of anthropogenic interference and habitat fragmentation are major threats for the sustainability of this plant in nature. Low levels of genetic diversity also pose a concern about the survival of the populations against ecological bottlenecks in the future. Moreover, stern conservation measures and laws need to be implemented urgently to limit the unauthorized uprooting and illegal trade of the rhizomes. The extent of overexploitation is such that during our frequent visits to the field, we found a significant amount of loss in the number of individuals within a season or two (e.g. between 2009 and 2011), the average number of plants per quadrat (1 m<sup>2</sup>) decreasing from 2 to 0.6 at Prashar (data not shown). If effective conservation measures are not undertaken soon, we are likely to lose the invaluable genetic resources of this important medicinal plant. Inferences derived from the current study will help to guide management and conservation policies. Moreover, high-throughput sequencing efforts are required to study environmental effects on the adaptation mechanism. This type of study will be extremely helpful in understanding the genes involved in divergent selection and local adaptation.This research work was funded by the <grant-sponsor xlink:type="simple">Council of Scientific and Industrial Research</grant-sponsor> (CSIR), Government of India.R.K.S. and A.N. designed the study.
