We thus aim at helping to advance our knowledge on the existence of a biodiversity threshold, which should depend on how many species in a community belongs to each of the groups with distinct habitat requirements and distinct responses to the loss of native vegetation. Our results suggest that despite differential responses to habitat loss among forest specialist, habitat generalist and open-area specialist species, a strong biodiversity threshold can be observed across fragmented landscapes.   This study is part of a larger multi-taxa project carried out by a group of researchers from the Universidade Federal da Bahia - UFBA, which focus on the effects of habitat loss on eight distinct taxonomic groups in the Atlantic Forest of Bahia, Brazil.   Trapping, handling and specimens collection were approved by IBAMA - Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais RenovÃ¡veis (license number 12023-3). Because our study involved capture and handling of small mammals in the field, it did not receive an approval in advance from the Committee for Animal Use of the Institute of Biology -UFBA (ComissÃ£o de Ã‰tica no Uso de Animais â€“ CEUA, http://www.ceua.ufba.br), which only requires approval for studies on vertebrates that include experimentation (e.g. maintenance in captivity, injection of drugs, or surgery). However, retrospective approval was subsequently obtained from the UFBA CEUA (approval number 13/2013). Trapping, handling and euthanasia methods followed the guidelines of the American Society of Mammalogists Animal Care and Use Committee. No in vivo procedures were carried out prior to humane euthanasia of animals executed by gradual hypoxia with CO2. The specimens collected are deposited at the Museum of Zoology, UFBA, in compliance with national laws (IN 154/IBAMA). We did not sample either protected areas or species.  Black â€“ forest remnants; dark gray â€“ area proposed as historical forest refugia; light gray â€“ non-refugial area; squares â€“ location of the five studied landscapes.  Our sampling is spatially rather than temporally replicated, and was designed to provide a comparable, standardized snap-shot of the small mammal communities across landscapes with different amounts of forest cover. However, we controlled for temporal variation by sampling all landscapes within the same season and year, and all sites within each landscape simultaneously (see below).   We sampled small non-volant mammals (rodents and marsupials) in all 80 sites (8 forest and 8 matrix sites in each of the five landscapes) using both pitfall traps (35 l) and medium-sized live traps similar to Sherman (10 x 10 x 30 cm) and Tomahawk (15 x 17 x 45 cm). In each sampling site we established two 100-m long trap lines, 5 m apart from each other: one containing 10 equidistant pitfall traps connected by a 50-cm high plastic drift fence, and the other containing 20 equidistant live traps on the ground (10 of each type). We baited the traps with a mixture of peanut butter, sunflowers seeds, oat grains, palm-oil and sardines. We conducted one capture session of eight days in each site, totaling 240 traps x night per site, 3840 traps x night per landscape and 19200 traps x night in the whole study. All sites and landscapes were sampled in the dry season, between January to March and September to November of 2011. The sixteen sites in a landscape were sampled simultaneously and thus the sampling of each landscape took around 10 days.    Captured specimens were collected and are deposited at the Museum of Zoology of UFBA. We identified small mammals to species level following the literature and consulting the specialists Yuri Leite and Leonora Costa from Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo.    For each of the three habitat requirement categories as well as for the entire small mammal community, we quantified: (1) the number of species (alpha diversity) and the total number of captured individuals (abundance) in each forest and matrix site, and (2) the total number of captured species (gamma diversity) within the set of eight forest sites, the set of eight matrix sites, and the set of all 16 sites in each landscape (irrespective of habitat type). We then plotted across landscapes with increasing amount of remaining forest (5% to 45%): (1) the mean and the 95% confidence interval of the abundance and alpha diversity among sites in forests, in matrix habitats, and in the landscape (irrespective of habitat type); (2) the gamma diversity per each habitat type and per landscape.  To highlight differences in species composition between habitats and landscapes, we also run a Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS, two axes), using the Jaccard similarity index on the presence/ absence matrix of all small mammal species per habitat type and landscape.   A total of 242 individuals of 24 different species were captured; 91 individuals representing eight forest specialist species, 66 individuals representing eight habitat generalist species, and 85 individuals representing eight open-area specialist species.   For abundance and alpha diversity, the mean and 95% confidence interval among the eight surveyed sites per landscape are shown. A. Forest specialist species; B. Habitat generalist species; C. Open-area specialist species; D. Small mammal community.  For abundance and alpha diversity, the mean and 95% confidence interval among the eight surveyed sites per landscape are shown. A.

Our work used a spatially-replicated dataset to investigate the differential responses of groups of species with different habitat requirements to both matrix habitats and forest loss, allowing us to investigate the existence of a biodiversity threshold. Below, we first discuss the differential responses to forest loss among small mammal assemblages with different habitat requirements (forest specialists, habitat generalists and open-area specialists). We then discuss the observed species spillover between forests and anthropogenic habitats, and the observed different ecological thresholds across the gradient of habitat loss. Lastly, we point out our main conclusions and the potential consequences of the biodiversity threshold we observed.   It is important to mention, though, that the pattern of increased abundance and diversity of generalists in intermediately-forested landscapes was most evident in forests, while in the matrix habitat generalists were most common and diverse in more forested landscapes, as forest specialists. Therefore, even considering habitat generalists, the matrix of highly deforested landscapes supports very few species, with potential consequences for ecological functioning in the anthropogenic habitats of these degraded landscapes (see below).   From the distinct responses among habitat requirement categories described above, interesting patterns of species spillover between habitats in fragmented landscapes emerge. We observed that cross habitat species spillover occurred only from forests to the matrix (and not from the matrix to forests), but just in forested landscapes, with potential consequences to ecological functioning and services in anthropogenic habitats.
