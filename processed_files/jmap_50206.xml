Regional nitrogen budget of the Lake Victoria Basin, East Africa: syntheses, uncertainties and perspectivesAbstract Using the net anthropogenic nitrogen input (NANI) approach we estimated the N budget for the Lake Victoria Basin in East Africa. The NANI of the basin ranged from 887 to 3008 kg N km2 yr1 (mean: 1827 kg N km2 yr1) for the period 19952000. The net nitrogen release at basin level is due primarily to livestock and human consumption of feed and foods, contributing between 69 and 85. Atmospheric oxidized N deposition contributed approximately 14 to the NANI of the Lake Victoria Basin, while either synthetic N fertilizer imports or biological N fixations only contributed less than 6 to the regional NANI. Due to the low N imports of feed and food products (<20 kg N km2 yr1), nitrogen release to the watershed must be derived from the mining of soil N stocks. The fraction of riverine N export to Lake Victoria accounted for 16, which is much lower than for watersheds located in Europe and USA (25). A significant reduction of the uncertainty of our N budget estimate for Lake Victoria Basin would be possible if better data on livestock systems and riverine N export were available. Our study indicates that at present soil N mining is the main source of nitrogen in the Lake Victoria Basin. Thus, sustainable N management requires increasing agricultural N inputs to guarantee food security and rehabilitation and protection of soils to minimize environmental costs. Moreover, to reduce N pollution of the lake, improving management of human and animal wastes needs to be carefully considered in future.
