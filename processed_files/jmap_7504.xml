Breading season, sexual rate and fecundity of Basilichthys Australis Eigenmann 1927, from Maipo River, Chile. (Atherinidae, Pisces)Summary Breading season, sexual rate, fecundity and minimum size for reproduction was studied in Basilichthys australis Eigenmann 1927. Monthly samples were collected with a gill net from a river of the central part of Chile. It was found that the spawning period lasts from August to November, the smaller mature female had 176 mm T.L. Some changes in the sexual rate suggest a migration to the sea during summer time; the relative fecundity kept a relation of F = 0.0001 L327. However, according to the diameter of the eggs these would only have a viability of 32%.
