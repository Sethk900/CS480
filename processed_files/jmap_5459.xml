Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the gene encoding interleukinâ€6 of the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca)In the present study, the cloning and sequence analysis of interleukinâ€6 (ILâ€6) from the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) were described. Sequencing revealed that ILâ€6 complementary DNA contains a 636 baseâ€pair open reading frame encoding 211 amino acids. Homology analyses indicated that the identity levels of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of ILâ€6 between the giant panda and other species in Carnivora ranged from 90.5% to 85.6% and from 82.9% to 76.5%, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses based on nucleotide and amino acid sequences showed that the harbour seal shared a closer relationship with the giant panda than other carnivores (ursids not included). The functionally important domains and sites that have previously been recognized in other carnivores were all observed in the ILâ€6 sequence of the giant panda. These findings suggest that the complementary DNA fragment cloned is indeed the ILâ€6 molecule with biological activity and can be used in immunological studies of the giant panda.
