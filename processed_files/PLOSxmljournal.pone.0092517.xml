However, in very nutrient-poor ecosystems, enhanced N input can, in the short-term, promote diversity. Mediterranean Basin ecosystems are nutrient-limited biodiversity hotspots, but no information is available on their medium- or long-term responses to enhanced N input. Since 2007, we have been manipulating the form and dose of available N in a Mediterranean Basin maquis in south-western Europe that has low ambient N deposition (&lt;4 kg N ha<sup>âˆ’1</sup> yr<sup>âˆ’1</sup>) and low soil N content (0.1%). N availability was modified by the addition of 40 kg N ha<sup>âˆ’1</sup> yr<sup>âˆ’1</sup> as a 1âˆ¶1 NH<sub>4</sub>Cl to (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> mixture, and 40 and 80 kg N ha<sup>âˆ’1</sup> yr<sup>âˆ’1</sup> as NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>. Over the following 5 years, the impacts on plant composition and diversity (richness and evenness) and some ecosystem characteristics (soil extractable N and organic matter, aboveground biomass and % of bare soil) were assessed. Plant species richness increased with enhanced N input and was more related to ammonium than to nitrate. Exposure to 40 kg NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N ha<sup>âˆ’1</sup> yr<sup>âˆ’1</sup> (alone and with nitrate) enhanced plant richness, but did not increase aboveground biomass; soil extractable N even increased under 80 kg NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>-N ha<sup>âˆ’1</sup> yr<sup>âˆ’1</sup> and the % of bare soil increased under 40 kg NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N ha<sup>âˆ’1</sup> yr<sup>âˆ’1</sup>. The treatment containing less ammonium, 40 kg NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>-N ha<sup>âˆ’1</sup> yr<sup>âˆ’1</sup>, did not enhance plant diversity but promoted aboveground biomass and reduced the % of bare soil. Data suggest that enhanced NH<sub>y</sub> availability affects the structure of the maquis, which may promote soil erosion and N leakage, whereas enhanced NO<sub>x</sub> availability leads to biomass accumulation which may increase the fire risk. These observations are relevant for land use management in biodiverse and fragmented ecosystems such as the maquis, especially in conservation areas.We report 5 years of results from an N-manipulation field experiment, focusing on N-driven changes among the plant community and soil characteristics in a Mediterranean Basin maquis. Specifically, we focused on the following ecosystem features: vascular plant community (composition, richness and evenness), aboveground biomass (standing biomass and litter production), soil extractable N (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and nitrate â€“ NO<sub>3</sub><sup>âˆ’</sup>) and organic matter, and percentage of bare soil.Mean monthly temperature (light grey) and total monthly precipitation (black). Arrows represent the time of N additions from January 2007 to June 2011. Asterisks refers to the occasions of plant community assessments (2007, 2008 and 2011). Litterfall was collected from April to December 2010. â€œ#Bâ€ refers to the time of aboveground biomass sampling (June 2011).The difference in life span between the N-benefited (with short life cycles, including annuals) and the N-affected species (perennials), which would allow the detection of the incomers but only drastic impacts on the losers;In general, N-enhanced plant richness was not linked with functional alterations, mainly because the N-benefited species were small short-lived plants, providing a minor contribution to ecosystem functions while the N-affected plants were perennial shrubs, which underpin ecosystem functions.In contrast, the lower NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N dose applied to the combined N treatment (40AN) plots, with fewer plant species, improved aboveground biomass and soil protection most effectively by almost fully covering the soil with plants. Erosion can also be increased indirectly as a result of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>âˆ’</sup> deposition increasing aboveground biomass and the risk of wildfires, indicating that increasing urbanisation also threatens these ecosystems. Land managers and planners need to be aware of these effects before they authorise expansion of such N sources close to these ecosystems.(DOCX)(DOCX)(DOCX)We are grateful to Steve Houghton for help with the manuscript's preparation and to the two reviewers for the comments and suggestions, which greatly improved the present paper.
