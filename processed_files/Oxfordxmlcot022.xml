One of the reasons for this controversy is that there are few mechanistic studies that explore the links among climate change, infectious disease, and declines of host populations. Given that hostâ€“parasite interactions are generally mediated by physiological responses, we submit that physiological models could facilitate the prediction of how hostâ€“parasite interactions will respond to climate change, and might offer theoretical and terminological cohesion that has been lacking in the climate changeâ€“disease literature. We stress that much of the work on how climate influences hostâ€“parasite interactions has emphasized changes in climatic means, despite a hallmark of climate change being changes in climatic variability and extremes. Owing to this gap, we highlight how temporal variability in weather, coupled with non-linearities in responses to mean climate, can be used to predict the effects of climate on hostâ€“parasite interactions. We also discuss the climate variability hypothesis for disease-related declines, which posits that increased unpredictable temperature variability might provide a temporary advantage to pathogens because they are smaller and have faster metabolisms than their hosts, allowing more rapid acclimatization following a temperature shift. In support of these hypotheses, we provide case studies on the role of climatic variability in host population declines associated with the emergence of the infectious diseases chytridiomycosis, withering syndrome, and malaria. Finally, we present a mathematical model that provides the scaffolding to integrate metabolic theory, physiological mechanisms, and large-scale spatiotemporal processes to predict how simultaneous changes in climatic means, variances, and extremes will affect hostâ€“parasite interactions. However, several outstanding questions remain to be answered before investigators can accurately predict how changes in climatic means and variances will affect infectious diseases and the conservation status of host populations.Over the past 50â€…years, scientists have documented significant anthropogenic climate change and extraordinary biodiversity losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C95">Walther <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C89">Stuart <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C91">Thomas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C65">Parmesan, 2006</xref>). Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are affecting several components of climate, including temperature and precipitation means, variances, and extremes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C24">Easterling <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C53">Meehl <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C54">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C76">Raisanen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C42">Kunkel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Both paleontological and contemporary data suggest that such changes in temperature and precipitation can contribute to declines in biodiversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C95">Walther <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C89">Stuart <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C91">Thomas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C65">Parmesan, 2006</xref>). Indeed, there is evidence that recent climate changes have already caused population declines or extirpations of lizards, corals, butterflies, and polar bears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C88">Stirling <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C16">Bruno <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C86">Sinervo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C14">Breed <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Moreover, projected climate-induced faunal changes suggest profound changes in populations of numerous species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C45">Lawler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).Alongside changes in climate, scientists have also documented unprecedented rates of emerging infectious diseases over the last 50â€…years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C19">Daszak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C89">Stuart <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C91">Thomas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C37">Jones <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C43">Lafferty, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C83">Rohr <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011a</xref>). Although it was traditionally assumed that parasites did not cause extinctions of their host populations because parasites themselves require a threshold host population size to persist, we know now that there are several conditions in which parasites can cause host population extinctions, such as when the parasite can persist in alternative hosts or environmental reservoirs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C21">de Castro and Bolker, 2005</xref>). Even if these conditions do not occur, parasites can drive host populations to low levels and, coupled with demographic stochasticity, can contribute to host extinctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C21">de Castro and Bolker, 2005</xref>). For example, emerging infections have been linked to population declines of chestnut, elm, pine, and oak trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C2">Anagnostakis, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C50">Mamiya, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C12">Brasier, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C80">Rizzo and Garbelotto, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C3">Anderson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C83">Rohr <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011a</xref>). Emerging fungal infections are driving losses of amphibians, snakes, bees, crayfish, and bats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C49">McCallum <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C83">Rohr <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C27">Fisher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Malaria is believed to have caused declines in the diversity of Hawaiian birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C93">Vanriper <italic>et al.</italic>, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C28">Garamszegi, 2011</xref>), and an infectious cancer has caused the near extinction of the Tasmanian devil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C49">McCallum <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C83">Rohr <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C27">Fisher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Consequently, increases in infectious diseases often threaten biodiversity.Several researchers have suggested that climate change is indirectly contributing to biodiversity losses by increasing the spread and emergence of infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C26">Epstein, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C30">Harvell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C43">Lafferty, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C83">Rohr <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011a</xref>). Nonetheless, the extent to which climate change causes increases in some diseases but declines in others is an area of active debate, and more studies are required to identify the diseases that will be likely to pose the greatest risk in the event of future climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C43">Lafferty, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C83">Rohr <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011a</xref>). Mechanistic studies of how climate change influences disease will help clarify this debate for several reasons. First, mechanisms provide concrete evidence of a cause-and-effect relationship between a change in climate and an increase in infectious disease. Such evidence is urgently needed to enable identification of the diseases, regions, and species most likely to face increased disease threats with climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C83">Rohr <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011a</xref>). Second, our predictions for how hostâ€“parasite interactions will respond to shifts in climate should improve if we understand the underlying mechanisms linking these factors. Finally, understanding the mechanistic links between climate and disease should allow us to develop more effective measures targeted at mitigating the threats posed to species by pathogens.Flowchart highlighting the importance of physiology in understanding the influence of climate on hostâ€“parasite interactions and changes in host population densities.The goal of this paper is to explore how physiology and disease ecology can be better integrated to understand the outcome of climateâ€“disease interactions, especially those that involve species of conservation concern. We first offer background on the physiology and thermal biology of hostâ€“parasite interactions. We stress that much of the work on how climate influences hostâ€“parasite interactions has emphasized changes in climate means, despite a hallmark of climate change being alterations in climate variability and extremes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C24">Easterling <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C53">Meehl <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C54">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C76">Raisanen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C42">Kunkel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Owing to this gap in the literature, we highlight the role of climatic variability in driving hostâ€“parasite interactions. Specifically, we discuss how non-linearities in response to mean climate, coupled with temporal variability in weather and organismal acclimatization responses, can be used to predict the effects of climate on hostâ€“parasite interactions. We propose that the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) offers an instrument to integrate physiological mechanisms and large-scale spatiotemporal processes to enable successful prediction of how changes to climatic means, variances, and extremes will affect hostâ€“parasite interactions. We then provide a quantitative example for how metabolic theory can be used to derive models of hostâ€“parasite interactions in a changing temperature environment. Finally, we end with conclusions and outstanding questions.In this section, we explore the application of approaches from thermal biology to hostâ€“parasite interactions. We begin by defining performance curves and show how they can be used to predict hostâ€“parasite interactions, highlighting differences in the temperature-dependent defense strategies of ecto- and endothermic hosts. We then discuss the importance of phenotypic plasticity of hosts and parasites to temporal variability in temperature, emphasizing likely differences in the acclimatization rates of hosts and parasites.Model predictions for temperature dependence of <italic>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</italic> infection on Cuban treefrogs (<italic>Osteopilus septentrionalis</italic>).

The within-host parasite replication rate (Î») is a function of parasite infectivity (intrinsic population growth rate of parasite within host) and host resistance (decrease in parasite growth rate as a result of host immune responses), and <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> is a function of Î». See main text for model equations and parameter values.There might also be fundamental differences in the thermal biology of parasitism in ectothermic vs. endothermic hosts, the latter of which has received more attention by ecological immunologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C51">Martin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The thermal environment of a parasite should be essentially constant within an endothermic host, which expends energy heating or cooling itself to maintain a constant internal temperature. Thus, effects of external temperature on the parasites of an endotherm might be indirect and driven primarily by energetic trade-offs between host thermoregulation and investment in immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C61">Nelson and Demas, 1996</xref>). This leads to a general prediction of decreased host resistance to infection when external temperatures are far from the host's optimal temperature, because an endotherm would need to invest more in maintaining its internal temperature, thereby leaving less energy available to invest in anti-parasite defenses. However, many endothermic hosts have parasites transmitted by ectothermic vectors, thus making many of the concepts discussed below regarding ectothermic hosts relevant to the transmission of vector-borne parasites to endothermic hosts.Parasites of ectothermic hosts might often experience different thermal environments from parasites of endothermic hosts, because the internal temperature of ectothermic hosts varies with external temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C4">Angilletta, 2009</xref>). Thus, both the host and the parasite must adapt to temperature at the tissue level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C75">Raffel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, lower temperatures will not necessarily drive energetic trade-offs between thermoregulation and the host immune response; indeed, many ectotherms expend less energy at lower temperatures because their metabolic rates are reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C29">Gillooly <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Depending on their specific thermal optima relative to hosts, pathogen and parasite growth rates might also decrease at lower temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C77">Ratkowsky <italic>et al.</italic>, 1982</xref>), such that a slower immune response might be sufficient to control infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C74">Raffel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C75">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C58">Murdock <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Thus, the effects of temperature on the parasites of ectothermic hosts should depend on the thermal performance curves of both parasite growth (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COT022F2">2</xref>) and host resistance and might be driven less by energetic trade-offs with host thermoregulation than they are for endothermic hosts. Importantly, much of the work in thermal biology has been conducted on organismal responses to mean temperature, despite climate change also affecting temporal variability in temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C24">Easterling <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C7">Benedetti-Cecchi, 2003</xref>).Thermal biology also provides insights into potential effects of sudden shifts in temperature on hostâ€“parasite interactions. Biologists have long known that organisms can respond to a temperature shift by adjusting their physiological systems to operate more effectively at the new temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C4">Angilletta, 2009</xref>). Such plastic responses to temperature shifts are referred to as physiological acclimatization, which can be thought of as the organism shifting its performance curve to optimize performance at the new temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C4">Angilletta, 2009</xref>). Acclimatization responses are usually assumed to be adaptive, but they are energetically costly and take time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C22">Deere and Chown, 2006</xref>). Therefore, acclimatization responses are effective only if an organism can expect to be at the new temperature for an extended period of time, or if it can anticipate when the next temperature shift will occur. Thus, the frequency and predictability of temperature variation are likely to determine the effectiveness of acclimatization responses in both free-living and parasitic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C75">Raffel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).Thermal acclimatization responses are potentially important for understanding the effects of temperature variability on infectious disease, because parasites and hosts are likely to have differential responses to temperature variability. For example, metabolic theory predicts that smaller organisms will have faster metabolisms and correspondingly shorter times to complete physiological processes, including thermal acclimatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C69">PÃ¶rtner, 2002</xref>); therefore, parasites, which are almost universally smaller than their hosts, would be expected to acclimatize to new temperatures more rapidly than their hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C75">Raffel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Indeed, it can take weeks for ectothermic vertebrates to acclimatize their immune systems to a new temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C10">Bly and Clem, 1991</xref>), whereas one of the few parasites investigated so far acclimatized to comparable temperature shifts in a matter of hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C90">Terblanche and Chown, 2006</xref>). Therefore, parasites might become more infectious in conditions of frequent and unpredictable shifts in temperature, because of lags in host acclimatization following temperature shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C74">Raffel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). This hypothesis has potentially important implications for responses of hostâ€“parasite systems to climate change, which is altering temperature variability over various time scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C24">Easterling <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C53">Meehl <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C54">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C76">Raisanen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C42">Kunkel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).Hosts can also use plastic responses, such as behaviours, to track temperatures ideally suited for resisting infections, a process called behavioural thermoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C4">Angilletta, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C38">Kearney <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Ectothermic hosts often use behaviour to increase body temperature in response to infectious diseases (â€˜behavioural feverâ€™; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C46">Lefcort and Blaustein, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C92">Thomas and Blanford, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C25">Elliot <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) and might also use behavioural thermoregulation to modulate temporal shifts in temperature (e.g. to move to a relatively warm place if the temperature drops). Spatial variation in temperature can also assist endothermic hosts in responding to pathogens by allowing them to reduce the energetic costs of physiological thermoregulation. For example, bats that gather in warmer parts of caves during winter are better able to survive infection by the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome, because they expend less energy heating their bodies in response to the pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C11">Boyles and Willis, 2010</xref>). Behavioural thermoregulation also poses an empirical challenge, however, because it suggests that coarse-scale temperature projections might sometimes fail to capture the local temperatures experienced by particular hosts or pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C11">Boyles and Willis, 2010</xref>). The extent to which such behavioural effects might diminish the predictive power of models based on coarse-scale temperatures is unclear, however, because large-scale temperature shifts might cause losses of suitable habitat or overwhelm the capacity of organisms to thermoregulate, even in heterogeneous environments. Thus, further study is needed to determine the extent to which behavioural thermoregulation can help hosts mitigate effects of climate shifts on infection.Climate change involves changes to both the mean and the variability of climatic conditions. Here, we discuss evidence in support of the hypothesis that shifts to both temperature means and variances affect hostâ€“parasite interactions and that these altered interactions are facilitating some host population declines. We argue for development of models that integrate the effects of changes to both temperature means and variances on hostâ€“parasite interactions to distribute limited conservation funds effectively.The outcomes of hostâ€“parasite interactions in different constant-temperature conditions in the laboratory are generally straightforward to predict if one has the appropriate physiological temperature-dependent performance curves of the host and the parasite. For instance, if a shift in mean temperature from 10 to 12Â°C causes a greater increase in relevant performance metrics of the parasite relative to the host, then this increase in mean temperature should disproportionately benefit the parasite in this interaction. Indeed, several theoretical, observational, and experimental studies have demonstrated tight linkages between host and parasite performance metrics and changes in mean climatic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C1">Altizer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). For instance, climate has been shown to have particularly strong effects on pathogens with free-living environmental stages (e.g. <italic>Vibrio</italic> spp.) and ectothermic vectors (e.g. <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C66">Pascual <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C62">Paaijmans <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C58">Murdock <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). These types of pathogens often have pronounced inter-annual and seasonal fluctuations that correlate well with changes in temperature or precipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C1">Altizer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C66">Pascual <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), and which can be predicted using climate-based models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C63">Paaijmans <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).Hypothetical diagram showing that increases in parasite infectivity that are approximately linear over a small range of temperatures combined with linear declines in parasite virulence or host susceptibility (potentially caused, for example, by faster host growth out of vulnerable stages of development) can yield non-linear changes to host pathology.Simulated growth curves for a hypothetical pest species at constant temperatures (A) or at variable temperatures (B) with sinusoidal fluctuations of various amplitudes (0Â°C, circles; 5Â°C, diamonds; and 10Â°C, squares).

Phytopathology 84: 1380â€“1384, with permission from The American Phytopathological Society.Non-linear responses of host and/or parasite to temperature can complicate predictions of the effects of climate change on disease risk and thereby threaten conservation efforts. Non-linearities in disease risk arise in at least two ways. First, they arise as a result of integration across generally linear portions of host and parasite temperature performance curves that have opposite slopes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COT022F3">3</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C67">Paull <italic>et al.</italic> (2012)</xref> found a mid-temperature peak in the risk of trematode-induced deformities in the amphibian <italic>Pseudacris regilla</italic>. Fewer deformities at the warmest temperature appear to have been the result of faster host development, and a consequent reduction in the time that hosts spent in early developmental stages where they are vulnerable to deformities. Reduced deformities in the coldest treatment were consistent with an observed decline in parasite infectivity at that temperature. Thus, the combined positive effect of temperature on parasite infectivity and negative effect on host vulnerability may have been responsible for the observed non-linear temperatureâ€“disease risk function in this system (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COT022F3">3</xref>). These trematode infections have been associated with mass malformations and reduced survival in amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C36">Johnson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), again illustrating the conservation importance of integrating the non-linear physiological responses of both host and parasite to temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C83">Rohr <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C57">Mordecai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).Non-linearities can also arise if host, vector, and/or parasite performances across temperature are inherently non-linear, as was shown for the amphibian chytrid fungus, <italic>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C75">Raffel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), which has been implicated in hundreds of amphibian extinctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C89">Stuart <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C94">Wake and Vredenburg, 2008</xref>), and the performance of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. and their vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C62">Paaijmans et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C63">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C64">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C57">Mordecai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). While the studies on <italic>Plasmodium</italic> focused on human malaria, similar patterns are likely to hold for the ecologically similar avian malaria, which has been implicated in extinctions of several Hawaiian birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C93">Vanriper <italic>et al.</italic>, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C28">Garamszegi, 2011</xref>). Importantly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C57">Mordecai <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref> showed that the incorporation of empirically demonstrated non-linearities in parasite development and mosquito performance (e.g. development, reproduction, survival, and bite rate) into a model of malaria transmission yielded an optimal transmission temperature of 25Â°C, which is considerably lower than the 31Â°C predicted by previous studies. Given the role of malaria in the declines of bird species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C93">Vanriper <italic>et al.</italic>, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C28">Garamszegi, 2011</xref>), this example illustrates how non-linearities might affect predictions for how climate change will affect disease risk for hosts of conservation concern.Temperature variability might also influence the outcome of hostâ€“parasite interactions through differences in the acclimatization rates of hosts and parasites to shifts in temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C74">Raffel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C75">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C82">Rohr and Raffel, 2010</xref>). Relative to the historical variability to which hosts evolved, global change has modified and is projected to modify climate variability, including changes to monthly variability, diurnal temperature range, and the frequency of El NiÃ±o events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C24">Easterling <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C76">Raisanen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C97">Yeh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). These changes to climate could theoretically be detrimental to parasites if their hosts or vectors drop to low density during these periods, if their short lifespans make it difficult to persist through unfavourable weather conditions, or if their free-living stages are sensitive to unfavourable conditions. However, the climate variability hypothesis for disease-related declines posits that increased unpredictable climatic variability and extreme events might provide a temporary advantage to pathogens, because they are smaller (fewer cells and processes) and have faster metabolisms than their hosts, thereby allowing them to acclimatize more quickly following a temperature shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C74">Raffel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C75">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C82">Rohr and Raffel, 2010</xref>).Support for the climate variability hypothesis in driving disease-related declines of amphibians and abalone is growing (Box 2), but several underlying assumptions and the generality of the hypothesis remain to be tested thoroughly (Box 3). Nevertheless, the hypothesis holds great promise for enhancing predictions about how disease risk will be modified by simultaneous changes to both the mean and the variance of climatic conditions and thus how and where conservation efforts related to disease should be targeted. Moreover, most proposed mechanisms for how climate change can generally increase infectious disease are highly controversial, because increases in temperature are expected to cause parasite range shifts rather than expansions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C43">Lafferty, 2009</xref>) and possibly just as many scenarios where optimal temperatures of organisms are exceeded as approached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C83">Rohr <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011a</xref>). The climate variability hypothesis, however, might offer a plausible mechanism by which global climate change could, on average, cause general increases in infectious diseases, because temperature variability is becoming less predictable, acclimatization of physiological parameters (e.g. cold hardiness) to temperature shifts is a widespread phenomenon observed across ectothermic taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C4">Angilletta, 2009</xref>), and all parasites are smaller than their hosts and thus should acclimatize more quickly than hosts to temperature shifts. Consequently, climatic variability and predictability might represent under-appreciated links among climate change, disease, and biodiversity losses.We have argued for the need to model simultaneous changes to climatic means and variances in order to predict hostâ€“parasite interactions accurately, but we have yet to offer paths forward to do so. We propose that there are at least two general paths forward. The first is to develop species-specific, well-parameterized models that are targeted to particular disease systems of interest. This would facilitate the development of highly resolved predictions of value to public health or conservation. However, such an approach is labour intensive. Alternatively or additionally, efforts can be focused on the development of more strategic models that aim to identify general physiological principles for how climate change will affect hostâ€“pathogen interactions. While the benefit of this approach is its generality, it remains unclear how accurate it will be for â€˜on-the-groundâ€™ predictions. Pursuit of both approaches in tandem may ultimately represent the most effective path forward.We submit that the metabolic theory of ecology offers a general modelling framework for predicting how changes to climatic means, variances, and extremes will affect disease risk. The MTE relates an individual organism's metabolic rate (<italic>I</italic>), or its rate of energy uptake and allocation, to its body size (<italic>M</italic>) and the ambient temperature (<italic>T</italic>, in kelvin) using the expression <italic>I</italic>â€…âˆâ€…<italic>M</italic>Â¾e<sup>âˆ’<italic>E</italic>/<italic>kT</italic></sup>, where <italic>E</italic> is the average activation energy of respiration and <italic>k</italic> is Boltzmann's constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C15">Brown <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). For temperature, total metabolism increases exponentially over a â€˜normalâ€™ range of temperatures owing to the influence of temperature on chemical reaction rates (although note that, above a critical threshold temperature, enzymes denature and halt reaction rates). There are also extensions of this theory that predict unimodal effects of temperature on physiological processes, such as the Van't Hoffâ€“Arrhenius and Sharpeâ€“Schoolfield models (see modelling section below; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C31">Hechinger, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C55">MolnÃ¡r <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). For body size, the increase in metabolic rate is allometric (i.e. <italic>M</italic> raised to the Â¾ power rather than unity, which would be isometric). This means that the mass-specific metabolic rate (or <italic>I</italic> divided by <italic>M</italic>) decreases to the âˆ’Â¼ power with increases in body size. Stated another way, larger-bodied organisms expend less energy per unit mass relative to smaller-bodied ones, typically owing to increases in heat retention and metabolic efficiency with size. Owing to the importance of metabolic rate in determining both resource uptake and resource allocation, MTE has successfully predicted life history, demographic patterns, and ecosystem processes in taxa ranging from protists to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C15">Brown <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C71">Price <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).The climate variability hypothesis for disease emergence posits that increased unpredictable climatic variability and extreme events driven by global climate change might provide a temporary advantage to pathogens, because pathogens are almost always smaller than their hosts (fewer cells and processes) and thus have faster metabolisms, possibly allowing them to acclimatize more quickly following a temperature shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C74">Raffel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C75">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C82">Rohr and Raffel, 2010</xref>). Support for the climate variability hypothesis is growing, especially for disease-associated declines of amphibians and abalone. Climate variability was used to explain suboptimal amphibian immunity following particular seasonal shifts in temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C74">Raffel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). This finding subsequently spurred tests of associations between various climatic predictors, including temperature variability, and the last year in which each of &gt;100 species of harlequin frogs in the genus <italic>Atelopus</italic> were observed. Most of these declines are believed to have been caused by infections with the chytrid fungus, <italic>B. dendrobatidis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C44">La Marca <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). After detrending the data to reduce the influence of temporal confounders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C81">Rohr <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), these analyses revealed that mean climate variables were not nearly as strong predictors of the fluctuations in amphibian declines as were variables representing climatic variability, consistent with recent work revealing that diurnal temperature range, a measure of temperature variability, was predictive of regional and global <italic>B. dendrobatidis</italic> abundance on amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C59">Murray <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C84">Rohr <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011b</xref>; Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013). Indeed, factors reflecting temperature variability were the only proximate climate variables that were entirely consistent with the spatiotemporal patterns of declines known to be caused by <italic>B. dendrobatidis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C82">Rohr and Raffel, 2010</xref>). The ultimate drivers of these patterns may very well be global El NiÃ±o events. A path model showed that El NiÃ±o events were associated with greater monthly and daily temperature variability, and this increased variability at these two time scales was associated positively with <italic>Atelopus</italic> declines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C82">Rohr and Raffel, 2010</xref>). Importantly, other pathogens associated with amphibian losses, such as the water mold <italic>Saprolegnia ferax</italic>, are also positively associated with the strength of El NiÃ±o episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C39">Kiesecker <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>).Recent empirical tests of the climate variability hypothesis support field patterns by showing that frogs that experienced an unpredictable temperature shift, especially an unpredictable temperature drop, had both more <italic>B.â€…dendrobatidis</italic> and greater mortality than frogs that experienced a constant temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C75">Raffel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). These findings are consistent with a mathematical model showing how temperature variability should affect hostâ€“parasite interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C75">Raffel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Moreover, drops in temperature were more predictive of <italic>Atelopus</italic> declines than increases in temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C75">Raffel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), consistent with <italic>B. dendrobatidis</italic> outbreaks generally occurring during cool seasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C78">Retallick <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C41">Kriger and Hero, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C40">Kinney <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) and with reports that drops in temperature trigger the release of <italic>B.â€…dendrobatidis</italic> zoospores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C96">Woodhams <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), reduce the ability of amphibians to mount an antimicrobial skin peptide-based immune response, and, instead, induce a more pronounced inflammatory reaction that is associated with higher <italic>B.â€…dendrobatidis</italic> burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C79">Ribas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).Climatic variation also appears to have driven disease-induced declines of intertidal black abalone (<italic>Haliotis cracherodii</italic>) throughout much of southern California (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C8">Ben-Horin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). A rickettsial-like disease that causes a condition known as withering syndrome emerged in the 1980s and was associated with mass mortality. Through a series of field and laboratory experiments, it was shown that, similar to the frogâ€“chytrid system, temperature variability increased the susceptibility of black abalone to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C8">Ben-Horin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Disease expression then occurred once water temperatures exceeded thresholds modulating withering syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C8">Ben-Horin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). These studies on temporal variability in temperature and infections of frogs and abalone emphasize the importance of acclimatization effects for understanding climate-driven declines associated with disease and highlight the importance of physiology for elucidating biodiversity losses and targeting conservation efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C47">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).How often do non-linearities occur in the differential temperature-dependent performance curves of interacting species and what are the shapes of these curves? That is, how often and by how much are our predictions off if we assume linear responses?How important is climatic variability relative to mean temperature and precipitation in dictating the outcome of hostâ€“parasite interactions and conservation physiology?Is the underlying assumption of the temperature variability hypothesis of parasitism, that parasites acclimatize to climatic shifts more quickly than their hosts, generally true? If so, do acclimatization responses scale with size based on the Â¾ power law, as do other metabolic processes? Can we predict the advantage that a parasite has with a given climatic shift simply by knowing the difference in size between host and parasite?Is the acclimatization response general across ectothermic hosts and pathogen species?

Does acclimatization generally affect resistance or tolerance to parasites, or both?Different components of physiology acclimatize at different rates (e.g. immunity vs. metabolic rate); how does this affect predictions for how variability in climatic conditions affects hostâ€“parasite interactions?Can we link actual global climate change to acclimatization effects and, if so, does it offer a general climate-based hypothesis for disease emergence?One of the most exciting potentials for applying the MTE to hostâ€“pathogen interactions involves more deeply exploring the temperature-dependency component of vital rates, which thus far has received surprisingly little attention in disease research. A groundbreaking new study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C55">MolnÃ¡r <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref> linked MTE hostâ€“macroparasite models to understand the â€˜fundamental thermal nicheâ€™ of parasites and how their fitness (e.g. <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>, or the basic reproductive number of parasites) varies with changes in temperature. Using arctic nematodes and their mammalian hosts as their empirical foundation, the authors developed temperature-dependent values for parasite mortality and development rate during their free-living periods (which is when they are infectious to roaming mammals). They then developed a temperature-dependent value of <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>, a focal parameter of epidemiologists and studies of disease dynamics, that accounted for trade-offs between development and mortality expected to occur with changing temperatures (i.e. to identify the net effects). This model offered both general predictions about how infection patterns will shift in different warming scenarios and, when parameterized to the nematode system, specific predictions that corresponded well with available empirical data. It also drew attention to the central importance of identifying the threshold temperatures at which parasite development ceases or mortality occurs; values that are either not measured in many empirical studies or are often presented in an unstandardized way.As an example of how this model could be implemented for a real parasiteâ€“host system, we estimated parameters for temperature dependence of the pathogenic fungus <italic>B. dendrobatidis</italic> growing on a susceptible Cuban treefrog (<italic>Osteopilus septentrionalis</italic>). We calculated low- and high-temperature thresholds (<italic>T</italic><sup><italic>L</italic></sup> and <italic>T</italic><sup><italic>H</italic></sup>) based on estimates of the critical thermal maximum and minimum for <italic>B.â€…dendrobatidis</italic> growth (CT<sub>min</sub>â€…=â€…0Â°C; CT<sub>max</sub>â€…=â€…30Â°C) and Cuban treefrog survival (CT<sub>min</sub>â€…=â€…6.4Â°C; CT<sub>max</sub>â€…=â€…39.0Â°C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C35">John-Alder <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C81">Rohr <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The range of temperatures over which an organism can perform a particular physiological function (e.g. development) is generally narrower than the range over which an organism can survive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C55">MolnÃ¡r <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), so we assumed that <italic>T</italic><sup><italic>L</italic></sup> and <italic>T</italic><sup><italic>H</italic></sup> for infectivity and resistance were 5Â°C higher and lower than CT<sub>min</sub> and CT<sub>max</sub>, respectively <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="equun0011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We estimated <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="equun0012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>â€…=â€…0.78, based on the average growth rate of <italic>B.â€…dendrobatidis</italic> in culture at <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub>â€…=â€…20Â°C, as measured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C68">Piotrowski <italic>et al.</italic> (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C96">Woodhams <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> and analysed for population growth rates by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C81">Rohr <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref>. Model predictions were generated using the program R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C73">R Development Core Team, 2010</xref>). Predicted values for <italic>i</italic><sub><italic>T</italic></sub> and Î»<sub><italic>T</italic></sub> were consistent with published patterns of temperature dependence for this parasite in culture and on Cuban treefrogs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COT022F2">2</xref>A and B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C81">Rohr <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C75">Raffel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).To illustrate the relationship between Î»<sub><italic>T</italic></sub> and <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>T</italic>), we selected arbitrary parameter values of Î²â€²â€…=â€…0.001, Î±â€²â€…=â€…0.2, Î³â€²â€…=â€…0.2, <italic>d</italic>â€…=â€…0.1, and <italic>S</italic>â€…=â€…500 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COT022F2">2</xref>B). This set of parameters predicts that <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>T</italic>) will be &gt;1 for temperatures below 25Â°C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="COT022F2">2</xref>B), consistent with laboratory and field data on frog infections and population declines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C82">Rohr and Raffel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C75">Raffel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Note that this model formulation constrains <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>T</italic>) to be positively related to Î»<sub><italic>T</italic></sub> over the entire range of possible parameter values.Assuming that this relationship holds for parasitic organisms, this formula predicts that parasites should acclimatize faster than hosts, with a host-to-parasite acclimatization-time ratio proportional to the quarter power of the host-to-parasite mass ratio. Whether acclimatization rates actually scale with body size, however, remains to be tested (see above and Box 3). If they do, the size difference between ectothermic hosts and parasites might predict how long parasites have an advantage, given their theoretically faster acclimatization rates.Model predictions for changes in parasite infectivity (continuous red line) and host resistance (dotted blue line) in a changing temperature environment, with temperature shifts between 25 and 10Â°C occurring every 4â€…days (A) or every 32â€…days (B). Arrows indicate the first two time points when temperature shifts occurred (25â€…â†’â€…10 and 10â€…â†’â€…25Â°C). (C) Mean parasite replication rates (Î») over 18â€…000 time steps, for different temperature-shift frequencies ranging from daily shifts to shifts occurring every 50 days. The curve is a smoothing spline (function â€˜smooth.splineâ€™) with a smoothing parameter of 0.5.Importantly, this modelling framework that builds upon the models of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C55">MolnÃ¡r <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref> should facilitate the prediction of the magnitude and direction of a change to disease risk in response to known or predicted changes in both climatic means and variances. This should then improve predictions of climate changeâ€“disease interactions, as well as the effectiveness of conservation measures. However, even in the absence of strong acclimatization effects, the incorporation of temperature variability into disease models remains important, because models that simply extrapolate from mean climate values can provide erroneous predictions compared with those that integrate over realistic temperature ranges (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C57">Mordecai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).Here we argued for greater integration of physiology and disease ecology to provide better understanding of climate- and disease-associated host declines. We recommend the incorporation into predictive mathematical models both non-linear responses to climate and differences in the acclimatization responses of hosts and parasites to climatic shifts, because both have recently been shown to have important consequences for disease dynamics associated with host declines. In particular, rather than simply modelling climatic means, predictive models should move towards capturing changes in climatic variances and extremes, given that these changes are a hallmark of climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C24">Easterling <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C53">Meehl <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C54">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C76">Raisanen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="COT022C42">Kunkel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). The metabolic theory of ecology offers intriguing promise for predicting hostâ€“parasite interactions within an environmental context. Given that parasites are always substantially smaller than their hosts and that body size is a reliable proxy of metabolic rate, the MTE should help to integrate physiological mechanisms and large-scale spatiotemporal processes to enable successful prediction of how changes in climatic means, variances, and extremes will affect hostâ€“parasite interactions. We hope that our mathematical model, based on the integration of metabolic theory and physiological mechanisms, provides the scaffolding to enable more successful prediction of how hostâ€“parasite interactions will respond to changes in climatic means, variances, and extremes. However, the success of these predictive models will depend on addressing many of the outstanding questions regarding the relationships between climate, physiology, and hostâ€“parasite interactions (Box 3). Addressing these pressing knowledge gaps and using this new information to improve climateâ€“disease models should improve the capacity to predict how climate change will affect disease risk for species of conservation concern.This work was supported by grants from the US Department of Agriculture (NRI 2006-01370, 2009-35102-05043 to J.R.R.), the US Environmental Protection Agency (STAR R833835, CAREER 83518801 to J.R.R.), and the National Science Foundation (EF-1241889 to J.R.R., IOS-1121529 to P.T.J.J. and T.R.R.), and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation (to P.T.J.J.).
