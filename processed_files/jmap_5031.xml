Female-limited polymorphism and its significance in Appias (Catophaga) nero corazonae Schröder and Treadaway, 1989 (Lepidoptera: Pieridae)Diagnostic characters are presented for Appias nero corazonae, a pierid butterfly from the Sulu Archipelago, Philippines, that exhibits female-limited polymorphism. The potential significance of A. n. corazonae for genetic investigations into Darwinian transference, the hypothetical process whereby bright colouration first evolves in the males of a species and is later ‘transferred’ to the females, is discussed.
