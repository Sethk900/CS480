Perhaps the most important of such properties in human-modified landscapes is the total amount of remnant native vegetation. In a seminal study Andrén proposed the existence of a fragmentation threshold in the total amount of remnant vegetation, below which landscape-scale connectivity is eroded and local species richness and abundance become dependent on patch size. Despite the fact that species patch-area effects have been a mainstay of conservation science there has yet to be a robust empirical evaluation of this hypothesis. Here we present and test a new conceptual model describing the mechanisms and consequences of biodiversity change in fragmented landscapes, identifying the fragmentation threshold as a first step in a positive feedback mechanism that has the capacity to impair ecological resilience, and drive a regime shift in biodiversity. The model considers that local extinction risk is defined by patch size, and immigration rates by landscape vegetation cover, and that the recovery from local species losses depends upon the landscape species pool. Using a unique dataset on the distribution of non-volant small mammals across replicate landscapes in the Atlantic forest of Brazil, we found strong evidence for our model predictions - that patch-area effects are evident only at intermediate levels of total forest cover, where landscape diversity is still high and opportunities for enhancing biodiversity through local management are greatest. Furthermore, high levels of forest loss can push native biota through an extinction filter, and result in the abrupt, landscape-wide loss of forest-specialist taxa, ecological resilience and management effectiveness. The proposed model links hitherto distinct theoretical approaches within a single framework, providing a powerful tool for analysing the potential effectiveness of management interventions.Here we expand Andrén's hypothesis, and propose that the fragmentation threshold represents a first step in a positive feedback mechanism that has the capacity to severely impair ecological resilience, and drive a potentially irreversible regime shift in biodiversity of fragmented landscapes. We present a new conceptual model that makes explicit the key variables and feedbacks governing such a shift, taking into account the interaction between native vegetation cover at patch and landscape scales, and between alpha (patch) and gamma (landscape) diversity. The model considers that: (1) population sizes and local extinction risk are determined by patch size, while immigration rates are determined by landscape-scale vegetation cover, and (2) the capacity to recover from local species losses (reduction in alpha diversity) is dependent on the total landscape species pool (gamma diversity). From the model, we derive general predictions of how species abundance and diversity patterns at different spatial scales should change along a gradient of native vegetation loss, and test these predictions using a dataset on the distribution of non-volant small mammals across replicate landscapes in the Atlantic forest of Brazil.Our results were consistent with the proposed model. The species-area relationship among forest patches was strongly dependent upon the total amount of remaining forest and was only observed at an intermediate level of forest cover (where gamma diversity was high but alpha diversity was dependent on patch size). At a high level of forest cover both gamma and alpha diversity were high, whereas a low level of forest cover was associated with a homogeneously low alpha diversity, and thus an abrupt drop in gamma diversity and associated ecological resilience. The regime-shift model presented here provides a powerful analytical and diagnostic framework for understanding the potential effectiveness of management interventions, and guiding the investment of limited conservation resources in human-modified ecosystems.i. Schematic representation of the distribution of native vegetation patches and landscape immigration rates (proportionate to width of arrows). ii. Expected relationship between patch size and richness or abundance (per unit of area) of specialist (solid line) and generalist (dotted line) species. iii. Expected relationship between both the effectiveness of local management (solid line) and ecological resilience of native biota (dotted line) to landscape-wide native vegetation loss.Sketches represent the relationships between even-effort samples of total abundance or species richness (y axis) and patch area (x axis) in different landscapes (lines). By definition generalist species should not respond (A) or respond positively (C) to the loss of native vegetation. The simple patch-area effect model predicts that the abundance and richness of forest specialists increase with patch area, irrespective of landscape context (B). Alternatively, the amount of native vegetation at the landscape scale may determine the abundance and richness of forest specialists regardless of (C) or in combination with patch area (D). Finally, specialist species may respond to patch area only above a certain threshold of native vegetation loss at the landscape scale (E), or only at intermediate levels of native vegetation loss, above which individual patches (regardless of size) cannot support viable populations (F). For both D and E, the strength of the patch-area effect may depend upon landscape context.The Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small samples (AICc) was calculated for each model from their log-likelihoods, number of parameters and sample sizes, and the model with the lowest AICc was considered the most plausible. The plausibility of alternative models were estimated by the differences in their AICc values in relation to the AICc of the most plausible model (ΔAIC), where a value of ΔAIC &lt;2 indicates equally plausible models. The Akaike weights (wi) express the relative likelihood of each model, in a scale of 0 to 1.Mean and 95% confidence intervals are presented.
