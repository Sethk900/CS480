Cohort effects in red squirrels: the influence of density, food abundance and temperature on future survival and reproductive success.<ol><li>Environmental conditions experienced early in life may have long-lasting effects on individual performance, thereby creating 'silver-spoon effects'.</li><li>We used 15 years of data from a North American red squirrel (<em>Tamiasciurus hudsonicus</em> Erxleben) population to investigate influences of food availability, density and spring temperature experienced early in life on reproduction and survival of female squirrels during adulthood.</li><li>We found that spring temperature and food availability did not affect female survival after 1 year of age, whereas higher squirrel densities led to lower survival, thereby affecting longevity and lifetime fitness.</li><li>In addition, both food availability experienced between birth and weaning, and spring temperature in the year of birth, had long-lasting positive effects on female reproductive success. These results emphasize the critical effect environmental conditions during the early life stages can have on the lifetime performance of small mammals.</li><li>These long-term effects of early food and temperature were apparent only once we controlled for conditions experienced during adulthood. This suggests that silver-spoon effects can be masked when conditions experienced early in life are correlated to some environmental conditions experienced later in life.</li><li>The general importance of silver-spoon effects for adult demographic performance might therefore be underestimated, and taking adult environment into account appears to be necessary when studying long-term cohort effects.</li></ol>
