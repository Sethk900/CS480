Review of the New Caledonian species of Acritoptila Wells, 1982 (Trichoptera, Insecta), with descriptions of 3 new speciesAbstract We review the New Caledonian representatives of the Australasian endemic hydroptiline genus Acritoptila, based on examination of a considerable collection of material in the Swedish Museum of Natural History and of types of previously established species. A key for identification of males is given and includes 3 species newly described here: A. parallela sp. n., A. forficata sp. n. and A. macrospina sp. n. For all New Caledonian species, male genitalia are illustrated, and for 5 associated females, distinctive features are illustrated and described.
