Using Automated Digital Recording Systems as Effective Tools for the Monitoring of Birds and AmphibiansThere is a need to improve the quantity and quality of data in biodiversity monitoring projects. We compared an automated digital recording system (ADRS) with traditional methods (point-counts and transects) for the assessment of birds and amphibians. The ADRS proved to produce better quantity and quality of data. This new method has 3 additional advantages: permanent record of a census, 24 h/d data collection and the possibility of automated species identification.
