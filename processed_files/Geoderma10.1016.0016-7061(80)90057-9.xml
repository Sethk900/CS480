Geoderma, 24 : 299--307.    Background levels of some minor elements in 173 samples (53 soils) widely dispersed  in Canada are summarized and discussed in relation to data for other soils in Canada and  elsewhere. Mean levels (ppm) for the 173 samples are: Cr 43, Mn 520, Co 21, Ni 20, Cu  22, Zn 74, Se 0.3, Sr 210, Hg 0.06 and Pb 20. These are similar to means reported for  soils of the United States and, with some exceptions, for world soils. Levels of several of  the elements studied differed significantly among physiographic regions.  The Ae (eluvial) horizons of Podzolic, Gleysolic and Luvisolic soils were markedly de-  pleted, relative to the associated C horizons, of Mn, Co, Ni, Cu ; depletion of Cr, Zn, Pb  and Sr was less striking.  Though levels of some minor elements are significantly correlated with other soil prop-  erties such as clay, organic C, Fe, etc., predictability of the levels of most minor ele-  ments from other soil properties is not good. One notable exception is that Sr in non-  calcareous samples can be estimated from Ca.    INTRODUCTION    Levels of minor elements in uncontaminated soils remote from orebodies  (background levels) are of interest for several reasons: such data are one  aspect of the basic characterization of soft; minor elements are part of the  nutritional chain from soil to plants to animals (including man); data on  background levels are essential to' an assessment of the degree of soil contam-  ination with minor elements from industrial and urban wastes.  The purposes of this paper are to present the current information on back-  ground levels (totals) of several minor elements in Canadian mineral soils,  and to indicate relationships between soil genesis and levels of elements in  various horizons of uncultivated soils. Some general relationships are indi-    *LRRI Contribution no. 42; ESRI Contribution no.

MATERIALS AND METHODS    Soils    The samples of uncultivated softs were available from previous studies of  soil classification and genesis. McKeague et al. (1979) reported location,  classification, sampling depth and other information. The widespread distri-  bution (Fig. 1) and nature (Table I) of the softs are shown. Samples of the  air-dry material that passed a 2-mm sieve were ground to pass a 300-mesh  (47 pm) sieve. Between 1 and 5 samples were analyzed of each soil; the  maximum would include Ah, Ae, upper B, lower B and C horizons; the  minimum was one C horizon of a Regosolic soft. A total of 173 samples from  53 soils were analyzed and reference soil samples were used as checks.    $  I  3         ,~                                        ~ ~    o            778.  ~                              2f          ' "    "   57~    Fig. 1.

Co  O    302    Chemical analysis    Minor elements, except Se, were determined by acid dissolution of the  samples and atomic absorption; Se was determined fluorimetrically  (L~vesque and Vendette, 1971). Details of the methods were reported by  McKeague et al. (1979). Results are reported on the basis of oven-dry  (110) soil weight.    RESULTS    The range (Table II) is based on all published data for Canadian soils as  summarized by McKeague et al. (1979). Commonly the mean is below the  midpoint of the range, indicating a somewhat skewed distribution. Data for  some softs close to orebodies, for contaminated soils, and for a few unusual  samples are not included. Examples of the latter are an apparently uncon-  taminated soil with a mercury level of 14 ppm (McKeague and Kloosterman,  1974) and a placic horizon with 15% Mn (McKeague et al., 1968). The mean  values for soils of the United States are those of Shacklette et al. (197ta, b)  for the 200-mesh (&lt;75 #m) fraction of 863 subsurface soil samples. Values  for world soils from Aubert and Pinta (1977) are "ranges of average means".

All elements were determined in all samples with the following exceptions:  Se in Appalachian, 37 values; Hg in Appalachian, 33 values; Hg in St. Lawrence Low-  lands, 32 values; Hg in Interior Plains, 25 values.  ,3 Standard error of the mean based upon the minimum no. of observations in the row (12).    icantly (5% level) among regions (Table III). Thus, for example, samples  from the Cordilleran ~egion had higher levels of Cr, Co and Ni than samples  from other regions and samples from the Appalachian region had significant-  ly less Sr than those from other regions. The limited number of samples from  each region (Fig. 1) must be considered before extrapolating these trends.  Levels of most minor elements were significantly correlated with levels of  other elements or other soil properties such as clay (Table IV). For random  samples from normally distributed populations, a correlation coefficient of  0.3 is significant at the 1% level if there are more than 70 observations (Steel  and Torrie, 1960). Subject to that condition, all of the correlations reported  in Table IV are highly significant. Correlation coefficients between Hg and  other variables were all below 0.3; those for Zn and Pb were only slightly  higher. On the other hand, correlation coefficients for Co, Ni, Cr and Sr with  some of the other variables exceeded 0.6.  Stepwise linear regression analysis was used to test the feasibility of esti-  mating minor element levels from other soil properties. Equations for most  of the elements accounted for less than half of the variability. Much of the  variability of Co and Ni, however, was accounted for by non-carbonate Mg in  some groups of samples and, with data for 23 calcareous samples removed,  Sr was predictable from Ca data (McKeague and Wolynetz, 1979). For the  23 calcareous samples, the correlation between Sr and Ca was only 0.31.    304  TABLE IV  Correlation coefficients between minor element levels and levels of other soil proper-  ties* 1    Org.

Levels of most minor elements determined were depleted in Ae horizons  compared to the associated B and C horizons (Table V); the two exceptions  were Se and Hg. The depletion of the Ae horizons of Podzolic and Gleysolic  soils are about equal and perhaps slightly greater for several elements than  that of the Ae horizons of the Luvisolic soils studied. In general, the B hori-  zons of Podzolic and Gleysolic soils are somewhat depleted of minor ele-  ments relative to the associated C horizons; exceptions to this are Se and Hg.  The B horizons of Luvisolic soils, on the other hand, tend to be enriched  relative to the associated C horizons.  For the five pedons having Ah, B, C sequences, on the other hand, the A  and B horizons were either enriched or only slightly depleted of the elements  studied relative to the C horizon (Table VI).

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS    Mean minor element levels reported for Canadian softs are similar to levels  of Shacklette et al. (1971a, b) for the less than 75 pm fraction of subsurface  soil samples from the United States. Many are similar also to estimated  means for world soils but there are some notable differences. For example,  our mean values for Cr is 45 ppm; Vinogradov (1959) estimated 200 ppm. In  the case of Se, our mean value of 0.30 ppm is 30 times that estimated by  Vinogradov. World means for some elements probably differ from Canadian  means because our soils are only slightly weathered relative to soils devel-  oped in ancient materials. Another factor that might account for some of the  differences in estimated means is the fact that Vinogradov's estimates were    306    made many years ago. Current instrumentation and methodology presum-  ably facilitate more accurate determination of trace constituents of soils.  For a few elements, the concentration in a given soil sample can be esti-  mated from other data for that sample. The best example of this is the esti-  mation of Sr from non-carbonate Ca (McKeague and Wolynetz, 1979).  Estimates of Co and Ni from Mg and Fe data are reasonably good for some  regions. However, overall success at estimating levels of a given element from  other properties of the same sample was limited. Such estimates are of only  minor practical significance because the task of dissolving the soil sample is  more time consuming than that of determining an additional element or two  by atomic absorption.  The striking depletion of several elements in Ae horizons demonstrates the  significance of soil morphology in studies of soil geochemistry. If the soils  had been sampled by standard depth increments, this relationship would not  have emerged. Leaching of minor elements from Ae horizons of Podzolic  soils in Canada was documented years ago by Wright et al. (1955) and  Presant (1971). A striking feature of the data presented herein is the indica-  tion that the Ae horizons of Gleysolic soils are as strongly depleted as those  of Podzolic soils. This may indicate that periodic reducing conditions with  leaching may be as effective as organic complexing of metals and leaching in  the translocation of minor elements in soils.

AbstractBackground levels of some minor elements in 173 samples (53 soils) widely dispersed in Canada are summarized and discussed in relation to data for other soils in Canada and elsewhere. Mean levels (ppm) for the 173 samples are: Cr 43, Mn 520, Co 21, Ni 20, Cu 22, Zn 74, Se 0.3, Sr 210, Hg 0.06 and Pb 20. These are similar to means reported for soils of the United States and, with some exceptions, for world soils. Levels of several of the elements studied differed significantly among physiographic regions.The Ae (eluvial) horizons of Podzolic, Gleysolic and Luvisolic soils were markedly depleted, relative to the associated C horizons, of Mn, Co, Ni, Cu; depletion of Cr, Zn, Pb and Sr was less striking.Though levels of some minor elements are significantly correlated with other soil properties such as clay, organic C, Fe, etc., predictability of the levels of most minor elements from other soil properties is not good. One notable exception is that Sr in noncalcareous samples can be estimated from Ca.
