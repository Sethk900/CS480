Partitioning of vocal activity in a Neotropical highland-frog communityVocal activity was studied in a Colombian highland-frog community, consisting of five frog species belonging to three families with three different reproductive modes, which reproduced simultaneously in the area. We encountered one diurnal and four nocturnal species. Each species had a distinct call structure, and the 24-hour patterns of calling activity differed significantly between all but two species. Interspecific differences in dominant call frequencies corresponded inversely to differences in male snout-vent length. Only one species called in ponds, whereas all other species used terrestrial sites. Among the terrestrial callers there seemed to be interspecific differences in plant use as calling sites. Our results indicate that despite the low number of species, interspecific vocal partitioning is pronounced, and probably important for reliable vocal communication.
