Publications are an accepted measure of research output, and network models can describe the collaborative nature of publication. In particular, ecological networks can serve as analogies for publication and technology adoption. We constructed network models of adoption of bioinformatics programming languages and health IT (HIT) from the literature.We selected seven programming languages and four types of HIT. We performed PubMed searches to identify publications since 2001. We calculated summary statistics and analyzed spatiotemporal relationships. Then, we assessed ecological models of specialization, cooperativity, competition, evolution, biodiversity, and stability associated with publications.Adoption of HIT has been variable, while scripting languages have experienced rapid adoption. Hospital systems had the largest HIT research corpus, while Perl had the largest language corpus. Scripting languages represented the largest connected network components. The relationship between edges and nodes was linear, though Bioconductor had more edges than expected and Perl had fewer. Spatiotemporal relationships were weak. Most languages shared a bioinformatics specialization and appeared mutualistic or competitive. HIT specializations varied. Specialization was highest for Bioconductor and radiology systems. Specialization and cooperativity were positively correlated among languages but negatively correlated among HIT. Rates of language evolution were similar. Biodiversity among languages grew in the first half of the decade and stabilized, while diversity among HIT was variable but flat. Compared with publications in 2001, correlation with publications one year later was positive while correlation after ten years was weak and negative.Adoption of new technologies can be unpredictable. Spatiotemporal relationships facilitate adoption but are not sufficient. As with ecosystems, dense, mutualistic, specialized co-habitation is associated with faster growth. There are rapidly changing trends in external technological and macroeconomic influences. We propose that a better understanding of how technologies are adopted can facilitate their development.We then calculated the geographical distribution of publications to generate statistics and maps, the latter as a means of investigating spatial networks. From the MEDLINE files, we tabulated frequencies of the country of origin for published studies. We color-coded countries according to which technology was most commonly published. Using the frequency data, we generated maps to display the extent to which technology adoption was influenced by geography.The literature search identified 2416 total publications. Among HIT, we identified 418 for HIS, 226 for RS, 153 for LIS, and 133 for RIS. Among programming languages, we identified 443 for Perl, 255 for Bioconductor, 244 for Python, 197 for Visual Basic, 166 for Fortran, 95 for Javascript, and 86 for Mathematica. Publication attributes were always reported, except place (PL) which ranged in reporting frequency from 93% (Python) to 99% (four technologies).Line graphs of the number of PubMed results for each HIT over time, (A) each year and (B) cumulatively. The number of publications on hospital information systems began to grow rapidly in the early part of the decade but has been variable. Overall, there are nearly twice as many HIS publications versus other HIT. (C, D) Corresponding graphs for programming languages. The number of publications using Perl grew rapidly in the early part of the decade and then stabilized, while the number of publications using Bioconductor and Python has grown more recently. Overall, Perl enjoys a nearly two-fold lead in total publications versus other languages.(A) Barchart displays country-of-origin frequencies. Among HIT, the United States publishes more frequently on RIS then does England. (B) World map shows countries of origin for publication. We color-coded countries according to the most commonly published technology. Mathematica, JavaScript, and Fortran did not meet this criteria for any country. Bioconductor is shown in light green, Visual Basic in light blue, Python in aqua, Perl in yellow, RS in orange, RIS in dark blue, LIS in dark green, and HIS in red. The map displays expected clusters in North America, Europe, East Asia, and Asia-Pacific.Published studies are depicted as nodes and common authors as edges. (A) Network colored by technology, languages in red, HIT in green. The largest connected components represent programming languages, specifically Bioconductor, Perl, and Python. The largest component representing HIT is related to HIS. There is only major hybrid component. (B) The relationship between edges and nodes is linear, though Bioconductor has more edges than expected and Perl has fewer. (C, D) Larger nodes are more recent. Nodes of similar time periods tend to be neighbors, though this is less frequently true among more mature languages. Distinct topical clusters are highlighted and described in the text.(A) Barchart displays specialization measured as the fraction of PubMed results for each technology published in the most common journal, and cooperativity as the number of authors per publication. Among languages, all were specialized in the field of bioinformatics except Fortran. Bioconductor was most specialized, while Visual Basic was least specialized. Among HIT, RIS was most specialized while RS were least specialized. Cooperativity between languages and HIT were comparable. Among languages, specialization and cooperativity were positively correlated, while among HIT they were negatively correlated. (B) Time-to-event curves depict rates of evolution, as measured by time to version releases for languages. Perl's early evolution was slower but then accelerated. Plots of specialization and cooperativity versus (C) network edges and (D) nodes. P-values of linear fits are (C) 0.11 and 0.07, (D) 0.06 and 0.04.(A) Biodiversity is estimated using entropy calculations, indicating that diversity among languages grew in the first half of the decade and stabilized, while diversity among HIT has been variable but flat. (B) Stability was estimated by comparing the number of publications for each language in 2010 and 2002 versus 2001 to indicate short- and long-term stability. One-year correlation was positive but not statistically significant; ten-year correlation was negative and weak. Relationships between one-year and three-year stability with biodiversity were (C) negatively correlated for HIT (pâ€Š=â€Š0.46, 0.38) and (D) positively correlated for programming languages (pâ€Š=â€Š0.02, pâ€Š=â€Š0.15).In this study, we calculated statistics, constructed network models for analysis and visualization, and described ecological characteristics of biomedical IT adoption, specifically programming languages used in bioinformatics and health IT systems, based on the literature from the last decade. Adoption of HIT has been variable, while scripting languages have experienced rapid adoption. We found that, as with biological species, dense, mutualistic co-habitation is associated with faster growth. We propose that understanding why and how technologies are adopted could aid in their development and lead to scientific and socioeconomic benefit.In this study, a world map shows countries of origin for publications and displays expected clusters in North America, Europe, East Asia, and Asia-Pacific. Within types of technology, there is considerable variation in the relative fractions of publication frequencies. There was little geographical correlation, further supporting the hypothesis that technology adoption is a virtual process.Our network diagrams of studies as nodes and common authors as edges show the largest connected components represent modern scripting languages. Temporal network diagrams showed that nodes of similar time periods tend to be neighbors, though this is less frequently true among more mature languages. The two largest connected components among HIT represent HIS, and two of the next three biggest components represent LIS. Among programming languages, the largest connected component represents Bioconductor. The next largest, which surprisingly is also the only hybrid component, represents Perl and Python. Interestingly, based on a linear model, Bioconductor has more edges than expected and Perl has fewer, perhaps due to Bioconductor's high specialization and cooperativity and Perl's slower initial evolution. For Bioconductor and Perl, the largest connected components include well-defined topical clusters.At the level of individual technologies, several ecological models can be useful to describe research collaboration: (1) we assessed specialization as the fraction of publications per technology occurring in a single journal; (2) we assessed mutualism and competition based on technologies published in similar journals; (3) we calculated cooperativity as the number of authors per publication; (4) and finally, for languages, we assessed evolution as the progression of time-to-event for new version releases.The range of IT methodologies, applications, and--more than ever--interactions in biomedical research and clinical practice has become extraordinarily complex. The cost and effort of implementing new technologies as well as the potential missed opportunities, in terms of scientific productivity and patient care, due to unsuccessful implementations demand that IT systems become better understood. Because peer-reviewed publications are a widely accepted and comprehensive permanent record of biomedical research, they present an invaluable resource for inquiry. However, as complex as IT and the research literature have become, traditional methods for analyzing and interpreting the data may no longer suffice. Networks are becoming increasingly appreciated for their ability to model complex social systems such as research co-authorship. Recently, network models have also been applied successfully to analyze ecological systems, but just as importantly, the behaviors of ecological systems have provided insights into the structure of network models. In the cases of both abstract networks and real world social and ecological systems, emergent behaviors arising from populations of individuals may be different than the simple sum of their parts.We built this study on several key premises: first, that the biomedical literature could be used as a detailed and comprehensive description of technology adoption; second, that network models could be applied to understand the complex topology of IT publications; and third, that ecological models could further inform and enable interpretation of technology adoption and publication networks. There were many possible ways to conduct this analysis. We chose to model a publication as an organism in a population, where publications related to different types of technologies were analogous to organisms of different species. These publications, regardless of technology discussed, formed relationships based on shared authorship just as organisms might form relationships with other organisms of the same or different species. An implicit assumption is that publications and organisms are independent and can â€œtake on a life of their ownâ€. Groups of publications subsequently formed niches, often within the same or similar journals, just as groups of organisms might form a niche in a lake or a cave. These behaviors could be measured using abstract bibliometric network statistics such as co-authorship and density as well as ecological metrics such as specialization and cooperatively. As these niches combined to form â€œecosystemsâ€, in this case programming languages or HIT, emergent properties were observed related to system diversity and stability that are being studied with great interest in real-world deserts, oceans, and cities.In this study, we performed statistical analyses and constructed ecological models of information technology adoption based on the biomedical literature. We focused on programming languages used in bioinformatics research and health IT systems implemented in clinical settings. Adoption of HIT has been variable, while scripting languages have experienced rapid adoption and have grown to form large connected network components. We found that spatiotemporal relationships can facilitate adoption but are not sufficient. Dense, mutualistic â€œecosystemsâ€ are associated with faster technology adoption. We propose that a better understanding of which technologies get adopted, as well as how and why, can potentially facilitate their design and distribution as well as lead to socioeconomic benefits such as intellectual property production and employment opportunities.(PPT)(PPT)(PPT)(PPT)(PPT)(PPT)I thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.
