Coyote capture vulnerability relative to space use and trap densityCoyotes (Canis latrans) are reported to be less vulnerable to capture in familiar areas of territories, however, most studies do not control for trap density across the territory. We determined if accounting for trap density provided a better explanation of observed capture rates. Based on a sample of 24 captured coyotes (6 inside core areas and 18 on peripheries of occupied areas) the best fitting model describing capture location only accounted for trap density and not relative time spent in each region. Our results suggest that coyote capture rates are a function of trap density in an area and not novelty avoidance. Placing traps in core areas of territories can increase the probability of capturing individuals from specific territories to increase the effectiveness of management or research activities.
