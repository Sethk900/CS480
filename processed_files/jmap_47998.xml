Falcidens targatus and F. acutargatus: two species of Caudofoveata (Mollusca, Aplacophora) new for BrazilTwo species of Falcidens Salvini-Plawen, 1968 (Chaetodermatidae) are recorded for the first time from Campos Basin, off south-eastern Brazil. Seventeen samples with 176 specimens of Falcidens targatus Salvini-Plawen, 1992 were collected from the continental shelf, and 141 individuals of Falcidens acutargatus Salvini-Plawen, 1992 were obtained in 53 samples from the slope. They are recognized by their external morphology and by the details of their sclerites, radula and oral shield; further, new morphometrical data are added. Type material was also examined. As for both these species the former subgenus name Lepoderma Salvini-Plawen, 1992 is a pre-occupied name by Lepoderma Looss, 1899 (Trematoda), the new subgenus name Chiastofalcidens is proposed to replace it. The finding of F. (Ch.) acutargatus from off Rio de Janeiro suggests that this species has a continuous distribution in the slope through all the Western Atlantic. In contrast, F. (Ch.) targatus appears to be more restricted in its distribution.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:7E79F655-8468-4113-AA2D-95FDCF0CF5EA
