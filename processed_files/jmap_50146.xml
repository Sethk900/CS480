Threat status and distribution of the endemic species Allolobophora kosowensis kosowensis Karaman, 1968 (Oligochaeta: Lumbricidae) in the BalkansAllolobophora kosowensis kosowensis Karaman, 1968 is an earthworm species exclusively endemic to the state of Serbia. Although it was described almost half a century ago, there are fewer than 20 known locations. The aim of this paper is to present the data from our own collecting and, by analysing the whole list of records, to trace a synthetic outline of the distribution and threat status of A. kosowensis kosowensis in the Balkans. Despite intensive faunistic investigations in Serbia, it was only registered in the Vojvodina Province 5 years ago. Nevertheless, this represents a considerable range extension for A. kosowensis kosowensis, defining at the same time the northernmost point of its occurrence in the Balkans. The analysis based on the IUCN 2011 Red List Categories shows that A. kosowensis kosowensis has an Endangered status (B2b (ii, iii, iv, v) c (ii, iii, iv, iv)) in the Balkans.
