Camera traps reveal use of caves by Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus gedrosianus) (Mammalia: Ursidae) in southeastern IranThe Baluchistan region of Iran and Pakistan is inhabited by one of the most threatened populations of Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus gedrosianus) in Asia. The first camera-trapping survey of these so-called Baluchistan bears was conducted in Bahr-e Asman Mountain, southeastern Iran. Fourteen camera traps were installed in the entrances of caves from April to December, 2009. A total of 32 bear photographs were obtained from three caves. Data analysis of photographs showed the presence of at least seven different individuals: two lone bears, and two family groups, with one and two cubs. Despite being very marginal habitat, affected both by human use and drought, the area supports a reproducing population of bears. This study suggests that caves may be important in the life history of these bears, and should be protected for their conservation.
