Effective Approach for Solving Battle of Water Calibration Network ProblemAbstractThis paper presents an effective approach for calibrating an extended period simulation (EPS) model of water distribution system. By using the benchmark model calibration problem, set up for Battle of Water Calibration Networks (BWCN), the EPS model calibration is solved in a progressive manner, optimizing model parameters and engineering judgments. The model calibration approach consists of multiple steps, including: (1) constructing the initial EPS model with the given system and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data, (2) calibrating pipe properties and pump curves for static and fire flow test data, and (3) calibrating EPS model demands and controls for given SCADA data over 167 h. The calibration was iteratively conducted per district meter area (DMA) and then fine-tuned for the whole system. Although the field data contained some noise, good model calibration was achieved for BWCN. By using the practically measurable hydraulic attributes of pump flows, pressures, and tank levels provided for BWCN, the performance of the calibrated model is compared with those calibrated by 14 teams around the world participating in the BWCN.
