Soil respiration in a bamboo forest as affected by soil temperatures and soil moisture contentsThe growth rate of bamboo plants is considered to be greater than other tree species and thus it will be promising plants for afforestation. Bamboo plants have the role as a CO2 absorber, if the bamboo forests can be well managed. In order to understand CO2 absorption ability of the bamboo forests, it is important to know the characteristics of CO2 exchange of the underground parts of bamboos as well as the aerial parts. In the present study, we examined soil respiration (CO2 efflux from soil surface) in bamboo forests as affected by soil temperatures and soil moisture contents. The soil respiration rate was measured by a chamber method in the bamboo forest consisted of Phyllostachys pubescens throughout one year. The soil respiration rate was greater at the measurement sites nearer the bamboo stems. The mean soil respiration rates were 10, 23, 13 and 4 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in April, August, October and December, respectively. The soil respiration rate increased with increase of the soil temperature. Because the rate in the bamboo forest was greater than that in other temperate forests, the respiration rate of the underground parts of bamboos seemed to be greater than that of other tree species. There was no significant effect of the soil moisture content on the soil respiration rate in a range of 25-40 % volume water contents in April, October and December, although the soil respiration rate tended to decrease with increase of the soil moisture contents in August.
