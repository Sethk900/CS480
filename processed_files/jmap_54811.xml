Effects of fire on soil organic matter in a â€œcerrado sensu-strictoâ€ from Southeast Brazil as revealed by changes in Î´13CWe studied the effect of increasing fire incidence on litter and soil organic matter in a Dark Red Latosol (Typic Haplustox) under a â€œcerrado sensu-strictoâ€ vegetation in Southeast Brazil. After 21 years, C4-grass population significantly increased in the plot under high fire incidence (â€œcerrado 3â€) compared to the plots of low fire incidence (â€œcerrado 1â€ and â€œcerrado 2â€). In general, the variability of organic carbon (OC) content, organic nitrogen (ON) content and Î´13C, both in litter and in the topsoil, was higher in â€œcerrado 3â€ than in the other plots. The higher fire incidence in â€œcerrado 3â€ decreased the litter stock of carbon and nitrogen by 3703Â±930 and 104Â±26 kg haâˆ’1, respectively, in relation to the other plots. However, no difference in carbon (195.0Â±8.2 Mg haâˆ’1) and nitrogen (13.4Â±1.0 Mg haâˆ’1) stock in the first meter of soil was observed between the plots. The values of Î´13C increased between 2.06â€° and 3.39â€° under C3 plants, and decreased 8.31â€° under C4 plants from litter to topsoil. For all plots, the Î´13C profile showed an increase in Î´13C with depth. In â€œcerrado 1â€ and â€œcerrado 2â€, the Î´13C values ranged from âˆ’25.80â€° to âˆ’23.19â€°, typical for a C3-dominated vegetation profile. In â€œcerrado 3â€, the replacement of C3- by C4-derived C was in average 34.6% throughout the profile. We conclude that: (i) the studied undisturbed â€œcerrado sensu-strictoâ€ is a C3-dominated vegetation; (ii) biannual fire incidence for 21 years reduced the C3 dominance and decreased the stock of C and N in litter, but not in the soil; (iii) in the same period, at least about one-third of the C stock in the soil, or 67.5 Mg haâˆ’1 (to 1-m depth), was replaced by C4-derived below ground litter; and (iv) in choosing a Î´13C reference profile for soils under cerrado, it is necessary to take fire incidence into account.
