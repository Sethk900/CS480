The soil mite family Galumnidae of Iran (Acari: Oribatida)Although a few species have been recorded in Iran, many species from the family Galumnidae remained undiscovered, and in this work we describe six new species and redescribe one known species from the northern part of the country. They are Acrogalumna lanceolata sp. nov., Allogalumna dentirostrata sp. nov., Galumna granulimorpha sp. nov., Galumna triangulata sp. nov., Galumna iranensis Mahunka et Akrami, 2001, Pergalumna iunctiporosa sp. nov., Pergalumna microtuberculata sp. nov., and the description of each species is accompanied with detailed illustrations. We also present data on habitat and biogeography of Iranian species of Galumnidae, and a key is provided for identification of all recorded species in this country.http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:D31C04EF-57C0-4D3F-9F06-0389EB618409
