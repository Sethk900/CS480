Mobility of Cr, Pb, Cd, Cu and Zn in a loamy sand soil: A comparative studyInterest in soil contamination has been growing in recent years due to the ongoing degradation of soil environments. Therefore, the development of remediation techniques and the study of contaminant sorption and migration are areas of intense research.  In this study, the authors sought to evaluate the scenario of co-contamination of a loamy sand soil by multiple heavy metals. To that end, the sorption and transport of five metals—Cr, Pb, Cd, Cu and Zn—was evaluated using representative samples of a soil from the north of Portugal. The tests were conducted in batch and continuous systems using single- and multiple-metal acid solutions to evaluate the effect of metal competition. In accordance with the type of assay—batch or continuous—Langmuir or Convection Dispersion Two-Site Nonequilibrium models were adjusted to explain the sorption/transport data. FTIR analyses were performed on the final samples of the continuous systems.  Generally, the results revealed good fitting of the tested models for the metals in competitive and noncompetitive scenarios, with the exception of Zn that was originally present in soil samples at higher concentrations. As expected, the influence of competition was observed in both batch and continuous systems, but with different tendencies. The FTIR spectra also revealed a strong influence of clay minerals and organic matter on the sorption of the metals.
