Several studies have investigated the role trichomes play in protecting plant organs in these conditions. In this work we report an unusual way of protecting the stem apex of <italic>Lychnophora diamantinana</italic>. The terminal cell of its non-glandular trichomes undergoes partial degradation of the cell wall, producing a highly hydrated, hyaline material that protects the stem apex against desiccation.It is well known that trichomes protect plant organs, and several studies have investigated their role in the adaptation of plants to harsh environments. Recent studies have shown that the production of hydrophilic substances by glandular trichomes and the deposition of this secretion on young organs may facilitate water retention, thus preventing desiccation and favouring organ growth until the plant develops other protective mechanisms. <italic>Lychnophora diamantinana</italic> is a species endemic to the Brazilian â€˜campos rupestresâ€™ (rocky fields), a region characterized by intense solar radiation and water deficits. This study sought to investigate trichomes and the origin of the substances observed on the stem apices of <italic>L. diamantinana.</italic> Samples of stem apices, young and expanded leaves were studied using standard techniques, including light microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Histochemical tests were used to identify the major groups of metabolites present in the trichomes and the hyaline material deposited on the apices. Non-glandular trichomes and glandular trichomes were observed. The material deposited on the stem apices was hyaline, highly hydrophilic and viscous. This hyaline material primarily consists of carbohydrates that result from the partial degradation of the cell wall of uniseriate trichomes. This degradation occurs at the same time that glandular trichomes secrete terpenoids, phenolic compounds and proteins. These results suggest that the non-glandular trichomes on the leaves of <italic>L. diamantinana</italic> help protect the young organ, particularly against desiccation, by deposition of highly hydrated substances on the apices. Furthermore, the secretion of glandular trichomes probably repels herbivore and pathogen attacks.In nature, the trichomes can exhibit an enormous diversity in relation to the morphology, origin, size, location, timing of activity and function; often the trichomes are distinguished as glandular and non-glandular, according to their functions, mainly the capability to secrete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C47">Werker 2000</xref>). It is well known that trichomes protect plant organs, and several studies have investigated their role in the adaptation of plants to harsh environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C11">Fahn 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C47">Werker 2000</xref>). In the stem apices, the trichomes are commonly related to the protection of the young organs: the glandular trichomes release repellent compounds against herbivores and pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C47">Werker 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C41">Siebert 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C16">GÃ¶pfert <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C24">Machado <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>) or also produce hydrophilic substances related to protection against desiccation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C5">Bruni <italic>et al.</italic> 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C12">Fahn 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C34">Paiva and Martins 2011</xref>); and non-glandular trichome acting as a mechanical barrier against excessive light, water loss and extreme temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C13">Fahn and Cutler 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C43">Turner 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C47">Werker 2000</xref>).Traditionally, colleters are secretory structures (emergences or glandular trichomes) more known by production of substances hydrophilic (mucilaginous or resinous), usually found on young organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C12">Fahn 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C33">Paiva and Machado 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C10">Evert 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C32">Paiva 2009</xref>). Recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C26">Mayer <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C34">Paiva and Martins 2011</xref>; Cardoso-Gustavson <italic>et al</italic>. 2014) have shown the functional role of glandular trichomes producing hydrophilic substances on young organs preventing desiccation, maintaining the water status and favouring organ growth. However, more studies on the structure and function of non-glandular trichomes, or covering trichomes are necessary to understand their complete adaptive significance in young organs of plants that are exposed to intense solar radiation and drought.<italic>Lychnophora diamantinana</italic> belongs to Lychnophorinae, a subtribe of Vernonieae (Asteraceae) almost restrict to Cerrado domain in Brazil; the species is endemic to the â€˜campos rupestresâ€™ and is found on rocky outcrops or slopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C7">Coile and Jones 1981</xref>). The â€˜campos rupestresâ€™ are vegetation formations in the Cerrado domain and are characterized by rocky formations with altitudes that are usually greater than 900 m; the soils are shallow, with rapid drainage, acidic and nutrient-poor, with low organic matter content, and originated from the decomposition of quartzite and arenite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C38">Ribeiro and Walter 2008</xref>). These environments experience a dry season and a rainy season, and constant winds, intense solar radiation, daily temperature fluctuations and fires (during the dry season) are common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C15">Goodland and Ferri 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C36">Ratter <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C42">Simon <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). In this environment, the growth and development of new plant organs usually begins in the spring, before the rainy season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C38">Ribeiro and Walter 2008</xref>), and thus, the plant will likely face extreme weather conditions that require the use of mechanisms to protect these organs. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C2">Appezzato-da-GlÃ³ria and Estelita (2000)</xref>, the substances rich in polysaccharides produced in shoot apices can prevent water loss in hot tropical climates, as seen in the Cerrado domain.In this study, we describe for the first time an unusual way for water retention on the stem apices of <italic>L. diamantinana</italic> by the partial degradation of the cell wall of the terminal cells in the non-glandular trichomes. We also identify the origin and structure of the non-glandular trichomes and the secretion of the glandular trichomes, which we consider from a functional perspective.<italic>Lychnophora diamantinana</italic> is distributed along the EspinhaÃ§o Range in the State of Minas Gerais and is found at altitudes between 1300 and 1500 m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C7">Coile and Jones 1981</xref>). The analysed material was collected in the Biribiri State Park, which is in the Municipality of Diamantina, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Voucher specimens were deposited in the SPF Herbarium (University of SÃ£o Paulo) under voucher Loeuille <italic>et al.</italic> 530. Stem apices with leaf primordia, young leaves and completely expanded leaves were collected from three adult individuals, from August to November, during the transition period from the dry to the rainy season.For light microscopy analyses, entire stem apices, entire leaf primordia and the middle third of young and mature leaves were fixed in Karnovsky's solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C21">Karnovsky 1965</xref>, modified using pH 7.2 phosphate buffer), placed in a vacuum chamber to remove the air in the tissues, dehydrated in an ethanol series and embedded in hydroxyethyl methacrylate Leica Historesin<sup>Â®</sup> (Heraeus-Kulzer, Hanau, Germany), following the manufacturer's instructions, and sectioned at 5â€“7 Âµm thickness on a rotary microtome (Model RM 2245, Leica Microsystems Nussloch GmbH, Nussloch, Germany). For structural analysis, the sections were stained with toluidine blue 0.05 % in citrateâ€“phosphate buffer, pH 4.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C39">Sakai 1973</xref>), and mounted in synthetic resin Entellan<sup>Â®</sup> (Merck<sup>Â®</sup>, Darmstadt, Germany).Histochemical reactions were performed using fresh material, including the hyaline substance, and/or embedded material, as described above. The staining reactions included periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) for total polysaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C28">McManus 1948</xref>); calcofluor white M2R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C18">Hughes and McCully 1975</xref>) for cellulose measurements using fluorescence; coriphosphine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C44">Ueda and Yoshioka 1976</xref>) for pectin measurements using fluorescence; Sudan IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C19">Jensen 1962</xref>) for lipophilic substances; NADI reagent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C9">David and Carde 1964</xref>) for terpenoids; ferric chloride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C20">Johansen 1940</xref>) for general phenolic compounds; and aniline blue black (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C14">Fisher 1968</xref>) and xylidine ponceau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C45">Vidal 1970</xref>) for proteins. The sections were examined immediately after each reaction. For the calcofluor white test, the sections were observed under a epifluorescence microscope (Model DM LB, Leica Microsystems Wetzlar GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with an â€˜HBO 100 W mercury vapour lampâ€™ and a violet excitation filter (bandpass filter; 355â€“425 nm). For the coriphosphine test, the induced fluorescence was observed using the same microscope with a blue excitation filter (bandpass filter; 420â€“490 nm). Control sections were examined simultaneously with the histochemical tests, using standard procedures. To determine the natural characteristics of the organs and secretions, untreated sections were mounted and observed. Light microscopy results were recorded using a video camera (DC 300F Leica Microsystems (Schweiz) AG, Heerbrugg, Switzerland) coupled to the Leica<sup>Â®</sup> DM LB microscope to obtain images of the sections.For scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses, samples were fixed in Karnovsky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C21">Karnovsky 1965</xref>) solution for 24 h, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and critical-point dried with CO<sub>2</sub>. The samples were attached to aluminium stubs and coated with gold (30â€“40 nm). Finally, the samples were examined under a LEO VP435 (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) scanning electron microscope at 20 kV.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used for ultrastructure analysis. Samples of entire leaf primordia (2â€“5-mm-long) were collected with tweezers and fixed in glutaraldehyde (2.5 % in 0.1 M, pH 7.3, sodium phosphate buffer) for 24 h, post-fixed with osmium tetroxide (1.0 % in 0.1 M, pH 7.3, sodium phosphate buffer) for 2 hours and incubated in uranyl acetate (0.5 % in aqueous solution). The samples were dehydrated through a graded series of acetone and the material was embedded in Araldite resin. Ultrathin sections were contrasted using uranyl acetate and lead citrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C37">Reynolds 1963</xref>) and were examined under a Philips Model EM 100 transmission electron microscope operating at 80 kV.Morphological characteristics of <italic>L. diamantinana</italic>.

The non-glandular trichomes arise from a protodermal cell with a dense cytoplasm and a conspicuous nucleus (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU088F2">2</xref>H and I); this cell elongates anticlinally and divides periclinally to form two cells (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU088F2">2</xref>J). The cell facing the organ becomes the basal cell of the trichome, while the cell facing the exterior divides periclinally to generate between two and six cells (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU088F2">2</xref>K) and the distal cell expands directly after the last division (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU088F2">2</xref>L). One or more cells will form the peduncle (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU088F2">2</xref>L and D). Next, the terminal cell nucleus elongates (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU088F2">2</xref>D and M) and breaks down, while the other trichome cells remain active and have intact nuclei (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU088F2">2</xref>N).In leaf primordia that are âˆ¼2.5-mm long, modifications occur in the cell wall of the terminal cell of the non-glandular trichomes of the young leaves; these modifications include loosening of the cell-wall structure together with retraction of the protoplasm which becomes denser (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU088F2">2</xref>Oâ€“R).Non-glandular trichomes in leaf primordia of <italic>L. diamantinana.</italic> Transmission electron micrograph of the terminal cell of the trichome.

Histochemical staining: carbohydrates (Ca) by the Schiff reaction (Aâ€“C, F, H, K, P); cellulose (Ce) by calcofluor white (D); pectins (Pe) by coriphosphine (E); lipophilic substances (Ls) by Sudan IV (G, J, L); terpenoids (Te) by the NADI reaction (M); phenolic compounds (Fc) by ferric chloride (N); and proteins (Pt) with aniline blue black (O).Glandular trichomes produce hydrophilic (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU088F4">4</xref>K) and lipophilic substances (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU088F4">4</xref>L) such as polysaccharides (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU088F4">4</xref>K), terpenoids (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU088F4">4</xref>M), phenolic compounds (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU088F4">4</xref>N) and proteins (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU088F4">4</xref>O). Despite this production, the secretion of hydrophilic substances by the glandular trichomes is substantially less than the amount of these substances produced by the partial degradation of the wall of the non-glandular trichomes (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLU088F4">4</xref>P).Cell-wall degradation occurs in a wide variety of situations: as part of normal processes in the plant lifecycle, such as seed germination, xylem vessel formation and the growth, maturation and abscission of fruit; as part of processes where other organisms, such as fungi and herbivores, break down plant material; or even as important tools in industrial processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C4">Brett and Waldron 1990</xref>). However, this study reports for the first time a process of partial cell-wall degradation of the trichome terminal cells in leaf primordia and young leaves, presumably protecting stem apices against dehydration.The non-glandular trichomes in <italic>L. diamantinana</italic> resemble typical non-glandular covering trichomes, because they do not present cells with a dense cytoplasm, which is the characteristic of secretory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C47">Werker 2000</xref>). In these trichomes, the cell wall partially degrades in the leaf primordia, after the elongation of the terminal cells is complete, and simultaneously with changes in the protoplast that lead to cell death. A similar cell-wall degradation and programmed cell death process was described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C17">Gunawardena <italic>et al.</italic> (2007)</xref> for the leaf development in <italic>Aponogeton madagascariensis</italic> (Aponogetonaceae), where the degradation of the cell wall forms perforations during leaf expansion. The authors observed that the components of the cell matrix are degraded, thus exposing a loose fibrillar network, which is sufficiently weakened to allow mechanical rupture. In the non-glandular trichomes from <italic>L. diamantinana</italic>, the cell-wall degradation products will be released after the cuticle rupture and then deposited on the surface of the developing leaves in the stem apices.Our study found that the hyaline substance deposited on the stem apices largely consists of pectic cell-wall carbohydrates. The viscosity and gelation properties of a pectin-containing solution are directly related to its chemical composition and structure because the pectin gels form a three-dimensional crystalline network where the water molecules and their co-solutes are captured and show maximum coalescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C22">LÃ¶fgren and Hermansson 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C35">Paiva <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). The secretion of hydrophilic compounds in plants is associated with the presence of colleters, i.e. trichomes or protrusions that secrete a sticky substance containing a mixture of mucilage or lipophilic substances that cover apical buds to prevent the desiccation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C11">Fahn 1979</xref>). We propose that the hyaline substance observed in <italic>L. diamantinana</italic> has a function analogous to that of colleter secretions based on the following: the similar predominantly hydrophilic composition; the early differentiation of the non-glandular trichomes, which has also been observed in colleters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C2">Appezzato-da-GlÃ³ria and Estelita 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C33">Paiva and Machado 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C26">Mayer <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C27">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C23">Machado <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>); and the brief functional time of these structures, which coincides with the initial developmental phases of the leaf or other apical organs when protection against desiccation is essential because these organs are highly susceptible to dehydration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C2">Appezzato-da-GlÃ³ria and Estelita 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C33">Paiva and Machado 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C32">Paiva 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C27">Mayer <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>).According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C32">Paiva (2009)</xref>, the presence of hydrophilic material, which is produced by colleters, on the young leaves helps to reduce the amount of water that is lost to the external environment and helps to maintain adequate moisture levels in the developing leaf. These actions continue until the leaves develop other types of protection against desiccation, such as forming a thick cuticle. Hygroscopic polysaccharides that are arranged over the cuticle can improve water retention and promote water vapour absorption through the cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C6">Chamel <italic>et al.</italic> 1991</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C30">Miguel <italic>et al.</italic> (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C27">Mayer <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref> also suggested that the exudates produced by colleters could act as a physical barrier, protecting the young organs against dehydration. These functions are particularly important for development of the stem apical structures in <italic>L. diamantinana</italic>, which inhabits the â€˜campos rupestresâ€™. This environment is characterized by intense solar radiation, water scarcity and fires, especially during the dry season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C38">Ribeiro and Walter 2008</xref>); these conditions require increased protection against dehydration. Fog can be found where this species is located, particularly on winter mornings. Thus, the presence of hygroscopic polysaccharides on the stem apices increases the moisture retention under foggy conditions.Several species that inhabit â€˜campos rupestresâ€™ are known by the presence of colleters that provide hydrophilic material, such as species of Apocynaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C40">Sales <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C46">Watanabe <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C31">Morokawa <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>) and Leguminosae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C8">Coutinho <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). Additionally, colleters are related in different families from all over the Cerrado domain that is characterized by fires, nutrient-poor soils, high temperatures and usually with a low water supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C36">Ratter <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C38">Ribeiro and Walter 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C42">Simon <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). In this domain, the colleters are known in other species of Apocynaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C2">Appezzato-da-GlÃ³ria and Estelita 2000</xref>) and in Celastraceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C29">Mercadante-SimÃµes and Paiva 2013</xref>), Leguminosae (Fabaceae) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C33">Paiva and Machado 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C32">Paiva 2009</xref>) and Rubiaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C3">Barreiro and Machado 2007</xref>). In all these cases, the occurrence of hygroscopic polysaccharides on young organs probably plays an important protective function.As reported in this study, in the young leaves of stem apices of <italic>L. diamantinana</italic> were observed glandular trichomes secreting phenolic compounds, lipophilic substances (including terpenoids) and proteins. It is well known that the glandular trichomes are isolated biosynthetically and structurally and for this reason it is probable that they produce large amount of phytotoxic substances that internal leaf tissues could not synthesize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C47">Werker 2000</xref>). In this study, we suggest that besides the non-glandular trichomes supplying mostly carbohydrates and promoting the water retention on apices, the glandular trichomes contribute in the apices protection, mainly with terpenoids, phenolic compounds and proteins, that probably repel herbivore and pathogen attacks. This complex composition was previously registered also in secretions of colleters and it was related to this double protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C30">Miguel <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C33">Paiva and Machado 2006</xref>).In addition, the function of the non-glandular trichomes in the stem apices of <italic>L. diamantinana</italic> could not be restricted to protection against desiccation. The fibrous structure of the non-glandular trichomes after the rupture of the apical cell cuticle is similar to the structure reported in <italic>Helichrysum aureonitens</italic> and <italic>Pteronia incana</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C1">Afolayan and Meyer (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C25">Mayekiso <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref>, respectively. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C1">Afolayan and Meyer (1995)</xref>, the fibrous appearance of these trichomes and their distribution on the leaf would suggest a protective role against herbivores and fungal spores that are spread by wind. Furthermore, trichomes with extremely elongated cells may also protect shorter glandular trichomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="PLU088C47">Werker 2000</xref>). We believe that non-glandular trichomes observed in expanded leaves of <italic>L. diamantinana</italic> probably protect the glandular trichomes, by their disposition, forming fibre meshes over these glands. However, more studies might be able to evaluate the probable function of the fibrous structure remaining from non-glandular trichomes in <italic>L. diamantinana</italic>.The data on the composition and brief deposition time of hygroscopic hyaline substance on the apical stem organs allow us to infer that the non-glandular trichomes of leaf primordia in <italic>L. diamantinana</italic> function similarly to colleters by helping to protect the developing organs against dehydration. Furthermore, the glandular trichomes secrete terpenoids, phenolic compounds and proteins, which probably repel herbivore and pathogen attacks.This work was supported by the <grant-sponsor id="cs1" rid="cn1" xlink:type="simple">National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)</grant-sponsor>â€”grants [Proc. no. <grant-num id="cn1" rid="cs1" xlink:type="simple">302776/2010-9, 302657/2011-8</grant-num>] and the <grant-sponsor id="cs2" rid="cn2" xlink:type="simple">SÃ£o Paulo Council for Research (FAPESP</grant-sponsor>)â€”financial support [Thematic Project Proc. no. <grant-num id="cn2" rid="cs2" xlink:type="simple">2010/51454-3] and grants for the first author [Proc. no. 2010/02085-5</grant-num>].All the authors contributed to a similar extent overall.
