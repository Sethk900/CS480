tolerance of avian embryos: A reviewThe effects of nest size and insulation on thermal properties of Tree Swallow nestsOptimal development of avian embryos occurs within a narrow range of incubation temperatures. Most parents that physically incubate their eggs through direct contact are challenged to balance their time on the nest with taking foraging recesses to satisfy their energetic requirements. To explore the costs and investment strategies of incubating female Wood Ducks (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Aix sponsa</named-content></italic>), we manipulated the microclimate of nests by reducing down insulation from the typical 4.0 g to 0.5 g. Cooling rates of clutches during morning recesses increased when down insulation was reduced, especially at low ambient temperatures. Females with reduced down responded to increased cooling rates by shortening morning recesses and increasing daily incubation constancy, and these behavioral changes were independent of their body mass at the start of incubation. Females in both treatment groups responded similarly to changes in ambient temperature and spent less time incubating as ambient temperatures increased. Clutch temperatures at the end of morning recesses were similar for females with reduced and normal insulation. Average clutch temperatures for the full incubation period did not differ between treatments, and, correspondingly, there were no differences in length of the incubation period, hatching success, or duckling phenotype. Our results show that female Wood Ducks were sensitive to changes in both clutch temperature and ambient temperature and that they modified their time on the nest to provide developing eggs with an optimal thermal environment without negatively affecting their body mass at the end of incubation. Further examination of the limits of behavioral plasticity in incubating birds will be essential, particularly in light of future challenges presented by climate change.El desarrollo &oacute;ptimo de los embriones de aves ocurre dentro de un rango estrecho de temperaturas de incubaci&oacute;n. La mayor&iacute;a de los padres que incuban f&iacute;sicamente sus huevos por medio del contacto directo se enfrentan al desaf&iacute;o de balancear su tiempo en el nido con la toma de recesos para alimentarse y satisfacer sus requerimientos energ&eacute;ticos. Para explorar los costos y las estrategias de inversi&oacute;n de las hembras incubadoras de <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Aix sponsa</named-content></italic>, manipulamos el microclima de los nidos al reducir el aislamiento por plumones de los 4.0 g t&iacute;picos a s&oacute;lo 0.5 g. Las tasas de enfriamiento de las nidadas durante los recesos de la ma&ntilde;ana se incrementaron cuando se redujo el aislamiento por plumones, especialmente a bajas temperaturas ambientales. Las hembras con reducci&oacute;n del plum&oacute;n respondieron al incremento en las tasas de enfriamiento acortando los recesos de la ma&ntilde;ana e incrementando la constancia diaria de incubaci&oacute;n, y estos cambios de comportamiento fueron independientes de su masa corporal al inicio de la incubaci&oacute;n. Las hembras en ambos tratamientos respondieron similarmente a los cambios en la temperatura ambiental y pasaron menos tiempo incubando a medida que las temperaturas ambientales aumentaban. La temperatura de la nidada al final de los recesos de la ma&ntilde;ana fue similar para las hembras con aislamiento normal y reducido. Adem&aacute;s, la temperatura promedio de la nidada por el periodo completo de incubaci&oacute;n no fue diferente entre tratamientos, y no hubo diferencias en la longitud del periodo de incubaci&oacute;n, el &eacute;xito de eclosi&oacute;n, o el fenotipo de los polluelos. Demostramos que las hembras de <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Aix sponsa</named-content></italic> fueron sensibles a los cambios en la temperatura de la nidada y en la temperatura ambiental, y modificaron su tiempo en el nido para brindar a los huevos en desarrollo un ambiente t&eacute;rmico &oacute;ptimo sin afectar negativamente su masa corporal al final del periodo de incubaci&oacute;n.

Therefore, it is clear that incubation is an important reproductive cost in birds that can limit both current and future reproductive success and potentially influence the evolution of avian life histories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Heaney1">Heaney and Monaghan 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Reid1">Reid et al. 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Reid2">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Hepp3">Hepp and Kennamer 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Hepp4">2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-DuRant4">DuRant et al. 2013</xref>).The Wood Duck (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Aix sponsa</named-content></italic>) is a relatively small-bodied, cavity-nesting duck species. Females alone incubate, take 2 recesses day<sup>&minus;1</sup>, and spend &gt;80&percnt; of the day on the nest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Manlove2">Manlove and Hepp 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Folk1">Folk and Hepp 2003</xref>). Conspecific brood parasitism is common in Wood Ducks, and parasitized clutches frequently exceed 20 eggs and result in lengthened incubation periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Hepp5">Hepp et al. 1990</xref>). During egg laying, females remove feather down from their belly and breast to line nests and cover eggs during incubation recesses. Incubation temperature ranges between 34.8&deg;C and 37.8&deg;C, and incubation period averages 32 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Hepp6">Hepp et al. 2006</xref>). Low incubation temperature has been shown to negatively affect offspring quality in Wood Ducks. Embryos of eggs that were artificially incubated at temperatures &lt;35.9&deg;C developed slowly, expended more energy, and hatched with reduced nutrient reserves compared with those incubated at higher temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Hepp6">Hepp et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-DuRant3">DuRant et al. 2011</xref>). Further, these ducklings had higher baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-DuRant1">DuRant et al. 2010</xref>), decreased growth and acquired immunity responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-DuRant2">DuRant et al. 2012a</xref>), and reduced locomotor performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Hopkins1">Hopkins et al. 2011</xref>) and expended more energy for thermoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-DuRant5">DuRant et al. 2012b</xref>) than ducklings from eggs incubated at higher temperatures. Effects of low incubation temperature (&lt;35.9&deg;C) carried over to subsequent life history stages and negatively affected survival, recruitment to the breeding population, and reproductive success of female Wood Ducks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Hepp4">Hepp and Kennamer 2012</xref>). Current evidence suggests that incubation is an important reproductive cost in Wood Ducks, but nesting date and female quality may help mediate these costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Hepp5">Hepp et al. 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Hepp1">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Hepp3">Hepp and Kennamer 2011</xref>).In the present study, we further investigated incubation costs of Wood Ducks by altering the thermal properties of naturally incubated nests. We manipulated the amount of down insulation in nests and examined tradeoffs between female incubation behavior, incubation temperature, and length of the incubation period. We compared females with reduced levels of down (0.5 g) to females with normal levels of down (4.0 g). We predicted that nests with reduced insulation would cool faster during incubation recesses. Because we know that low incubation temperature in Wood Ducks lengthens the incubation period and influences offspring quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-DuRant4">DuRant et al. 2013</xref>), we predicted that females with reduced insulation would seek to maintain optimal incubation temperature by taking shorter incubation recesses and spending more time on the nest. However, investment decisions of incubating females should be condition dependent. Therefore, we predicted that females starting incubation at relatively low body mass would be more likely to invest in self-maintenance than in maintaining optimal egg temperatures.We conducted the study at the U.S. Department of Energy's Savannah River Site in west-central South Carolina, USA (33&deg;1&prime;N, 81&deg;3&prime;W), in January&ndash;July, 2011 and 2012. Wooden nest boxes specific for Wood Ducks had previously been attached to posts and placed over water at Par Pond (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 87) and other wetlands (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 24; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Bellrose1">Bellrose and Holm 1994</xref>). During the present study, nest boxes were checked every 4 days for nesting activity. When nests were located, eggs were measured (length and breadth &lsqb;mm&rsqb;) and chronologically labeled with a permanent marker to record laying order within the clutch. Wood Ducks lay 1 egg day<sup>&minus;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Drobney1">Drobney 1980</xref>), and the date of nest initiation was estimated by subtracting the number of eggs in the nest when it was first discovered from the date the nest was checked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Hepp2">Hepp and Kennamer 1993</xref>). Brood parasitism is common in Wood Ducks, so when the number of eggs in initiated nests outnumbered the days between nest checks, the day after the previous check was assumed to be the day of nest initiation.Incubating females were captured at the nest during the first and last week of incubation. At first capture, unmarked females were banded with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service leg bands and aged as adult (after second year) or yearling (second year; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Harvey1">Harvey et al. 1989</xref>). All females were weighed to the nearest 5 g with a 1,000-g Pesola scale, and tarsus length (&plusmn;0.1 mm), wing length from wrist to edge of longest primary (&plusmn;1 mm), and culmen length (&plusmn;0.1 mm) were measured.We installed temperature data loggers (HOBO U23, Pro version 2; Onset Computer, Bourne, Massachusetts, USA) in nests during egg laying to monitor incubation behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Manlove1">Manlove and Hepp 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Manlove2">2000</xref>). Briefly, all nesting material was removed, and a platform containing a wooden egg with an embedded thermistor was placed in the nest box. The wooden egg was securely fastened to the platform so that the female could not reposition the egg, and the egg with the thermistor was placed in the center of the nest. Nesting material and eggs were returned to the nest, and the wooden egg was positioned so that the thermistor would come in direct contact with the incubating female's brood patch. These loggers recorded temperatures every 6.4 min (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 225 day<sup>&minus;1</sup>). Temperature data were downloaded and plotted for each 24-hr period. Data from these plots provided an accurate method of determining presence and absence of incubating females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Manlove2">Manlove and Hepp 2000</xref>). We used these data to compute morning recess length (min), incubation constancy (percentage of day spent on the nest incubating), and average daily clutch temperature. Incubation was initiated on the first day that females spent portions of the day and night on the nest, and hatch date was the day prior to ducklings exiting the nest box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Hepp6">Hepp et al. 2006</xref>). Incubation period was the number of days between onset of incubation and day of hatching. Any days during which we disturbed the hen's natural incubation rhythm, including days when captures were attempted, were not used in our analysis. In 2012, an iButton (i-Button, Maxim Integrated Products, San Jose, California, USA) was attached with epoxy to the blunt end of the wooden egg to calculate clutch cooling rates (&deg;C min<sup>&minus;1</sup>) during morning incubation recesses. This data logger was positioned in the nest at the same level as the rest of the eggs and recorded temperature every 6 min (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 240 day<sup>&minus;1</sup>).We also installed iButtons inside nest boxes in a standardized location at the back of the box, 10 cm below the entrance hole, to measure ambient nest-box temperature (&plusmn;0.5&deg;C) every 30 min (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 48 day<sup>&minus;1</sup>). Mean daily ambient temperature and mean morning ambient temperatures were calculated for each box. Morning temperatures were calculated from 0500 to 1000 hours to coincide with the period of morning recess activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Bellrose1">Bellrose and Holm 1994</xref>).We considered full incubation to have started when females began spending portions of both the day and night on the nest. On the morning of the fifth day of full incubation, we manipulated the amount of down insulation in nests to either normal (4.0 g) or reduced (0.5 g) amounts. All insulation in the nest was removed and replaced with cleaned, premeasured down. The normal amount of down was similar to amounts measured previously in natural nests on Par Pond (3.8 &plusmn; 1.2 g; <italic>n</italic> &equals; 12). Manipulations of down were completed when females were away from the nest during early-morning recesses to minimize disturbance to incubating females. A pilot study in 2011 showed that females (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 10) with reduced down (0.5 g) compensated very little for the loss of down, adding just 0.03 &plusmn; 0.17 g. We also standardized the clutch to the first 12 viable eggs at this time. In subsequent visits to the nest, any new eggs were removed, because nests were sometimes parasitized after the start of incubation. We visited nests after ducklings had fledged to determine hatching success.We chose to reduce down to 0.5 g because it successfully increased cooling rates across different ambient temperatures while still leaving enough down to allow for a thin layer to cover the eggs. Egg cooling rates for 4.0 g and 0.5 g of down were tested in environmental chambers (Environmental Growth Chambers, Chagrin Falls, OH, USA) with temperatures set at 7&deg;C, 15&deg;C, and 22&deg;C (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 6, <italic>n</italic> &equals; 10, and <italic>n</italic> &equals; 10, respectively). Clutches of 12 undeveloped Wood Duck eggs were warmed in incubators to an average temperature of 37.6&deg;C. To accurately measure egg temperatures, we drilled a small hole in 1 of the eggs, placed a thermistor in the albumen, and sealed the hole with silicone gel. Warmed clutches were placed immediately into nest boxes in the environmental chamber. Egg temperature was recorded every 1.2 min (Stowaway, Onset Computer, Bourne, MA, USA), and eggs were allowed to cool for 2 hr. Cooling rates from these clutches were linearly estimated and averaged for each treatment and temperature group.During the last week of incubation in 2012, we randomly selected and removed 2 eggs (1 each from early &lsqb;days 2&ndash;5&rsqb; and late &lsqb;days 7&ndash;9&rsqb; in the laying sequence) from each experimental nest (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 24). These eggs were brought to the lab and placed in an incubator at 37.6&deg;C. When eggs pipped, they were transferred to a brooder to hatch. Hatched ducklings were weighed and sexed, and the tarsus and culmen were measured within 12 hr of hatching. Ducklings were euthanized using CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation and cervical dislocation. Ducklings were placed in individually labeled plastic bags and frozen for later processing.Duckling body composition was determined using methods of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Hepp6">Hepp et al. (2006)</xref>. Ducklings were thawed and dried (65&deg;C) to constant mass. Dry ducklings were ground and neutral lipids were extracted from whole ducklings in a Soxhlet apparatus using petroleum ether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Dobush1">Dobush et al. 1985</xref>). Lean samples were dried to constant mass, and lipid content was the difference in mass of the dry sample before and after lipid extraction. Total lipid mass was calculated by multiplying the proportion of lipid in the dry, ground sample by the dry mass of the whole duckling. Lean dry mass was calculated by multiplying the proportion of nonlipid material in the dry, ground sample after lipid extraction and dry duckling mass. Lean dry samples were burned in a muffle furnace at 550&deg;C for 10 hr to determine ash content. Ash-free lean dry mass (AFLDM) was calculated as the difference between ash content of burned sample and lean dry mass. The proportion of AFLDM in the sample multiplied by the dry mass of the duckling provided an estimate of the duckling's protein mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Ricklefs1">Ricklefs 1974</xref>).All data summaries and statistical tests were completed using SAS 9.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-SASInstitute1">SAS Institute 2011</xref>). We tested effects of insulation treatment and ambient temperature on clutch cooling rates during morning recesses and clutch temperature at the end of morning recesses using mixed linear models (Proc MIXED) and restricted maximum-likelihood (REML) methods. We evaluated the covariance structure of models using Akaike's Information Criterion and chose autoregressive covariance for use in all mixed linear models. Insulation treatment and ambient nest-box temperature were fixed effects, nests were random effects, and repeated measures were used within nests. Interaction effects of insulation treatment and ambient temperature were removed from the model if effects were not significant (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05).Mixed linear models with repeated measures and an autoregressive covariance structure were fitted with REML and used to test effects of insulation treatment on morning recess length, incubation constancy, and daily clutch temperature. Models included fixed effects of insulation treatment, daily ambient nest-box temperature, day of incubation, early incubation female body mass, as well as the interaction of treatment with incubation day, female body mass, and ambient nest-box temperature. Individual females and repeated measures within nests were accounted for using random effects. We arcsine-transformed the square root of constancy before analysis.We used one-way analyses of variance (Proc GLM) to test for differences in initiation date of incubation, incubation period length, early and late incubation body mass of females, percentage change in body mass, and hatching success (&percnt;). We arcsine-transformed the square root of hatching success and percent change in body mass before analysis. Effects of insulation treatment on wet and dry masses of ducklings and their body components (lipid, protein, and ash) were tested using mixed linear models. Models accounted for the fixed effects of insulation treatment and fresh egg mass, random effects of nests, and repeated measures of eggs within nests. For mixed linear models, we present least-squares means and use Tukey's test for separation of means; otherwise, means &plusmn; SE are presented.Nests were randomly assigned to treatments in 2011 and 2012, and we manipulated the amount of insulation in Wood Duck nests (normal insulation, 4.0 g, <italic>n</italic> &equals; 17; reduced insulation, 0.5 g, <italic>n</italic> &equals; 17) on day 5.12 &plusmn; 0.16 of incubation. Date of incubation initiation did not differ between treatments (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,&thinsp;32</sub> &equals; 1.33, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.28) and averaged March 25 &plusmn; 2 days (range: March 7&ndash;April 30). Body mass of females at the onset of incubation was 567.5 &plusmn; 5.5 g (range: 495&ndash;635 g) and did not differ between treatments (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,&thinsp;32</sub> &equals; 0.52, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.49).In 2012, we measured cooling rates of clutches (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 9 normal and <italic>n</italic> &equals; 10 reduced insulation) during 447 morning recesses. Insulation treatment (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,&thinsp;17</sub> &equals; 17.42, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.0007), ambient nest-box temperature (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,&thinsp;426</sub> &equals; 339.57, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), and the interaction of treatment and ambient nest-box temperature (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,&thinsp;426</sub> &equals; 9.13, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.003) influenced clutch cooling rates. Clutch temperature declined more slowly with increasing ambient nest-box temperature for nests with normal insulation (&beta; &equals; &minus;0.0033 &plusmn; 0.0003&deg;C min<sup>&minus;1</sup>) than for nests with reduced insulation (&beta; &equals; &minus;0.0046 &plusmn; 0.0003&deg;C min<sup>&minus;1</sup>).

Our experiments with egg cooling rates in environmental chambers showed similar effects of insulation treatment and ambient temperature on cooling rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-f01">Figure 1</xref>). Eggs with reduced insulation cooled faster than eggs with normal amounts of insulation, and these differences increased as ambient temperature declined.Mean (&plusmn; SE) cooling rates of Wood Duck eggs housed in environmental chambers at 7&deg;C, 15&deg;C, and 22&deg;C with normal (4.0 g) and reduced (0.5 g) feather down insulation.Temperature of clutches at the end of morning recesses was not influenced by the interactions of insulation treatment with ambient nest-box temperature (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,&thinsp;425</sub> &equals; 0.39, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.53) or female body mass at the onset of incubation (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,&thinsp;425</sub> &equals; 0.26, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.61) , so the interaction terms were dropped from the model.

Least-squares mean temperature of clutches when females returned from morning recesses was 30.48 &plusmn; 0.55&deg;C for nests with normal insulation and 29.95 &plusmn; 0.52&deg;C for nests with reduced insulation.

Least-squares mean incubation constancy was greater for females with reduced insulation (84.48 &plusmn; 0.58&percnt;) than for females with normal insulation (81.89 &plusmn; 0.61&percnt;; <italic>t</italic> &equals; 3.07, df &equals; 31, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.004).Daily clutch temperatures (<italic>n</italic> &equals; 17 normal and <italic>n</italic> &equals; 17 reduced insulation) were measured for 686 days. Interactions of insulation treatment with ambient nest-box temperature (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,&thinsp;648</sub> &equals; 1.62, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.20), female body mass at the onset of incubation (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,&thinsp;30</sub> &equals; 3.17, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.09), and day of incubation (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,&thinsp;648</sub> &equals; 0.86, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.35) did not affect clutch temperature, so interaction terms were removed from the model.

Daily clutch temperature also did not vary with insulation treatment (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,&thinsp;31</sub> &equals; 0.95, <italic>P</italic> &equals; 0.34). Least-squares mean clutch temperature was 36.63 &plusmn; 0.14&deg;C for females with reduced insulation and 36.82 &plusmn; 0.14&deg;C for females with normal insulation.We averaged daily clutch temperatures for each nest.

All comparisons between reduced- and normal-insulation nests were not significant (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05).Body mass and body composition (least-squares mean &plusmn; SE) of day-old Wood Duck ducklings hatched from nests with reduced (0.5 g) and normal (4.0 g) levels of down insulation. Fresh egg mass (mean &plusmn; SE) was used as the covariate. All least-squares means within rows are not significantly different (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05).We altered the microclimate of Wood Duck nests by manipulating the amount of down insulation. Clutches of eggs with reduced levels of down cooled faster than clutches with normal amounts of down, and differences in cooling rates were greater at low ambient temperatures. Females with reduced down insulation responded to increased cooling rates by shortening morning recesses and increasing overall incubation constancy. These behavioral changes were not influenced by female body mass. Plasticity of incubation behaviors helped females maintain an optimal thermal environment for developing embryos. Average clutch temperature (36.6&deg;C) for the full incubation period was similar between insulation treatments and was greater than incubation temperatures (&lt;35.9&deg;C) known to negatively affect a suite of phenotypic traits in Wood Duck neonates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Hepp6">Hepp et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Hepp4">Hepp and Kennamer 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-DuRant4">DuRant et al. 2013</xref>).

Modifying incubation behaviors, as we have shown in Wood Ducks, is one method that affects incubation temperature and has been reported in many species (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Martin1">Martin et al. 2007</xref>).

Further, parents at temperate latitudes can mediate the costs of incubation and help maintain optimal nest temperatures by simply nesting later in the season, when ambient temperatures are warmer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Hepp3">Hepp and Kennamer 2011</xref>).Recent studies have shown that Wood Duck eggs incubated at low temperatures developed more slowly and that embryos used more energy and hatched with fewer residual lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Hepp6">Hepp et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-DuRant3">DuRant et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Hepp4">Hepp and Kennamer 2012</xref>). These ducklings also had poor locomotor skills, reduced growth rates, reduced levels of immunocompetence, increased stress levels, and increased costs of thermoregulation compared with ducklings incubated at higher temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-DuRant1">DuRant et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-DuRant3">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-DuRant2">2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-DuRant5">2012b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Hopkins1">Hopkins et al. 2011</xref>). Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Hepp4">Hepp and Kennamer (2012)</xref> showed that ducklings incubated at low temperatures were less likely to survive and reproduce than ducklings incubated at higher temperatures. Negative impacts of low incubation temperature also have been reported for other birds. For example, low incubation temperature negatively influenced the subsequent growth and metabolism of Blue Tits (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Cyanistes caeruleus</named-content></italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Nord1">Nord and Nilsson 2011</xref>) and the growth and innate immune function of Tree Swallows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Ardia3">Ardia et al. 2010</xref>). However, effects of these phenotypic differences on fitness are still relatively unexplored.It is clear that proper care of eggs is important for optimal reproductive success in birds, but incubation constancy and incubation temperature often vary within and between species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Hepp6">Hepp et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Hepp3">Hepp and Kennamer 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Martin2">Martin et al. 2013</xref>). Incubation is costly for parents, and these costs increase with decreasing ambient temperature and increasing clutch size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Reid2">Reid et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Tinbergen1">Tinbergen and Williams 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Nord3">Nord et al. 2010</xref>). Parents that were energetically constrained often invested more in self-maintenance and spent less time on the nest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Ardia1">Ardia et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-MacDonald1">MacDonald et al. 2013</xref>). However, tradeoffs can be mediated by parental quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Hanssen1">Hanssen et al. 2003</xref>). In Wood Ducks, heavy females that were in good condition nested earlier, spent more time incubating, and lost more weight than females in poor condition that nested later in the season, when ambient temperatures were warmer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Hepp3">Hepp and Kennamer 2011</xref>).In the present study, female Wood Ducks did not appear to be energetically constrained. For example, they began incubation in better body condition than females from an earlier study of this population (567 vs. 543 g; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Hepp3">Hepp and Kennamer 2011</xref>) and lost &lt;3&percnt; of their body mass during incubation. As incubation costs increased with declining ambient temperature and greater clutch cooling rates, females spent more time on nests to keep eggs warm rather than investing in self-maintenance. These behavioral changes kept eggs at optimal developmental temperatures without negatively affecting female body condition. However, if environmental conditions had been more severe (i.e. colder temperatures or reduced habitat quality), we would have expected females, especially those starting incubation in relatively poor condition, to have reduced incubation effort and sacrificed clutch temperatures for self-maintenance. Modifying strategies and investing more in self-maintenance makes sense when females are energetically constrained, because finishing incubation at low body mass can reduce female survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="i0004-8038-131-4-672-Hepp5">Hepp et al. 1990</xref>).We found that female Wood Ducks generally managed incubation costs successfully. Females were sensitive to changes in both ambient temperature and cooling rate of clutches and modified incubation behaviors to successfully maintain an optimal nest microclimate without affecting their body condition. The ability of females to make these changes and provide embryos with an optimal thermal environment ultimately depends on individual quality and prevailing environmental conditions. Incubation is an important reproductive cost, and successfully negotiating this cost can affect neonate quality as well as the survival and future reproduction of parents. In the future, how anticipated changes in climate and habitat quality influence tradeoffs between parents and offspring during this important period of reproduction in birds will be important areas of investigation.Thanks are due to our field crew, J.
