Water-Distance-Based Kriging in Chesapeake BayAbstractThe complex shapes of estuaries need to be considered when developing spatial interpolation methods for water quality analyses. In this study, a statistical interpolation method (kriging) is used to interpolate water quality data in Chesapeake Bay, and the issue of shape is addressed by incorporating â€œwater distanceâ€ into the method (i.e.,Â the shortest path over water between any two points). Results show that water-distance-based kriging performed just as well as, and in most cases better than, a kriging method based on Euclidean distance. Benefits of the water-distance-based method with kriging include improved estimates in regions with complex geometry and lower uncertainty in the kriging predictions.
