Revalidation of Hepsetus cuvieri (Castelnau, 1861) (Characiformes: Hepsetidae) from the Quanza, Zambezi and southern part of the Congo ichthyofaunal provincesHepsetus cuvieri (Castelnau, 1861), originally described from â€œlac N'gamiâ€ (Botswana) and synonymized with H. odoe (Bloch, 1794) by Roberts (1984), is revalidated. Hepsetus cuvieri can be readily distinguished from H. odoe based on a lower total number of gill rakers (8â€“13 versus 14â€“21); a generally higher number of scales between the dorsal fin and the lateral line (10Â½â€“11Â½ versus 7Â½â€“10Â½) and a higher number of scales between the adipose fin and the lateral line (6Â½â€“7Â½ versus 4Â½â€“6Â½) and other characters. A neotype is designated, as the holotype of this nominal species is apparently lost. Hepsetus cuvieri is restricted to the Quanza, Zambezi ichthyofaunal provinces and the southern part of the Congo Basin, i.e. the Congo ichthyofaunal province.
