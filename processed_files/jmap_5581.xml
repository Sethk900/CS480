Spatial and temporal distribution of zooplankton in Lake Trichonis (Greece)The investigation of the zooplankton community in Lake Trichonis during a twoâ€year survey (September 2003â€“August 2005) revealed 37 invertebrate species (26 rotifers, three copepods, seven cladocerans and one mollusc larva). The seasonal distribution followed a biacmic pattern in the first year and a monoacmic in the second. Copepoda prevailed, with the calanoid Eudiaptomus driesci being the dominant species. No differences in the horizontal distribution of the zooplankton community were found. The maximum abundance of the zooplankton community was recorded in the surface 0â€“10Â m layer and abundance decreased with depth. The most important species of rotifers follow a vertical separation pattern, while the cladocerans revealed either a seasonal succession of dominance, or a vertical separation. Although Lake Trichonis holds the basic characteristics of an oligotrophic lake, the presence of certain species typical of eutrophic lakes, could reflect a possible alteration of its trophic state.
