Field evaluation of leaf rust severity, yield loss and quality characteristics in near-isogenic wheat lines with Lr29, Lr35 or Lr37The potential of three Lr genes in the wheat lines RL6080 (Thatcher*6/Lr29), RL6081 (Thatcher*8/Lr37) and RL6082 (Thatcher*6/Lr35) was evaluated in field experiments. Leaf rust reaction types on flag leaves of lines with Lr29, Lr35 or Lr37 varied between resistance and moderate susceptibility. Severity ratings on these lines did not exceed 5%. Leaf rust infection reduced grain mass in Thatcher by 10.4% whereas lines with Lr29, Lr35 or Lr37did not sustain significant losses (+1.0, 2.6 and 1.0%, respectively). According to grain and flour protein concentration, flour yield, loaf volume and the baking strength index, no deleterious quality characteristics appeared to be genetically associated with Lr29, Lr35 or Lr37. The dough development time of RL6080 was shorter, and that of RL6081 longer than the control.
