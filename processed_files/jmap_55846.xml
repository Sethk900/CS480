Surface modelling of soil properties based on land use informationHigh accuracy surface modelling (HASM) is a spatial interpolation technique based on the fundamental theorem of surfaces. This study proposed a modified HASM method based on the incorporation of ancillary land use information (HASM_LU) for improved interpolation of soil properties. To assess its feasibility, a total of 150 samples were collected in different land use types (woodlands, croplands and grasslands) of a typical red soil region in the middle part of Jiangxi Province, China. Observations on soil pH, alkali-hydrolyzable N (AN), total C, N, K, Al, Ca, Mg and Zn were interpolated. To evaluate the performance of HASM_LU, it was compared with four other interpolators: HASM, ordinary kriging with land use information (OK_LU), stratified kriging (SK) and regression-kriging using a generalized linear model (RK_GLM). To do so, predicted and measured values were compared using the mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and prediction efficiency (PE). The results have shown that HASM_LU generally performs better than HASM, OK_LU, SK and RK_GLM with a lower estimation bias, MAE and RMSE as well as greater PE. In particular, the RMSE of HASM_LU for AN was smaller than that of HASM by 33.4%; that of OK_LU, 1.6%; that of SK, 41.5%; and that of RK_GLM, 67.6%. The largest difference in PE occurred when comparing HASM_LU with HASM for N (57.95%), with OK_LU (7.18%) for K, with SK (125.16%) for Zn and with RK_GLM (100.21%) for AN. The HASM_LU maps of soil properties present more details and more accurate spatial patterns. The good performance of HASM_LU can be attributed to the adequate surface modelling ability of HASM, combined with incorporation of information on abrupt spatial boundaries introduced by land use.
