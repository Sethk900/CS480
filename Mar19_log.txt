Today has been somewhat frustrating. 

The good news is that I managed to install all of the necessary geonames on a new SUSE Linux EC2 instance, which I provisioned with 50 GiB of EBS memory. 
The bad news is that once I did so, I ran into some difficult-to-decipher networking issues that make it impossible for me to initialize mordecai's
geoparser. 

I chipped away at this issue for several hours, poring over StackOverflow, updating packages and dependencies, messing around with the ports on the EC2 isntance, 
and all for nothing. At the end of the day I wasn't able to figure out what exactly is causing the issue, much less what I should do to solve it. 

With that said, there are a few things that I observed which may indicate where I should start looking for potential solutions

First and foremost, the root of the error messages appears to be an inability to connect to port 9200 on the EC2 instance while initializing the geoparser.
This port is used by Elasticsearch, which is running in the docker container used by mordecai's geoparser. So basically, it appears that any time mordecai 
attempts to reference that port for elasticsearch query purposes, the connection is refused, thus resulting in a connection refused (Errno 111) error
that terminates the initialization and prevents me from using the geoparser.

If I were using Elasticsearch as an installed service on the host, then there may be some settings that I could toggle around in order to potentially fix this
issue. However, since Elasticsearch is running in a Docker container, and the image for that container is administrated by the folks who work on Mordecai,
there's really nothing I can do to toggle the Elasticsearch settings.

So, at this point I've resorted to asking a question on StackOverflow. It is quite probable that this question won't yield anything particularly helpful;
my plan right now is to leave it up for a day or two, then post an issue to the Mordecai github page so that the devs can weigh in on the problem. I know that
that could be intrusive and unprofessional, but I'm willing to take the chance just in case the reason that it isn't working has to do with something on their end. 
Anyways, it could be a good learning experience. 

Between now and then, I also plan to look into alternative geoparsers so that we can start pulling out values to populate feature vectors for input to a binary
classification ML model and flag journal study locations. I'll start with geoparsepy and then probably branch out into some non-python options, though that could
make our whole parsing and feature selection process somewhat more tedious.
