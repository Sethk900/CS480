Standup Meeting Notes
18 February 2021

Since our last meeting, Dr. Karl dumped a bunch of XML files to our fileshare. 
We can now begin developing pipelines to process that data and start building NLP models. 

In this meeting I also brought up AWS and Databricks as potential tools for development and collaboration moving forward.
I tried gaining free-tier student access to these resources, but Databricks is currently refactoring the registration portal
for their community version. Also, presumably this version does not allow for collaboration, but I think by that they may
simply mean that multiple people can't edit a notebook at one time, or that individual users can't share clusters within organizations
(come to think of it, it's probably the latter-- the community version understandably has strictly regulated compute resources). 
Need to look into it further, but for now there is no straight-forward method for registering for and receiving free compute 
hours from Databricks, let alone cloud computing resources from AWS (though, come to think of it, that probably won't be much 
more difficult -- AWS is somewhat liberal with free-tier resources for students, and their sales reps can be very accomodating)_.

Further updates since last meeting:
	- No further word from Professor Bolden regarding our next full-class meeting
	- Will and Toby now keeping up on logbook entries
	- Dr. Karl delivered articles (mostly in XML format, though the details vary) to serve as train/test data 

Action items:
	- Seth: examine services offered by Databricks, Azure, and AWS
	- Will: Scrutinize the GitHub repo to 
	- Toby: Start drafting Python scripts  
	- Convert the various formats of the XML files into a single format that basically just contain the location data (lat/long/name) and raw text of the article
	- All: Start digging through the various datasets to determine exactly what we have for a given dataset (i.e. is there any labeled location data? If so, where?
	- Look for and read docmentation on the file formats
