CS480 - Log Notes
20 March 2021

I started out today by running a range of package updates in the EC2 instance, in the hopes that they would somehow resolve my error. No such luck.

Another attempted solution consisted of trying a couple of different methods to elevate the permissions with which the Docker container runs.
Specifically, I ran it with root permissions, and then created a user to whom I allocated a couple different forms of access. Then I designated this 
user when running the docker container. 

Even so, didn't have any luck. 

Next, I'm thinking of opening an issue for this problem on the Mordecai Github page, as mentioned in yesterday's notes. 

Under the assumption that the mordecai devs probably won't respond over the weekend anyways, I started drafting a presentation to give my teammates and the 
sponsor a substantial update on my work over spring break (limited as the results have been) and what our plan could/should be going forward. 

The project is starting to become a little bit less abstract, which is good-- but I am a little bit disappointed with the lack of tangible results from my results
working over spring break. Hopefully my teammates will pitch in on some of these issues in the coming weeks, but in the meantime I suppose that this will serve
as a decent foundation.
