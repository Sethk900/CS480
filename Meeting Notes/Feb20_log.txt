Today, I spent a few hours investigating free-tier services offered by Databricks and Amazon Web Services (AWS).
In theory, if there are sufficient free-tier services offered, then we could use them for collaboration and compute jobs on our capstone project. 

First, I looked into AWS Educate, a campaign by which students can access grants to use AWS resources for free. My steps were as follows:
	1. Created an account using my school email
	2. Activated an AWS starter account, which allows me to use up to $100 worth of AWS services for free in a 3rd party's environment
		- May not be entirely ideal for collaboration, since our project members wouldn't be members of an organization (?)
	3. Agreed to Vocareum's terms of service (pretty reasonable, since the account is operated in their AWS environment)
	4. Explored the list of AWS services supported in Vocareum's environment
		- For our project, the most relevant of these are probably S3 and EC2 (storage and compute, respectively)
		- Not all types of EC2 nodes are available, but that should't be a huge problem
	5. Poked around the AWS console a little bit. This is probably where we'll spend most of our time doing actual work. 

Next, I closed out AWS for now and shifted over to look at Databricks. Ultimately, the goal here would be to store our input files on S3, implement our pipeline
via Databricks (running on AWS), and run our models from there. I'm still a little unsure about where we might want to train and test our models, but maybe in
a Lambda or in Databricks? We will have to dig into that more later. 
The steps that I took to look into Databricks were as follows:
	1. Opened up the page for the Databricks University Alliance (databricks.com/university)
		- Although this was the first option to come up, it looks like it's intended for educators rather than students. I'll look elsewhere for now.
	2. Next, moved on to the sign-up page for the Databricks Comunity Edition (free).
	3. Although this page was down for maintenance a few days ago when I tried the first time, this time it worked: I signed up with my school email and,
	after validating my email, was allowed to access the Databricks interface.
