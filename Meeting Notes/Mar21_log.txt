CS480 - Log Notes
21 March 2021

Today I continued testing out some different random things to try to get the SUSE instance, but to no avail. 

Started drafting up a professional-ish message to open up an issue on the mordecai Github page. I'm going to be embarassed if it turns out to be something 
simple on my end, like an update that I neglected to run, but it is worth the risk.

I also finished up the PowerPoint presentation that I will use to update my teammates on my progress over break at our meeting tomorrow night, and Dr. Karl at our
standup on Tuesday afternoon. 

All said and done, I spent about two hours on the project today. Some of it (i.e. the work on the EC2 isntance) wasn't particularly helpful, but some of it (i.e.
working on the presentation) produced some helpful plans and a useful update that can be used to ensure that our team and sponsors are on track. 

As another note, I should try to reach out to Professor Bolden again tomorrow regarding the timeline for snapshot 1. We haven't heard from him in quite some time, 
and even though I've reached out twice I have received no response. None of the other CS480 students on teh UI CS Discord server seem to have heard anything either.
