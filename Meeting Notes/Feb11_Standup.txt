Team Standup Meeting Notes
11 February 2021

What should we all be working on right now?
No data from Dr. Karl yet: data pre-processing/cleaning not necessarily an option
	- Send Dr. Karl a reminder? We can give him until next week to reorganize
	- Start pulling sample data straight from JournalMap?
Read through some documentation pertaining to or describing typical project structures and timelines for NLP projects
	- This will allow us to familiarize ourselves with conventional workflows on these types of projects
	- Should also give us a decent idea of how to handle our own project

During the meeting, we discussed progress made on the logbooks so far. Will and Toby need to catch up a little, but should be able
to do so over the long weekend.

Additionally, we decided not to remind Dr. Karl that he said he would provide us with an initial dump of test data, because
he indicated that he would need to clean up this data a little bit before passing it on to us. Presumably, he's still doing 
this, and we'll be able to touch base about it on Tuesday.

In the meantime, each team member will go through a few different tutorials to better understand how NLP works and how NLP 
projects are typically strucutred. Presumably, this will allow us to better structure our own project.
	- This could mean changes or additions to our Gantt chart after we have a better idea of our work moving forward. 
Toby and Will will also catch up on logbooks. 

Finally, we noted that we may have a group session with the other CS students and Professor Bolden some time next week. 
We aren't sure exactly what will go on for that meeting, but assume that he will ask how our projects have started out 
and may give us information regarding the first snapshot assignment.
