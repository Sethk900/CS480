CS480 - Team and Sponsor Meeting Notes
04 March 2021

Today, the development team (Will, Seth, Toby) met with Jeremy and Dr. Karl to do a check-in meeting. 
The main order of business was the pipeline. I had sent Dr. Karl a workflow diagram last week and asked if he would be alright with us storing some of the 
articles on S3. 

Progress report:
Besides the pipeline, we have started to write parsing scripts with python that could either be run on a cloud platform via Databricks, or on a local machine.
This will convert the data to what I refer to a s "gold" data in the workflow diagram. 
From here, we're about to shift our focus away from pipelining. I (Seth) can hang back a little bit to keep establishing the pipeline as we move along, but we're really
looking forward to moving into the actual NLP portion on the project. 
This will consist of the installation and testing of open-source NLP models, like Mordecai, on the test data. 

Other NLP modules;
	- SpaCY 
	- Stanza
	- Mordecai
	- NLTK

Note from Jeremy:
	- Keep track of where in the document a place name appears
	
Make sure to cut out all of the reference text when parsing 

It would be great to cross-reference place names that are found with species names
	- ITIS.gov: a potential source of a list of species name that we can use for crossreferencing
	- Can bulk download the entire list as needed
		- May also have an API that we can hit, but depending on the list size it should be manageable to cross-reference with the entire list
			- Could be a nice chance to try out our algorithm-writing skills
