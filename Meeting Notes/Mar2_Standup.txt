CS480 - Team Standup Meeting Notes
02 March 2020

We had a standup today, but unfortunately Will and Toby both got called into separate meetings unexpectedly, so it looks like it's just me on a Zoom
call by myself.

I used our regularly-scheduled standup time to continue working on scripts and to start to think about how we will divvy up the workloads associated with the actual 
ML/NLP portion of the project. 

It seems like I have the most experience with data engineering, so I should probably be the one to spearhead pipelining. At our next standup I'll probably 
suggest that the other two team members shift their focus towards ML/NLP instead of pipelining so that we can keep the project moving along. 

With that said, I don't want my role on this project to be entirely defined as the group's data engineer. I want to shift my focus alongside my teammates
and be able to focus strictly on NLP within the next couple of weeks. Of course, there will always be data wrangling and pipelining associated with that process, 
but I'm just saying that I don't want to get bogged down working on the pipeline while my teammates complete the whole core of the project. Even so, I can 
hang back to finish any initial pipelining work that we have left while they start to move forward with NLP-related taskwork.
