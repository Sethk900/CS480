Semester Project - Standup Meeting Notes
23 February 2021

At the standup meeting today, I intend to present the group with platforming options (e.g. free-tier AWS and Databricks
for group collaboration. 
	- If the group is comfortable with it, we can move forward to getting everyone set up with accounts and taking the free-tier services for AWS and 
	Databricks so that they can serve as a collaborative remote computing space for us going forward. 

Updates:
I pitched AWS and Databricks to Will: he seemed generally to agree with the advantages, but noted that we should get Dr. Karl's permission before hosting 
any JournalMap data remotely (i.e. in AWS S3 or Databricks' DBFS)
We went over the architecture: there are improvements that could be made, such as writing to DBFS rather than S3 for the bronze-to-gold and gold-to-platinum
notebooks to save on S3 charges, but in general it seemed like a decent workflow.

Will went over the JournalMap GitHub organization:
	- JLIS_Geoparsers has a great README that explains how it works
	There are two parser files that, ideally, our product could end up replacing:
		- jmap_geoparser.py: the pyparse-based geoparser
		- jmpar_geoparser_re.py: the regex-based geoparser
	There are a couple of other versions of the files, but they seem to be mostly more tweaked
	- in DataImport: jmapParseXML.py: an IMPORTANT script that calls the geoparser scripts
		- We may be able to recycle some of this code to feed input to a given .py file
			- This would allow us to develop a local pipeline alongside the remote one
	- GeoParsers has significantly more files and is likely the working version, but the documentation isn't as robust
	- The big takeaway from the GitHub is that a lot of the pipelining/formatting has already been done, to some extent, by Dr. Karl's code. If we spend less time
	figuring that out than it would take us to write code from scratch, then it could be advantageous to us. 

Action items before Thursday standup:
	- Seth:
		- Spend a few hours reading up on the JournalMap GitHub to start thinking about how our code will interface with the existing architecture
		- Start drafting up simple Python scripts for the bronze-to-gold Databricks notebook
		- Draft an email to Dr. Karl updating him on our activities and requesting additional documentation if he has any
	- Will:
		- Keep reading through the Github and attempting to understand how our code will interface with the existing architecture
		- Create accounts for the Databricks and AWS free tiers, as specified in my Feb20 log notes
	- Toby: (if he has time)
		- Continue writing sample script to pull out relevant data from XML files and consolidate them in specially-formatted .txt files
		- Create accounts for the Databricks and AWS free tiers, as specified in my Feb20 log notes
		- Spend some time familiarizing yourself with the JournalMap GitHub: the files noted above, which Will found while he was looking over 
		the code, would be a good place to start.
